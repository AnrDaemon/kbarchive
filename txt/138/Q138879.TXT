SUMMARY
=======

SpartaCom's Asynchronous Port Sharing software, or SAPS, is a 3rd party modem
sharing solution for Windows NT. SAPS allows computers on a network to access
pooled modems for outbound calls. Even if you configure one or more modem ports
for outbound calls, you can still receive calls from the Windows NT Remote
Access Service if the port isn't currently in use. SpartaCom does not currently
support RAS client dial-out on their shared modems.

SpartaCom can be reached by phone by calling (404) 455-0701 or by fax at (404)
457-9500. The location of SpartaCom's World Wide Web page is WWW.SPARTACOM.BE
(European) or WWW.TSPCO.COM (North American).
