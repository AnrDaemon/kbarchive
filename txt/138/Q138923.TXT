TITLE   :Partitions Displaying as Unknown in Disk Administrator
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Disk Administrator displays an NTFS partition as unknown if the permissions on
the root of the partition are changed. When you attempt to access the partition
through File Manager, you receive the following error message:

   You do not have permissions to access directory.

If you try to access the drive from a command prompt, you receive the following
error message:

   Access denied.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs when a second partition or volume set is created and the group,
"Everyone" is removed from the Access Control List(ACL) and then a specific user
is granted access. The single user has normal access, but when other users log
on or if Windows NT is reinstalled, Disk Administrator sees the drive as
unknown.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, log in as an administrator and take ownership of all
directories or add the group Everyone back with full control (default).
