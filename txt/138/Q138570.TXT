TITLE   :PRB: LIST STRUCTURE Command Truncates Long Field Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the LIST STRUCTURE command on a table that has long field names and that
is part of a database, results in a truncated list of field names. The full
field name, as it appears in the database, does not display.

CAUSE
=====

The LIST STRUCTURE command looks at the underlying table, not the information
contained in the database.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
