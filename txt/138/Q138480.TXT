TITLE   :BUG: Using the Keyboard in SourceSafe Administrator May Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400bug kbSSafe500bug kbSSafe600bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Assigning user rights in the Visual SourceSafe Administrator does not work
correctly with the keyboard. Attempting to add project rights for a user by
choosing Rights by Project on the Tools menu will change the rights for the root
project only.

RESOLUTION
==========

The mouse must be used in place of the keyboard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start the Visual SourceSafe Administrator.

2. Select any user other than Guest and Admin.

3. From the Tools menu, choose Rights Assignments for User.

4. Choose the Add Assignment button.

5. Using only the keyboard, use the arrows to select a project.

6. Press the TAB key to move to the rights section. Assign any rights to the
   user.

7. Press the TAB key to move to the OK button, and press ENTER.

The Assignments for <username> dialog box shows that the rights for the
root ($/) project have been changed to the rights assigned in step 6. The same
behavior also occurs when from the Tools menu, you choose Rights by Project.
