SYMPTOMS
========

An application exception (trap) occurs in the SNA Server 802.2 Link Service when
you stop SNA Server version 2.11. If DRWTSN32.EXE is configured as the default
debugger, the DRWTSN32.LOG includes an exception similar to the following:

   Application exception occurred:
   App: snalink.DBG (pid=169)
   When: 08/2/1995 @ 1:54:25.364
   Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

In addition, SNA Server logs Event 624 in the Windows NT Event Viewer Application
Log when this trap occurs. The following is a detailed description of the Event
624 that is logged when the exception occurs:

Creating dump file C:\SNA\TRACES\SNADUMP.LOG for SNALINK.EXE

EXPLANATION:

A process (SNALINK.EXE) ended abnormally due to a protection violation or similar
condition and a dump file SNADUMP.LOG has been created that contains information
about the state of the process at the time of the exception. Register
information is contained in your Windows NT root directory in the file
DRWTSN32.LOG.

CAUSE
=====

The application exception is caused when the 802.2 Link Service tries to access
a pointer to a LCB after it has previously been freed.
