TITLE   :PPT7: Presentation Contains Blank Boxes If Saved as 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbdta kbconversion

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you save a PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 as a PowerPoint 3.0 or
4.0 presentation, two rectangles appear near the bottom of the slide. These
rectangles are located in approximately the same place as Headers and Footers in
the PowerPoint 7.0 version of the presentation.

These objects are visible only when you draw a selection box over them or when
you click Select All on the Edit menu.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is a side effect of the translation process. If a slide contains a
header or footer in these positions, the object is a text box containing the
text of the header and footer.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can delete these objects safely. Their presence does not harm the
presentation and their absence has no effect on the integrity of the
presentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PowerPoint 7.0 automatically places a page number field on every page when page
numbers are being used. These fields are translated as text boxes when the
presentation is saved in an earlier version format. Again, it is safe to edit or
remove these as necessary after translation to a PowerPoint 4.0 or 3.0 file.
