======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are viewing messages in a folder within the Sent Items folder in
Microsoft Exchange, the "To" column is missing. Instead, there is a "From"
column, which is always blank.

CAUSE
=====

By default, when you create a new folder in Microsoft Exchange, the following
columns are displayed in the folder:

   Importance
   Item Type
   Attachment
   From
   Subject
   Received
   Size

However, in the Sent Items folder, the "From" column is replaced with the "To"
column, in keeping with the folder's functionality. When you create a folder
within the Sent Items folder, the new folder uses the default columns listed
above, rather than the default columns for the Sent Items folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable a "To" column, follow these steps:

1. Click the folder in the Sent Items folder.

2. On the View menu, click Columns.

3. In the Show The Following Columns box, click "From," and then click Remove.

4. In the Available Columns box, click "To," and then click Add.

5. Click OK.
