SUMMARY
=======

There are times when a user may want to append a record when they get to the
last record in a grid. This can be accomplished programmatically by using the
BeforeRowColChange and the AfterRowColChange events as shown by example in this
article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

One important piece of the example is setting the buffer mode of the form to
either optimistic or pessimistic. This allows the GETFLDSTATE() function to
perform correctly. In addition, this sample code uses no index order on the
data.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Open the Forms Designer, and drop a grid on it.

2. Create a new property of the form called nLastRec.

3. In the Init event of the grid, place this code:

      GO BOTTOM
      ThisForm.nLastRec = RECNO()
      GO TOP

4. Place the following code in the BeforeRowColChange event.

      LPARAMETERS nColIndex   && This line is added automatically by FoxPro
                              && nColIndex is current column the cursor is in
      IF nColIndex = This.ColumnCount AND RECNO() = ThisForm.nLastRec ;
        AND LASTKEY() = 9
         APPEND BLANK
         ThisForm.nLastRec = RECNO()
         This.SetFocus
      ENDIF

   This code appends a record only if you press the TAB key to move through the
   fields. Code would have to be added for conditionally appending records based
   on different navigation through the fields.

5. Place the following code in the AfterRowColChange event:

      IF "3"$GETFLDSTATE(-1)
         This.ActivateCell(This.ActiveRow, nColIndex)
      ENDIF

6. Add code similar to the following to commit the changes to the table. This
   code can go into the Click event of a command button or in the Destroy event
   of the form.

      IF <condition to save>
         =TableUpdate(.T.)
      ELSE
         =TableRevert(.T.)
      ENDIF
