TITLE   :SMS Incorrectly Identifies Windows Clients as MS-DOS Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server client Setup incorrectly identifies a Windows
Workstation as an MS-DOS client. (The [SMS] section in the SMS.INI file
indicates "OS=1" for an MS-DOS client instead of "OS=2" for the Windows client.)

CAUSE
=====

There are two possible causes:

 - Systems Management Server Setup cannot find the WIN.COM file in the path.

   Setup cannot find WIN.COM in the PATH if the subdirectory for Windows is
   located to far down the path. For example, a system with the following path
   is detected as an MS-DOS client:

   PATH C:\;C:\DOS;C:\UTIL\PATH;C:\APPS\ORACLE;C:\APPS\PCTOOLS;C:\WFW311

   -or-

 - The Systems Management Server batch process runs out of environment space.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem (Do not change the SMS.INI file manually):

 - If your Windows directory is listed far down your path statement, move the
   Windows subdirectory closer to the beginning of the path statement. For
   example:

   PATH C:\;C:\DOS;C:\WFW311;C:\UTIL\PATH;C:\APPS\ORACLE;C:\APPS\PCTOOLS

   -or-

 - If the batch process is running out of environment space, place the following
   setting in the SYSTEM.INI of the Windows client:

         [NonWindowsApp]
         CommandEnvSize=1024

   Knowledge Base:

version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
