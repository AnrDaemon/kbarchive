The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The FoxPro 2.x Connectivity Kit allows you to send the results of the DBExec()
function to a table by using the DBSetOpt() function and setting the UseTable
property of the connection to 1. Visual FoxPro has no property that causes the
results of the SQLExec() function to be sent to a table.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The results of the SQLExec() function are always returned to a cursor. The
default cursor name is Sqlresult. To send the results to a table, use the COPY
TO command after calling the SQLExec() function. The COPY TO command creates a
table from the Sqlresult cursor.

The following example creates a table called Temp.dbf from the results of a
SQLExec() function. Create a new program containing the following code:

      datasrcname='test'    &&Data Source Name - from ODBC administrator
      userid='sa'           &&User ID
      pword=''              &&User Password

      ** Establish a connection **
      handle=SQLConnect(datasrcname, userid, pword)

      ** Execute query **
      =SQLExec(handle, 'select * from authors')

      ** Copy results to a table **
      COPY TO TEMP.DBF

      ** Close the cursor **
      SELECT Sqlresult
      USE

      ** End the connection **
      =SQLDisconnect(handle)

When this program is run, the results of the SQLEXEC() function are stored in the
Temp.dbf table.
