TITLE   :Using Socket Handle with Writefile() API Causes STOP Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAPI kbSDKPlatform kbWinsock kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a sockets program uses a socket handle with the Writefile() application
programming interface (API) for overlapped input/output (I/O), a STOP message
appears in Windows NT 3.51 after about 20 to 40 megabytes (MB) of data are
transferred.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs due to AFD.SYS using non-paged memory and not releasing the
memory.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the SETSOCKOPT function to set the send buffer
size (SO_SNDBUF option) to zero.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
