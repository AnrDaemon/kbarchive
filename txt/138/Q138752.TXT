======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), used with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, versions 2.x4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using a class or function template may incorrectly generate a C4114 warning. The
sample code in this article demonstrates a case where this occurs.

CAUSE
=====

The compiler incorrectly expands the type of the function parameter to const T
as it expands a template with type const T when the definition of a function or
member function template has a parameter that takes a const T.

The Help file gives the following information for C4114:

 - Same type qualifier used more than once.

 - A type qualifier (const, volatile, signed, or unsigned) was used more than
   once in the same type declaration or definition. The second occurrence of the
   qualifier was ignored. This is a warning when Microsoft extensions are
   enabled (/Ze) and an error when extensions are disabled (/Za).

 - The following is an example of this warning:

   

   volatile volatile int i;   // warning

RESOLUTION
==========

This warning can be safely ignored. To disable all occurrences of this warning,
use the #pragma warning preprocessor directive. The Help file demonstrates how
to use this pragma.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------------

      // test.cpp
      // Compile options needed - none
      template <class T>
      struct f
      {
        void goo( const T & r){ T t=r;};
      };

      void main()
      {
          f<const int> h;

          // the following line of code causes
          // goo( const const int ) to be expanded
          h.goo( 2 );
      }
