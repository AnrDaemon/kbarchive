TITLE   :PRB: Mapi Session Control and Exchange May Cause Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the MAPI Session Control that comes with Visual FoxPro 3.0 and Exchange
that comes with Windows 95 may result in the following error when you attempt to
log on:

   OLE Idispatch exception code 0 from MSMAPI32: Login has failed

The following error occurs if the LogonUI property is set to false (.F.):

   The profile name is incorrect.

This warning appears if anything other than the profile name is entered into the
Username property. The Password property is ignored.

CAUSE
=====

The Mapi.ocx file that ships with Visual FoxPro 3.0 is only compatible with
Microsoft Mail, not with Exchange. The Mapi.ocx file and Microsoft Mail use an
earlier version of MAPI, whereas Exchange uses MAPI version 1.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this incompatibility, do one of the following:

 - Have a session of Exchange currently running; then the error messages will
   not appear.

 - Place the profile name in the Username property. This avoids the warning
   message of "Invalid Profile name" and the Logon prompt for MS Exchange.

 - Use OLE Messaging by using OLE Automation to MAPI.

   For more information about using the OLE Messaging object, please see the
   September 1995 Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Level II CD-ROM compact
   disc, which contains the MAPI software development kit (SDK) and files
   necessary to get OLE Messaging to work with Visual FoxPro.



STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form, and add MAPI Session Control to the form.

2. Right-click the icon for the MAPI Session Control, and choose properties.

3. Clear the LogonUI check box, and select the NewSession check box.

4. Run the form. At this point, an error message appears.
