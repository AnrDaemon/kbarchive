TITLE   :PPT7: Slide Miniature Disappears If Dragged to Taskbar
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you drag the slide miniature window to the taskbar, it is difficult to select
the window to drag it back to the PowerPoint workspace.

CAUSE
=====

If you drag the slide miniature window to the taskbar, it actually goes behind
the taskbar. When you try to click it, you select the taskbar instead.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you close PowerPoint and restart it, the slide miniature window appears
within the PowerPoint workspace again.

You can also drag the Windows 95 taskbar to another edge of your screen. Then you
can select the slide miniature and move it.

Alternatively, you can configure the Windows 95 taskbar to Auto hide:

1. Right-click a blank area of the Taskbar, and then click Properties on the
   menu that appears.

2. Click to select the Auto hide check box.

3. Click OK.

Now the taskbar shrinks to a narrow bar and you can select your Slide Miniature.
