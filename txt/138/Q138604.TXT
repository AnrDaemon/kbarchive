======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the ALT+TAB key combination to cycle through active programs, the
order of the displayed programs is consistent with the most recently used
program being displayed first. However, if you minimize a program and then use
ALT+TAB to switch between programs, the minimized program appears at the end of
the switching order.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design to give priority to tasks that are not minimized.

Additional query words: 4.0
