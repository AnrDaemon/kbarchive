TITLE   :Duplicate Lan_Sender Entry in Sender Site Properties
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smssenders kbSMSSender

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


A second lan_sender entry for the site server appears in the Site Properties
Senders window when you try installing a lan_sender on another computer and the
install fails.

CAUSE
=====

If a lan_sender is installed on an invalid server, the sender defaults to the
site server. This causes another lan_sender entry for the site server to be put
in Sender Site Properties, even though there is still only one lan_sender
installed on the computer.

If you delete the second entry, all of the LAN_SENDER registry entries are set to
0 and you cannot add the lan_sender to the site server because it believes it is
already there.


RESOLUTION
==========

After the second entry appears in the Senders window, do not delete it. Modify,
add, or delete another sender to get rid of the second lan_sender entry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
