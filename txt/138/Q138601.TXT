SUMMARY
=======

At times, it may be necessary to run a form without displaying it. If the
Visible property of a form is set to False (.F.) at design time, the DO FORM
<form name> command will still display the form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the DO command is issued, an implicit This.Show is run and the form is
displayed. To run the form invisibly, add the following code to the Show method
of the form:

   IF THIS.VISIBLE = .f.
      NODEFAULT
   ENDIF

This code tells Visual FoxPro that the form should not do its normal Show routine
and to execute the code following the NODEFAULT clause.

NOTE: To make the form visible prior to releasing the form from memory, use the
NAME clause of the DO FORM command. For example, DO FORM test NAME myform could
be used and issuing myform.visible = .t. in the Command window would make the
form visible again.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. In the Command window, type:

      CREATE FORM TEST

2. Select the Property sheet, and change the Visible property to false (.F.).

3. Close and save the form.

4. In the Command window, type:

      DO FORM test

5. To make the form disappear, add the following code to the Show method of the
   form:

      IF THIS.VISIBLE = .f.
         NODEFAULT
      ENDIF
