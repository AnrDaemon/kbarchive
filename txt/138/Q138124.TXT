TITLE   :DHCPADMN.EXE Reports Incorrect Server Configuration
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install the DHCP Administrator Program (DHCPADMN.EXE) from the Windows NT
Server 3.51 compact disc, using the SETUP.BAT file in \CLIENTS\SRVTOOLS\WINNT
directory, you experience erratic results while administering remote DHCP
servers. Results from selecting a valid DHCP Scope may be one or more of the
following:

 - All configuration options are displayed.

 - No configuration options are displayed.

 - The correct configuration options are displayed.

The display problems do not happen when your computer is connected to all remote
DHCP servers, however, if the problem occurs with a particular remote server it
is persistent and always occurs with that same server.

Using DHCPADMN.EXE locally on the DHCP server displays the correct configuration.

CAUSE
=====

The DHCPSAPI.DLL file located in the following subdirectories of the Windows NT
Server 3.51 compact disc is corrupt:

   \CLIENTS\SRVTOOLS\WINNT\I386 \CLIENTS\SRVTOOLS\WINNT\MIPS
   \CLIENTS\SRVTOOLS\WINNT\ALPHA

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install the fix mentioned below.

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - From a computer of the same processor type that is running Windows NT 3.51
   DHCP without this problem, copy the %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\DHCPSAPI.DLL file
   to your SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32 directory. Make sure that this DHCPSAPI.DLL was
   not installed using the SETUP.BAT file mentioned above.

   -or-

 - Replace your corrupt DHCPSAPI.DLL with the uncorrupted file version on the
   Windows NT Server 3.51 compact disc in the \I386, \MIPS, and \ALPHA
   subdirectories:

 - Insert the Windows NT Server 3.51 compact disc into your CD-ROM drive.

 - In Windows NT File Manager, display the contents of one of the following
   subdirectories that corresponds to the processor on your computer:

   \I386
   \MIPS
   \ALPHA

 - Copy the DHCPSAPI.DL_ file to a temporary subdirectory on your hard drive.

 - Type the following command and press the Enter key:

   expand dhcpsapi.dl_ dhcpsapi.dll

 - Replace the %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\DHCPSAPI.DLL file on the local workstation
   with the DHCPSAPI.DLL you just expanded.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
