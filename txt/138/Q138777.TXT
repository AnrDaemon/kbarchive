SUMMARY
=======

Using the Query Designer and the Graph Wizard, a graph can be created in
Microsoft Graph from the results of a query. Once the graph has been created, it
is saved in a general field in a table. The generated graph can then be printed
or previewed by creating a report in the Visual FoxPro Report Designer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a report to print or preview a graph created in the Graph Wizard:

1. Save the graph created in the Graph Wizard. The Graph Wizard will give the
   table a default name of Vfpgraph.dbf.

2. Create a new report.

3. Add Vfpgraph.dbf to the report's data environment.

4. Drag the Olegraph field from the data environment to the detail band of the
   report.

5. Resize the object as desired.

6. Save and run the report.

The report should display the graph that was generated by the Graph Wizard.

Additional query words: VFoxWin
