KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you install SNA Server 2.11, SNA Server Setup incorrectly adds a second
COMNETMN entry to the registry even though the existing entry is the only entry
necessary for SNA Server link services to send link alerts to Netview, provided
a Netview connection is configured in SNA Server Admin.

The second COMNETMN entry is added to the Windows NT registry under the subtree
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE under the following subkey:

     SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/LanmanServer/Parameters/NullSessionPipes

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server Setup fails to check if the COMNETMN pipe name is already specified
in the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the update to SNA Server Setup mentioned below.


STATUS
