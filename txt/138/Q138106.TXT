TITLE   :PRB: Navigation Buttons Font Different from Other Object Fonts
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Wizard-generated form, the font used for the navigation buttons is
different from the font used for labels and other form objects.

CAUSE
=====

To maintain consistency with user expectations, the MS Sans Serif font was used
instead of Arial.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use Arial fonts exclusively on Wizard-generated forms, modify the Wizstyle
visual class library as found in the \Vfp\Wizards directory. Open the TxtBtns
class of the Wizstyle.vcx and change the FontName attribute for each
CommandButton object to Arial.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In 'Step 2 - Style' of designing a form using the Form Wizard, you are asked to
specify the style of the form. While all fields and other objects placed on the
form use the Arial font, the text buttons use the MS Sans Serif font.

NOTE: If the information in the "Resolution" section of this article is used, all
forms that use the TxtBtns class will reflect the changed font because of
Inheritance.
