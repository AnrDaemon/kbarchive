TITLE   :"Line Non-Operational" in Remote Access Service Monitor
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message appears in RAS Admin on your Windows NT Remote
Access Service (RAS) computer:

   Line Non-Operational

CAUSE
=====

When a connection is made to a RAS port, the RAS service searches for the next
available port. If a port is available, it queries the device to verify that its
status is OK. If an error is returned, the port is listed as "Line
Non-Operational" in RAS Monitor.

RESOLUTION
==========

This error can mean that the port itself is damaged or not set up correctly.

Alternatively, this error can mean:

 - You are running out of resources:

   If this is the case, disable some or all of the ports for outgoing calls and
   make them incoming lines only.


   -or-

 - The registry has the wrong information:

   To see if this is the case:

   1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

   2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

      \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Asyncmac\Parameters

      The Ports entry may be set to a value that is less than the number of
      incoming ports available. If NetBEUI is not loaded, this entry is not
      updated properly. If this is the case, first install NetBEUI, then
      configure RAS to use NetBEUI for dialin and restart.
