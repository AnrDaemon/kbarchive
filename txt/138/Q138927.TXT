TITLE   :Server Operators Unable to Format Server Hard Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.50, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On your computer running Windows NT, if you are a member of the Server Operators
group and attempt to format a fixed disk, the error Access Denied appears even
though the chart on page 398 of the Windows NT Server System Guide shows that
Server Operators have the ability to format a server's fixed disk.

CAUSE
=====

This is a documentation error in the Server System Guide.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ask your administrator to add your account to the Administrators group.

This allows you to format a fixed disk and to run diagnostic utilities such as
CHKDSK.EXE against the drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server versions 3.5
and 3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
