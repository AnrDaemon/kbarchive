TITLE   :MS Fax Does Not Recognize the "$" Calling Card Dialing Rule
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:kbtool win95 msnetwork

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to send a fax using Microsoft Fax configured to use the "Wait for
calling card prompt (bong)" or "$" dialing rule, the calling card and PIN
numbers may not be dialed.

CAUSE
=====

The "$" calling card dialing rule instructs the modem to wait and listen for a
tone (or "bong") generated by the phone company to activate the dialing of the
calling card and PIN numbers.

Microsoft Fax does not properly handle the "$" rule unless your modem is
specifically designed to handle the "bong."


RESOLUTION
==========

To cause the calling card and PIN numbers to be dialed when you send a fax with
Microsoft Fax, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon.

2. Click Dialing Properties.

3. Click Change to edit the properties for the calling card.

4. Click New, type a name for the custom calling card, and then click OK.

5. Click Advanced.

6. Click Copy From, click your calling card, and then click OK.

7. Edit the dialing rules. Replace all instances of "$" with four commas. You
   can adjust the number of commas as is appropriate for your modem.

8. Click OK or Close until you return to Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The modem driver normally translates the "$" into a series of commas for modems
that are not designed to handle the "bong," but Microsoft Fax bypasses the
portion of the modem driver that performs this translation.
