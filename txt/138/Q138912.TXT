TITLE   :Cannot Run Windows 95 Setup on Invisible Net Network
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows 95 Setup from a mapped network drive on an Invisible Net
network, you receive the following error message:

   You cannot check or repair drive <X>:

If you run Setup with the /IS switch to prevent ScanDisk from being run, you
receive the following error message:

   Setup could not create files on your startup drive and cannot set up Windows

CAUSE
=====

You cannot run Windows 95 Setup on an Invisible Net network because Invisible
Net maps local drives as network drives and Setup cannot be directed to a
network drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

To set up Windows 95 in an Invisible Net environment, follow these steps:

1. Copy all the Windows 95 Setup files to a local hard disk.

2. Disconnect the workstation from the network.

3. Run Setup without the /IS switch on the local drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use Windows 95 with Invisible Net (version 3.54) once Windows 95 has
been set up. However, you must use real-mode network drivers, and Invisible LAN
is the only network client available in Windows 95.

For additional information about Invisible Net or updated Invisible Net drivers,
please contact Invisible Software.
