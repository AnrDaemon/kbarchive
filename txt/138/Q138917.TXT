SUMMARY
=======

By using the Query Designer in Visual FoxPro, you can direct the output of the
query to an ASCII text file. This article will outline the steps necessary to
accomplish this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

1. Set up a query in the Query Designer.

2. On the Query menu, click Query Destination, and then click the Screen button.
   Click To Text File, and specify the output file name.

3. Clear the Pause Between Screens check box, and click OK.

4, Save and run the query. The output should be sent to the file specified in
step 2. Note that the output is also echoed to the screen. The following code
example can be used to suppress the output to the screen:

      DEFINE WINDOW win1 FROM 1,1 TO 5,5
      ACTIVATE WINDOW win1
      HIDE WINDOW win1
      DO QUERY1.QPR  &&replace QUERY1.QPR with your query name
      RELEASE WINDOW win1

When this code is run, the output of the query will be sent to the file specified
in step 2, and no output will be displayed on the screen.
