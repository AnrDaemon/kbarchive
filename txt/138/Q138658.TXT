TITLE   :PRB:Screen Turns Black & Returns as Start Visual FoxPro or Exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Visual FoxPro or a Visual FoxPro application executable (.exe)
file on a 16-bit operating system, the screen flashes black, as if going to an
MS-DOS session, and then it returns to Windows without starting Visual FoxPro or
the application. Or you receive this error message:

   This program cannot be run in DOS mode.

CAUSE
=====

The Win32s subsystem is missing or is not properly installed. On 16-bit Windows
platforms, such as Windows 3.1 or Windows for WorkGroups 3.11, the Win32s
subsystem in necessary for Visual FoxPro and Visual FoxPro application .exe
files to run.

RESOLUTION
==========

If Visual FoxPro won't start, you need to reinstall the Win32s subsystem. For
more information about how to reinstall the Win32s subsystem, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q129979 How to Reinstall Win32s with Visual FoxPro

If a Visual FoxPro application .exe file won't start, use one of the following
two possible resolutions:

 - If the Setup Wizard was not used to create distribution floppy disks for your
   executable, run the Setup Wizard to create a set of distribution disks disks
   or a netsetup directory for workstation installations. Then in "Step 2 -
   Optional Components" of the Setup Wizard, select Win32s as one of the
   optional components.

-or-

 - If the Setup Wizard was used to create distribution diskettes, rerun the
   Setup Wizard to rebuild the floppy disk images. Be sure to select Win32s as
   one of the optional components on "Step 2 - Optional Components."

NOTE: Windows 95 and Windows NT are 32-bit operating systems and do not require
the Win32s subsystem.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Build a Visual FoxPro executable (.exe) file.

2. Place the .exe file and Vfp300.esl files onto a computer running a 16-bit
   version of Windows that does not have a version of Win32s installed.

3. Attempt to run the executable.
