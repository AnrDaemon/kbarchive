SUMMARY
=======

Using CImageList::DeleteObject() results in compiler error C2039: 'DeleteObject'
: is not a member of 'CImageList'.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The documentation for Visual C++ versions 2.1 and 2.2 lists DeleteObject() as a
member function of class CImageList. This is not the case. The correct function
to use is DeleteImageList(). This function is documented in Visual C++ version
4.x, but it is not documented in version 2.1 or 2.2. Below is the documentation
for the function CImageList::DeleteImageList:

BOOL DeleteImageList( );

Return Value:

   Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.

Remarks:

   Call this function to delete an image list.
