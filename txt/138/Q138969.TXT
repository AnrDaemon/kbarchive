======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In a distributed application, you may need to allow users to modify report
layouts to fit their specific needs. While you can add this functionality,
unless specific steps are taken, it is possible that there will be no report
toolbars available. This article explains how to make the report toolbars
available from within a distributed application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two methods available to ensure that toolbars are available in your
application. The first requires the Foxuser resource file, and the second uses
menus and system menus.

Method One
----------

Toolbar state information is stored in the Foxuser resource file. Whenever a
report is modified or created in the design environment and the report toolbars
are open when that report is saved, the state of the toolbars is written to the
Foxuser file.

NOTE: The Toolbars submenu is not available until a report in actually open. If
you go to the View menu and try to select Toolbars, it is dimmed out if nothing
is open in modify mode.

When you use this method to ensure that report toolbars are available from within
the application, you must meet these conditions:

 - You must have modified or created a report in the design environment with one
   or both report toolbars open. You must then save the report. This will save
   the state of the report toolbars.

 - The Foxuser resource file must be distributed with your application.

 - The resource file must be either built into your application or marked as
   read-only. If it isn't, when the report is modified, the toolbars closed, and
   the report saved, the state of the toolbars will also be saved. As a result,
   because the toolbars are now closed, there is no direct way to re-open them
   from within your application. By marking the resource file read-only, if the
   user should close the toolbars, the resource file will not be updated with
   the new state of "closed."

Method Two
----------

A second and perhaps easier way to achieve the same result involves using the
Visual FoxPro System Menus. The following steps show how to do it:

1. In the Command window, type the following:

   CREATE MENU TESTMENU

2. Create the top-level menu option by entering the word "View" (without quotes)
   in the Prompt box. Change the Result drop-down to Submenu.

3. Click the Options button to the right of the menu you just created. A Prompt
   Options dialog box appears. In the box next to Pad Name, enter "_msm_view"
   (without quotes). Click OK to close the dialog box.

4. Click the Create button located to the right of the Submenu drop-down. Enter
   "Toolbars" (without quotes) for Prompt and change the Result drop-down to a
   value of Bar #.

5. Enter "_mvi_toolb" (without quotes) in the text box to the right of the
   Result drop-down.

6. On the main VFP menu bar, click View, and then click Menu Options. In the
   Menu Options dialog box, enter "_mview" (without quotes) for the menu name,
   and then click OK to close the dialog box.


When you compile the menu, you should have Toolbar functionality in your
application.
