TITLE   :SNA Server Reference Documents Registry Settings Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11,3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Appendix C of the SNA Server "Reference Guide" describes SNA Server registry
parameters that can be used to alter the default behavior of SNA Server. These
parameters are configured in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/SnaServr/Parameters

The Reference Guide describes these parameters as supporting "YES" and "NO"
values. However, when most of these parameters are added to this registry key,
the feature becomes enabled even though the registry value may be set to "NO".

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server service checks for the presence of these settings within the
registry to determine whether to enable them or not, even if the entry is set to
"NO". So, the Reference Guide incorrectly defines the method used to enable and
disable these settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the following entries are present in the SnaServr/Parameters key, they are
enabled, even if set to "NO":

   NOTERMSELF
   NORETRY
   ALLOWBBRQE
   NO4004
   NO400D
   NO2001
   CLEANUP
   ALLOCINACT
   NOINITCNOS
   NOPWDSUB

SNA Server 2.11 only:

   FNA_SUPPORT
   HNA_SUPPORT

To disable the above settings, the registry value should be removed and the SNA
Server service must be restarted.

If the following entries are set to "NO" (all caps), the entry is disabled. If
they are set to any other value, or are not present in the SnaServr/Parameters
registry key, they are enabled:

   RETRYCNOS
   RENEGLIMITS

If the following entry is set to "YES" (all caps), the entry is enabled. If it is
set to any other value or is not present in the registry key, it is disabled:

   NONOTIFYRSP

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0, 2.1,
2.11, 3.0, and 4.0.
