TITLE   :Windows NT 3.51 RAS Server Ignores Newly Added Serial Ports
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you allow Remote Access Service (RAS) clients to connect to the RAS server
after you add more physical serial ports and configure the RAS server service to
use these serial ports, the number of clients that can connect is still limited
to the original number of RAS ports and the following message appears in
RASADMIN for the added ports:

   Line Non-operational

This symptom occurs on a computer running RAS under Windows NT Server with only
the TCP/IP and NWLink protocol installed.


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the number of RAS serial ports in the registry is
not being updated when you add RAS serial ports in Control Panel.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, in Control Panel Network applet on the Windows NT
RAS server, install NetBEUI, remove and reinstall the Digiboard driver and RAS.

NOTE: When you install the NetBEUI protocol, the registry entries for the modem
ports are updated properly.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
