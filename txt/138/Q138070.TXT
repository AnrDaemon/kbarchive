SUMMARY
=======

The network protocol used between a client and a server during a Remote OLE
Automation Session depends on whether a prior connection still exists between
the two computers. Subsequent connections to that server depend on the protocol
used for establishing the first connection to that server, if this first client
makes a call to the server that returns another object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Client1 uses the TCP/IP protocol to connect to Server1 and calls a method on
an object1 (in Server1) that returns an object2, a new connection will be
established between client1 and object2 of Server1 that also uses TCP/IP. Now,
if a client2 connects to server1 using the IPX protocol and calls the same
method on object1 that returns it an object2, a new connection will be
established between client2 and object2 of Server1 that uses the TCP\IP
protocol, even though the original connection for client2 used IPX.

If the first connection between client1 and server1 is severed before a
connection is made with client2, the new client2 connection that is established
on returning object2 would now use the IPX protocol.
