TITLE   :XFOR: Err Msg: Unable to Deliver User Mail... Full Mailbag
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When sending mail from Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0, to a Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks user through the Microsoft Mail Connector, an error message
similar to the following is generated in the Microsoft Windows NT System Log (as
shown in the Event Viewer).

   A mail delivery problem has been detected on 35NET/35PO1.

   MESSAGE DATA:
   SOURCE MESSAGE ID: \\MailSrv\mailpo\35po1\MAI\MA8\000252B8.MAI
   FROM: 35NET/35PO2/Admin
   DATE: 08/14/95
   TIME: 17:36
   SUBJECT: Test Message
   [017] Unable to deliver user mail due to a full mailbag.
   Message was not delivered to Administrator (35NET/35PO1/Admin)

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message is generated when the Microsoft Mail Connector cannot write
the message record into the mailbag (.KEY and .MBG files) of the Microsoft Mail
recipient.

Microsoft Mail mailbags (.KEY and .MBG files) have a built-in limit of 4096
messages. In other words, if a mailbag contains 4096 read and unread messages,
no more messages can be added to that mailbag until one or more messages are
deleted from the mailbag.

When the Microsoft Mail Connector tries to deliver mail to a mailbag that already
contains 4096 read and unread messages, it generates the above error message in
the Event log.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are using Microsoft Mail client for Windows, logon to the mailbox in
question and download the messages into the your .MMF file. This copies all the
messages from the mailbag on the postoffice into your mail message file (.MMF)
and deletes the messages in the mailbag. Make sure that the option for inbox
synchronization is turned off.

If you are using the Microsoft Mail DOS client, logon to the mailbox and either
move the messages into a private or public folder, or delete them from the
inbox.

If you are using the Microsoft Mail Provider with Microsoft Exchange version 4.0,
Windows clients, logon to the postoffice. This automatically downloads mail from
your mailbag into your Microsoft Exchange Personal Information Store (.PST file)
and deletes the mail from the mailbag on the postoffice.
