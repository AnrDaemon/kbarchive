======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you drag-and-drop resources between two Resource Scripts and then try to
undo the drag-and-drop, Visual C++ terminates the action with an Application
Error (general protection (GP) fault). This happens only when you try to undo it
while the resource that was dragged and dropped is left open.

RESOLUTION
==========

Without opening the resource kit that was dragged and dropped select Undo.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open or create a resource script that contains at least one resource (for
   example, a Dialog resource).

2. Open or create another Resource Script. Drop the dialog resource into this
   file, and open it.

3. With this dialog resource open, shift the focus back to the first resource
   script file.

4. Select Undo the Drag-and-Drop. At this point, an application error appears.
