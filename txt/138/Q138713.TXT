TITLE   :Err Msg: Driver Entry Point Not Found After Service Pack Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to any one of the Windows NT 3.51 Service Packs (1 to 5) and
restart your computer, the following error message appears:

   System Process - Driver Entry Point Not Found popup The
   \SystemRoot\System32\drivers\srv.sys device driver could not locate the entry
   point RtllsNameLegalDOS8Dot3 in driver NTOSKRNL.EXE?.

The following system events appear in the Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 2508
   Source: Server
   Type: Error
   Description: The server service was unable to load the server driver.

   Event ID: 7023
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Type: Error
   Description: The Server service terminated with the following error:

   The system cannot find the file specified.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the Service Pack UPDATE.EXE program does not copy the new
NTOSKRNL.EXE file. When Windows NT 3.51 starts up after the Service Pack has
been installed, the Service Pack SRV.SYS and the Windows NT 3.51 (Build 1057)
NTOSKRNL.EXE are being used. These files do not work with each other.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one of the following:

 - Run the Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack UPDATE.EXE again.

   -or-

 - For a single processor system, copy the NTOSKRNL.EXE file from the Windows NT
   3.51 Service Pack to the %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32 directory.

 - For a multi-processor system, copy and rename the NTKRNLMP.EXE (multi-
   processor kernel) file from the Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack to the
   %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32 directory overwriting the NTOSKRNL.EXE.

NOTE: Some single processor RISC computers, for example, Sables, Demi- Sables,
Gamma, and the Alpha 2100, use a multiprocessor HAL and should use the
multiprocessor kernel.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
