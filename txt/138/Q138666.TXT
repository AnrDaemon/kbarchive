SUMMARY
=======

Browsing on demand works differently in Visual C++, versions 4.0 and later, from
previous versions. If you do not have browse information generated when you
attempt to use the browser in Visual C++ 4.0 and later, you get a message
stating that there is no browse information for the project. Then the project is
rebuilt accordingly to allow you to browse your project information.

One other option is to always build the individual source browser files (.sbr)
during your builds without generating the combined browser file (.bsc). Then run
Bscmake.exe as a tool from the Tools menu. This article describes the steps
required to do this.

================

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

1. On the Build menu, click Settings to bring up the Project Settings dialog
   box.

2. Select the desired target in the Settings For tree view.

3. Click the C/C++ tab, and select the Generate browse info check box. This will
   generate an .sbr file corresponding to each source file. Ensure that the
   "Build browse info file" check box in the Browse Info tab is cleared.

4. Click OK to accept.

5. On the Tools menu, click Customize to bring the Customize dialog box. Click
   the Tools tab. In Visual C++, version 4.0, click Add. In Visual C++, versions
   5.0 and 6.0, click the blank line at the bottom of the Menu Contents list and
   type &Bscmake.

6. Browse for the Bscmake.exe file. In Visual C++, versions 5.0 and 6.0, you can
   click the ellipsis beside the Command box to do this.

7. Fill in the fields for the tool as shown here:

   Field                Value
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   Menu text            &Bscmake
   Command              [Full path to BSCMAKE.EXE]\bscmake.exe
   Arguments            /o$(TargetName).bsc /n *.sbr
   Initial directory    $(TargetDir)

   NOTE: You can select the custom arguments like $(TargetName) from the menu
   provided on the right side of the edit box.

8. In Visual C++, version 4.0, select "Redirect to Output Window", and click
   Close, accepting this tool. In Visual C++, versions 5.0 and 6.0, select "Use
   Output Window".

NOTE: If you have been browsing the current .bsc file, you will have to close it
before building a new .bsc file. On the Tools menu, click Close Browse Info
File.
