TITLE   :BUG: VB 4.0 32-bit Quits When Deleting a Menu at Design Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenvkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After a specific series of menu manipulations with the Menu Editor and the
Properties window, deleting a menu and continuing with work causes VB32.EXE to
crash.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem occurs only with a very specific sequence of actions, and you can
easily work around it by avoiding the series of actions outlined in the "Steps
to Reproduce Problem" section of this article.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic.

2. Click the Menu Editor icon in the toolbar to bring up the Menu Editor.

3. In the Menu Editor dialog box, enter 'a' in the Name text box and 'a' in the
   Caption text box to create a single menu with no subitems. Click OK.

4. In the Properties window, select the menu that was just created.

5. Click anywhere in the non-client area of the form - the menu bar, title bar,
   or borders.

6. Click the Menu Editor icon again, and when the Menu Editor dialog box
   appears, delete the menu 'a' and click OK. The properties for the menu will
   stay visible in the Properties window, and the Name, Caption, and Shortcut
   properties will become gibberish. If you now attempt to add a new control,
   Visual Basic will quit.
