SUMMARY
=======

A text box on a form can display concatenated values from multiple fields. This
can be accomplished by putting an expression in the Refresh method of the text
box. Both the ControlSource and Value properties of the text box should be left
blank and the ReadOnly property should be set to True (.T.).

================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

To demonstrate how a text box can display concatenated values, follow these
steps:

1. Create a new form.

2. Add the Customer table to the Data Environment.

3. Using the form Controls toolbar, place a text box on the form.

4. In the text box Refresh method, type the following:

      This.Value = ALLTRIM(Customer.City) + ", " + ;
         ALLTRIM(Customer.Country)

5. Ensure that the text box ControlSource and Value properties are blank. Change
   the ReadOnly property to True (.T.).

6. Add a command button to the form, and place the following two lines in its
   Click event:

      SKIP
      THISFORM.Refresh

7. Run the form, and press the command button to observe the values in the text
   box.
