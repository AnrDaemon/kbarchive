======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The AppWizard, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Every project generated by AppWizard is automatically added to the Component
Gallery.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although this is by design, you may want to turn off the automatic insertion of
AppWizard-generated projects into Component Gallery. To do this, you must change
the setting of a registry key. The key is:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Developer\Gallery\ScanProjects

Setting this key to a value of 1 causes AppWizard-generated projects to be added
to the Component Gallery. A value of 0 disables this feature.

The Gallery\ScanProjects key does not exist by default. You must create it. To
add this key to the registry, do the following:

In Windows 95
-------------

1. Run Regedit by clicking Start on the Run menu.

2. Select the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Developer key.

3. Add the Gallery Key by on the Edit menu, clicking New and then clicking Key.

4. Select the Gallery Key, and add a DWORD value named ScanProjects by on the
   Edit menu, clicking New and then clicking DWORD.

5. Set the value of ScanProjects to the needed value. The value can be changed
   by double-clicking the value name or by selecting the name and on the Edit
   menu, clicking Modify. Set the value to one of these:

   0 - disable adding projects to component gallery
   1 - enable adding projects to component gallery

In Windows NT
-------------

1. Run Regedt32 by on the File menu clicking Run in Program Manager.

2. Select the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Developer key.

3. Add the Gallery Key. This key is created by on the Edit menu, clicking Add
   Key. The Class edit box should be blank.

4. Select the Gallery Key, and add a DWORD value named ScanProjects by on the
   Edit menu, clicking Add Value. The Data Type should be REG_DWORD.

5. Set the value of ScanProjects to 0 or 1 depending on the needed behavior. The
   value can be changed by double-clicking the value name or by selecting the
   name, and on the Edit menu, clicking DWORD. Set the value to one of these:

   0 - disable adding projects to component gallery
   1 - enable adding projects to component gallery
