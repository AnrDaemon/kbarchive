SUMMARY
=======

When the Form Wizard builds a form, it creates the form so that when the form
runs, the objects that hold data are disabled. Clicking the Edit button enables
the objects and allows editing of the information. However, if controls other
than check boxes, text boxes, or OLE-bound controls are added to the form, they
are enabled, not disabled, when the form is run.

This article shows you how to disable controls such as combo boxes and list boxes
so that they are disabled when the form runs and enabled when the Edit button is
clicked. The code that controls which objects are disabled or enabled is located
in the Wizstyle.vcx form. The combo and list boxes were not included in that
code, but you can modify the code to include the combo and list boxes.

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

1. On the File menu, click Open, and change Files of Type to Visual Class
   Library. In the \Vfp\Wizards\ directory, select Wizstyle.vcx. In the Open
   box, choose TXTBTNS as the Class Name. The Class Designer will appear and
   allow the editing of the wizard buttons.

2. Double-click any button. In the Object box, select TXTBTNS. In the Procedures
   box, select SETALLPROP. In this code, look for the following line (it is
   split here for readability):

      CASE ATC(m.oControlParent.Controls[m.i].BaseClass,
         "CheckBox,TextBox,OleBoundControl") # 0
             m.oControlParent.Controls[m.i].Enabled = THIS.EditMode

3. Note that CheckBox, TextBox, and OleBoundControl are the only objects
   referenced here. Add "ComboBox, ListBox, EditBox" to this line of code.

4. Save the changes, and create or open a wizard-generated form. Add a combo box
   based on a field from a table. When you run the form, note that the combo box
   is disabled until you click the Edit button.

By changing the code in the TXTBTNS class, this change will also effect the way
the picture buttons in PICBTNS behave on the combo and list boxes.
