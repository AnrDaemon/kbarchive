SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running any of the listed Windows versions, your computer may
occasionally stop responding (hang). This problem is known to occur on computers
with the following chipsets:

   OPTI-495SLC


CAUSE
=====

The Turbo Switch feature of your system ROM BIOS is enabled. This feature causes
the computer to monitor keyboard input for a particular series of keystrokes.
When this series of keystrokes is detected, the computer is placed in Turbo
mode.

Windows also queries the keyboard periodically. When the computer and Windows
attempt to query the keyboard at the same time, your computer may hang.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable the Turbo Switch feature of your system ROM BIOS. For information about
how to do so, contact your computer manufacturer.
