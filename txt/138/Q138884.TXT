You may want to print your Fine Artist document without a rectangular border.
Although Fine Artist doesn't provide a direct way to do this, this article
contains information on how you can print a document without a border.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To print your document without a rectangular border around the painting, use the
following steps:

1. Open the document you want to print.

2. Click the Print Toaster, and then click the toaster with McZee behind it.

3. When McZee welcomes you to his Printing Machine, click Next.

4. Click "Yes, I want to pick a background."

   NOTE: You must have the Fine Artist compact disc in your system's CD-ROM drive
   in order for the background option to appear.

5. Select a background from the background roll, and then click McZee on the
   right side of the screen to continue.

   NOTE: You can select any background because it doesn't print.

6. Make sure that there is a check on the "I have the paper" option and click
   Next.

7. Click one of the options for sizing your picture, and then click Next.

8. Verify that the number of copies you would like to print is correct, and then
   click Next.

9. When McZee indicates that he is ready to print, click Next to print your
   document.

Your painting should now print without a rectangular border.
