TITLE   :PRB: Form's Visible Property Does Not Respect Modal WindowType
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using <formobject>.visible to display a form having WindowType=1
(modal), the modal attributes are not applied to the form; you can click to move
off the form, and program execution continues.

CAUSE
=====

Setting the Visible property of the form does not apply modal attributes to the
form.

WORKAROUND
==========

Instead of using the Visible property of the form to display it, use the Show
method. The Show method properly applies modal attributes to the form.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Code Sample to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------------

     * The following example uses DEFINE CLASS and CREATEOBJECT()
      * to create two custom classes named FormChild and FormGrandChild from
      * the Visual FoxPro Form base class. ACLASS() is used to create an
      * array named gaNewarray containing the class names, which is
      * then displayed.

      CLEAR
      PUBLIC frmMyForm
      frmMyForm = CREATEOBJECT("FormGrandChild")
      frmMyForm.visible=.t.
      * frmMyForm.show     && uncomment this for proper behavior
      WAIT WINDOW 'After calling the form' TIMEOUT 2

      DEFINE CLASS FormChild AS FORM
      ENDDEFINE

      DEFINE CLASS FormGrandChild AS FormChild
             Caption='Hi'
             Left   = 10
             Top    = 10
             Height = 54
             Width  = 99
             WindowType = 1     && modal
             PROCEDURE Init
                      THIS.AddObject("Cmd1", "MyCmdBtn")
                      this.cmd1.left = (thisform.width - this.width) /2
                      this.cmd1.top = (thisform.height - this.height) /2
                      this.cmd1.visible = .t.
             ENDPROC
      ENDDEFINE

      DEFINE CLASS MyCmdBtn AS CommandButton
             Caption='Bye' && Caption on the Command button
             Left   = 10   && Command button column
             Top    = 10   && Command button row
             Height = 18   && Command button height
             Width  = 60   && Command button height
             PROCEDURE Click
                      THISFORM.Release
                      CLEAR EVENTS
             ENDPROC
      ENDDEFINE
