-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The Backup program included with Windows 95 cannot restore files that were
backed up with an earlier version of Backup (such as the versions of Backup
included with MS-DOS versions 5.0 and 6.x). To restore backups created with
earlier versions of Backup, you must use the Restore.exe or Msbackup.exe program
located on the Windows 95 CD-ROM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: Before you use the Restore.exe or Msbackup.exe program on the Windows 95
CD-ROM, please read the Lfnbk.txt file in the Admin\ Apptools\Lfnback folder on
the Windows 95 CD-ROM, or see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   Q120442 Using Hard Disk Utilities with Windows 95

Backups Made Using MS-DOS 5.0
-----------------------------

To restore a backup created with the Backup program included with MS-DOS 5.0, use
the Restore.exe program located in the Other\Oldmsdos folder on the Windows 95
CD-ROM. To run this program, copy it to a folder on your hard disk, and then run
it from a command prompt, making sure to use the appropriate syntax. For
information about the syntax for the Restore.exe program, type the following
line:

   " restore /? " (without the quotation marks)

If you receive the error message "Incorrect DOS version" when you try to run
Restore.exe, type the following line to modify the version table:

   " setver restore.exe 6.22 " (without the quotation marks)

After you type this line, restart your computer, and then try to run Restore.exe
again.

Backups Made Using MS-DOS 6.x
-----------------------------

To restore a backup created with the backup programs included with MS-DOS 6.x,
use the Msbackup.exe program located in the Other\Oldmsdos\Msbackup folder on
the Windows 95 CD-ROM. To run this program, copy all the files from the folder
on the Windows 95 CD-ROM to a folder on your hard disk. Double-click the
Msbackup.exe file in Windows Explorer to start it. For information about using
the Msbackup.exe program, start the program, and then click Restore on the Help
menu.
