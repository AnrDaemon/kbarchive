PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler

KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbMFC kbODBC kbVCkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, versions 2.0, 2.10, 2.20 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using a parameterized query that uses the LIKE keyword with the 2.0 ODBC
Desktop drivers, the following error message may appear:

   Syntax error in query expression.

CAUSE
=====

This is a result of a bug in the 2.0 Microsoft 32-bit ODBC Desktop drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only option when using the 2.0 desktop drivers is to use the LIKE keyword
without any parameterization. Instead of using the Requery() function, call the
Close() and Open() member functions of the CRecordset class to make the changes
in the query.

This bug is fixed in the 3.0 Microsoft ODBC Desktop drivers, so another option is
to upgrade from the 2.0 desktop drivers to the 3.0 desktop drivers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in the 32-bit Microsoft
ODBC Desktop Drivers version 3.0.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 2.20 3.00 3.10 3.20
