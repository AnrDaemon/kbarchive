KEYWORDS:diskmem win95 kbDiskMemory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

The performance of the file system on your computer is unchanged or degraded
after you select Network Server or Mobile Or Docking System in the Typical Role
Of This Machine box in the File System Properties dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

The NameCache and PathCache values are written to the registry incorrectly for
the Network Server and Mobile Or Docking System profiles. The data for NameCache
is written to the PathCache value, and the data for PathCache is written to the
NameCache value.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

Modify the NameCache and PathCache values in the following registry key:

   Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\FS
   Templates

NOTE: The value data for these settings is in hexadecimal format.

For the Mobile Or Docking System profile, use the following data:

   Value name   Value data
   ------------------------
   NameCache    51 01 00 00
   PathCache    10 00 00 00

For the Network Server profile, use the following data:

   Value name   Value data
   ------------------------
   NameCache    a9 0a 00 00
   PathCache    40 00 00 00

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 and
Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release version 1.

This problem has been corrected in Windows 95 OEM Service Release version 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you modify the registry settings, use the following procedure to optimize
your file system performance:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

2. On the Performance tab, click File System.

3. In the Typical Role Of This Machine box, click the most common role for your
   computer, and then click OK.

The default profile (Desktop Computer) does not use the NameCache or PathCache
values in the registry. Instead, the file system defaults are used.

NOTE: The profile values for NameCache and PathCache listed in the "Microsoft
Windows 95 Resource Kit" (page 566) are correct; however, they are listed in
decimal format. For the Desktop Computer profile, the default value for
NameCache is a5 02 00 00, and the default value for PathCache is 20 00 00 00.
