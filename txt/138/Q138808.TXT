TITLE   :PRB: "Error Writing Winspool.drv" During Visual FoxPro Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The error "Error Writing to Winspool.drv" appears while you are:

 - Setting up Visual FoxPro under Windows or Windows for WorkGroups.

-or-

 - Starting Visual FoxPro.

CAUSE
=====

The LaserMaster Print Manager was installed before you ran Setup. When Visual
FoxPro is installed under Windows or Windows for Workgroups, the Setup program
installs Win32s. The LaserMaster drivers interfere with installing Win32s
because the LaserMaster creates a WINSPOOL device. When the Setup program tries
to write to Winspool.drv, it fails because it tries to write to the WINSPOOL
device instead.

WORKAROUND
==========

Disable the WINSPOOL driver before installing Visual FoxPro. Once Visual FoxPro
and Win32s have been installed, you can reinstall the driver. You may need to
disable the driver at all times to run Visual FoxPro. However, this should not
prevent you from printing to the LaserMaster. To disable the driver, change the
following three lines to comments in the [386enh] section of the System.ini
file.

      device = lmharold.386
      device = lmmi
      device = lmcap

Then restart your computer before you install Visual FoxPro, so the changes take
effect.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
