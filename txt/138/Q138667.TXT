TITLE   :New Video Card Not Detected After Replacing Trident Card
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you remove a video card with a Trident chip set (which uses the standard
Super VGA driver provided with Windows 95) and add a video card compatible with
the standard Super VGA video driver, the Add New Hardware Wizard does not detect
the presence of the new video card and does not detect that the video card with
the Trident chip set has been removed.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 does not properly handle the response to the BIOS checksum it
performs on video cards with some Trident chip sets. Therefore, Windows 95
assumes the Trident card is still installed.


RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the Trident Super VGA driver in Device Manager, and then use the Add New
Hardware tool in Control Panel to manually add the proper display driver or have
the new video card detected automatically.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
