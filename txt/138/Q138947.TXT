TITLE   :FIX: Comma Acts Like CR/LF in Custom Build Options
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0,4.1,4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbide kbVC kbVC500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A comma used in the command line of the custom build options will be treated as
a CR/LF unless the string containing the comma is enclosed in double quotation
marks.

CAUSE
=====

Commas are used as delimiters internally.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Demonstrate Problem
----------------------------

1. Create or open a project.

2. Create a file that has an extension, such as Comma.p, that does not have
   built-in build rules. The content doesn't matter. Add this file to the
   project.

3. In build settings, select Comma.p, and click the Custom Build tab.

4. Put the following on the command line:

      cl -c -Tccomma.p -DCOMMA=',' -Dwhatever

5. Make Comma.obj the output file, and then click OK.

6. Return to the Build Settings dialog box, and notice that the custom build
   options have split into two lines:

      cl -c -Tccomma.p -DCOMMA='
      ' -Dwhatever

7. Replace the command with:

      cl -c -Tccomma.p -DCOMMA="','" -Dwhatever

8. Click OK, and then return to the Build Settings dialog box. The custom build
   options are now correct.
