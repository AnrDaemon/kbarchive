======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Grid is a container object that contains column objects. A column can contain
a header object and controls. Because a grid and its columns, headers, and
controls each have their own set of properties, you have complete control over
each element of the grid. When the view property setting in a grid is modified
to browse-change or change-change, the grid headers do not show, and the "ab"
symbols for the text box objects contained in the columns of the grid are cut
off. Not being able to see the fields in the grid prevents the designer from
designing a grid in the change mode.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

   symbols are cut off.
