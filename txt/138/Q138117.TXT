TITLE   :Err Msg: The Backup Set is Not Completely Cataloged
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you catalog a tape in Windows NT Backup (NTBACKUP.EXE), the following error
message appears:

   The backup set is not completely cataloged

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the catalog file on the hard disk contains incomplete
backup information.

When you catalog a tape in Windows NT Backup, a file is created that contains the
catalog information. The file name is the checksum of the backup set and the
extension is *.Uxx (where xx is the number of the backup tape used during a
backup session). As the system is cataloging the tape, Windows NT Backup creates
three TEMP files called QTC_TEMP.000, QTC_TEMP.001, and QTC_TEMP.002. Arcada
BackupExec for NT 6.0 functions the same way.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one of the following:

 - Close and restart Windows NT Backup.

   -or-

 - Locate a file with the .Uxx extension (where xx is the number of the backup
   tape used during a backup session) in the %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32 directory.
   Rename or delete the file and re-catalog the tape.
