LaserWriter II NTX printer driver, you receive a blank test page, followed by
PostScript error codes.

You may experience similar problems using NewGen PS Turbo 300, 380, and 400
models.

the printer by the manufacturer. For information about installing the drivers
included with your printer, please consult the printer's documentation.
