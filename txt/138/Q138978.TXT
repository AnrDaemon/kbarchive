TITLE   :PRB: Structure Contains Underscore When Running Crosstab
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Crosstab option in a query, special characters show up such as
an underscore character for the name of the field. Special characters specified
here are "~`!@#$%^&*()+{}[ ]\"':;?/>.<,". This only happens if the
special character is located in one of the fields of the table that is queried.

CAUSE
=====

The reason this happens is that the Query Builder cannot place a special
character in the structure of the query or table that is created when the query
is run. The only special character that is allowed in the structure of a query
or table is the underscore character. It takes the place of any of the other
special characters when the crosstab creates a new field from the contents of
the original field. For example, if a field in the table has a percent sign (%)
in it and nothing else, the name of the field in the query or table will be C_.
The C means character, and the underscore takes the place of the percent sign.
If the field contains any regular character plus a special character, such as
ABC#, the field name will be Abc_.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a table that consists of two character fields named Field1 and Field2.

2. Add three records containing this data:

   Field1    Field2
   ----------------
   Special   Data
   Special   Data
   Special   %

3. Create a query by using the Query Builder and add the two fields to the query
   in the Fields tab. Create a third field by using the COUNT()

      function located in the Functions/Expressions box. Set it up as
      COUNT(Field2). Note that the Cross Tabulate check box is not available
      until the third field is added. Be sure to select the Cross Tabulate
      check box when it becomes available.

4. Run the query, and look at the name of the third column of the Browse window.
   It should have the heading of C__.

5. Exit out of the Browse window, and select the original table (on the Window
   menu, click View Window). Then Click the Browse button, and change the field
   containing the percent sign (%) sign to ABC*.

6. Run the query, and note that the heading of the third field is Abc_.

All special characters are replaced with the underscore character in the
structure of the created query or table.
