boxes use the system font to display text.

To work around this problem, change your system font back to Small Fonts. To
change the fonts in Windows NT version 3.51, go into Control Panel Display and
change the Font Size to Small Fonts.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows NT Resource Kit
version 3.51. This problem was corrected and will be included in the next
release of the Windows NT Resource Kit.
