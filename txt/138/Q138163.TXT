TITLE   :PRB: Left Justify Puts a Space in Format Clause
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a numeric report expression is reopened after the Left Justify check box and
any other check box in the Format dialog are selected, a space is inserted
between the two format characters. The printed results of the expression in the
Report Designer will then be the format character and not the contents of the
field to be printed.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the Left Justify clause is used, the space will have to be deleted manually
each time the report expression is reopened.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Selecting the Left Justify check box in the Format dialog box of a numeric
report expression allows the expression contents to print aligned to the left.
(Make sure you use 9 or # format characters to suppress leading spaces.) If
another check box in the Format box is selected along with the Left Justify box,
the format clause is properly entered. However, when the report expression is
reopened, a blank space is placed between the Left Justify "B" format character
and the other format character. This results in the printing of the format
character instead of numeric value of the field.

Right-aligned character expressions may exhibit similar behavior. For more
information about this, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q134308 Upper Format Truncates Right/Center Alligned Report Field

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a table that contains a numeric field, and create a report containing
   the numeric field.

2. Double-click the numeric field, and then click the button next to Format box.

3. Select the Left Justify check box and any one of the other check boxes.

4. Close the Format box, and preview the report. Note that the preview of the
   numeric field is correct.

5. Close the preview, and double-click the numeric expression in the Report
   Designer. Note that there is now a space between the B format character and
   the additional format character. Close the Report Expression dialog box, and
   preview the report. You will see the format character instead of the numeric
   field contents.
