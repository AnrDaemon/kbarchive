CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Monotype Sorts TrueType font has been installed
and is damaged. This font is not included with Windows 95, and is not necessary
for the fonts listed above to work correctly. However, if this font is installed
and is damaged, the fonts listed above may be affected.


RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the Monotype Sorts font from the Fonts folder, and then restart your
computer. To remove the Monotype Sorts font, double-click the Fonts icon in
Control Panel, use the right mouse button to click the Monotype Sorts icon, and
then click Delete on the menu that appears.

To restore the Monotype Sorts font, reinstall the program that originally
installed the font. Depending on the program, you may also be able to copy,
expand, or extract the font files directly from the program's CD-ROM or disks.
For information about how to do so, refer to the program's documentation or
manufacturer.
