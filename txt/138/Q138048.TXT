TITLE   :Server Name Not Displayed in Login Dialog Box
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (NDS),
if you log in to a bindery server using the Advanced button in the Login dialog
box, and then click "Close all programs and log on as a different user" in the
Shut Down dialog box, the Login dialog box states:

   You are logging into the server named. You will not have access to
   your directory tree.

The server name in the dialog box is blank. If you enter your password and click
Continue, you receive the following error message:

   You are not logged in to the server. The server name you specified is not
   valid or the server is not available.

CAUSE
=====

This area of the Login dialog box is based on the Preferred Server entry in the
properties for the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks. If this entry is
blank, the problem described above occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - In the Login dialog box, click Advanced, click "Log in to a bindery server,"
   and enter the name of the correct server.

 - Add a preferred server on the General tab in the properties for the Microsoft
   Client for NetWare Networks.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
