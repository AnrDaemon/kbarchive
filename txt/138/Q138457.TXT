TITLE   :DOC: PUTFILE() Help Topic Says DialogCaption Is at the Top
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.6a; WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocfix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Help topic for PUTFILE() describes the parameters that the function can
accept. The Help topic describes the first parameter, cDialogCaption, with the
following text:

   Specifies the caption displayed at the top of the Save As dialog box.

If Visual FoxPro is running under an operating system such as Windows 95 or
Windows NT that uses Comdlg32.dll, the description (physical location) of the
Dialog Caption is incorrect.

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When PUTFILE() calls Comdlg32.dll, the physical location of the string affected
by the first parameter in PUTFILE() is not at the top of the dialog box produced
by Comdlg32.dll as it is in Windows version 3.x and as it is described in the
Help file. Instead, it is in the lower-left corner of the dialog box produced by
Comdlg32.dll and by default contains a "File name:" string.
