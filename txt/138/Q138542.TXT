When you use RAS to make a dial-up connection, the Authentication Retry
dialog box used in Remote access Service (RAS) does not appear if the
credentials (user name, password) of the locally logged on user are the
same as the user account for the domain the client is dialing into. This
occurs regardless of the name of the local workgroup or domain.

If the "authenticate using current user name and password" dialog box is
disabled under the RAS Phonebook, and you leave the Username, Password and
Domain boxes blank, RAS still compares the access token of the currently
logged on user with the account enabled under RAS Administrator on the RAS
server. The credentials that are checked are the username and password, but
not the domain (or workgroup). If the user credentials are the same, but
the domain or workgroup is different, you are authenticated and the
authentication retry dialog box is not be displayed.
