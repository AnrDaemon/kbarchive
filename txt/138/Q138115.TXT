TITLE   :Error 1811 Occurs Running JETPACK.EXE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the JETPACK utility to compact a Windows Internet Name Service
(WINS) or DHCP database, the following error message appears:

   Jetpack failed with error = -1811

CAUSE
=====

Error 1811 is a JETPACK error which means "File not Found."

This problem occurs if you run JETPACK.EXE from a directory other than the WINS
or DHCP directory. This error will occur even if the correct directory path for
the WINS/DHCP database file is given. This is because JETPACK.EXE expects the
SYSTEM.MDB file to be present in the current directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Run JETPACK.EXE from the WINS or DHCP directory.

   -or-

 - Copy the WINS/DHCP database file, SYSTEM.MDB to the current directory and run
   JETPACK giving the full path of the WINS/DHCP database file.

   NOTE: Windows NT 4.0 does not use the System.mdb file, so it is not necessary
   to copy this file in Windows NT 4.0.

   -or-

 - Rename the J50.LOG file to another name and rerun jetpack.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server versions 3.5,
3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
