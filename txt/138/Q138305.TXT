The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SUMMARY
=======

If you create multiple hardware profiles on your computer, Windows 95 attempts
to automatically detect the hardware profile that should be used by examining
the hardware that is currently installed. If Windows 95 cannot determine the
hardware profile that should be used, you are prompted to select a hardware
profile. You cannot configure Windows 95 to use a default value at this prompt;
you must select a profile for Windows 95 to start.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The hardware profile detection routine combines interrupt checksums, serial and
parallel port data, computer identification data from the system ROM BIOS, and
other information to create a unique identifier for the current hardware
configuration. Windows 95 then compares this value with the values for the
hardware profiles that you have created.

If the current hardware configuration matches only one hardware profile, that
profile is used automatically. If the current configuration matches more than
one profile, you are prompted to select a hardware profile, or to create a new
hardware profile. If the current configuration matches none of the current
profiles, a new profile is created and you are prompted to enter a name for the
new profile. You cannot configure Windows 95 to use a default value at this
prompt.

If you are using an MS-DOS multiple configuration menu, the menu may not appear
when you start your computer. Once a hardware profile has been selected (either
automatically by Windows 95 or manually by you), Windows 95 attempts to match
the profile with one of the MS-DOS configurations in the Config.sys file. If the
name of the hardware profile matches the name of one of the MS-DOS
configurations, that configuration is selected automatically and the multiple
configuration menu does not appear. If the name of the profile does not match
the name of one of the MS-DOS configurations, the multiple configuration menu is
displayed and you are prompted to select one of the configurations. This prompt
can be configured to use a default value using the "Menudefault=" line in the
Config.sys file.
