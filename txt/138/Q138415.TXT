SYMPTOMS
========

When you run below 10% (default setting) free disk space on any of your hard
drives on your computer running Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT fails to notify you
with Event 2013 "The C: disk is at or near capacity. You may need to delete some
files".

CAUSE

The Windows NT 3.51 SRV.SYS driver drive name calculation algorithm is
incorrect, which causes it not to check periodically for the amount of remaining
free disk space.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.
