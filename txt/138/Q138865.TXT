SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Menu Editor to add top-level menu items without adding any
drop-down items, and you save or close the resource, upon opening the Menu
Resource again, the Resource Editor displays the top-level menu items as pop-up
menus.

Right-click and clear the View As Popup check box. This will display the
top-level menus horizontally.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
