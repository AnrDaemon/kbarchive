TITLE   :Directory Synchronization May Fail with Windows NT 3.51 Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Persistent failures of directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) with Windows NT Mail
(MSMAIL32.EXE) may record the following in the DIRSYNC.LOG file:

   Fatal [203] GAL Rebuild problem accessing files Global Address List not
   installed on this Postoffice

CAUSE
=====

The GAL.NME file is being held open (but not locked) by the MSSFS32.DLL file.
MSSFS32.DLL is used to resolve the names of intended recipients. When an
intended recipient is an external user with a name already in the Personal
Address Book (PAB), the GAL.NME file is not closed after the message is sent.
The server does not allow REBUILD.EXE to delete the old GAL.NME, generating the
error.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - From the Mail menu, select Options and clear the Add Recipients To Personal
   Address Book check box

   -or-

 - Make sure every workstation performs an Exit And Sign Out from Windows NT
   3.51 Mail before you run REBUILD.EXE.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
