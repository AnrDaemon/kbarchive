TITLE   :NBIPX: Broadcast Datagrams Should Contain Destination Field
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.50,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.50, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.50, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Interoperability problems occur when existing Windows NT computers send or
receive broadcast datagrams. Directed datagrams (or group datagrams) are not
affected.

A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should
be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the service pack release containing this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information. 1, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, or
Windows 95 client, the client receives 45 bytes (16 bytes extra). When the
packet is issued from a Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 or a Windows 95
computer to a Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 computer, the Windows NT computer receives
13 bytes (16 bytes lost).

CAUSE
=====

The broadcast datagrams do not contain the destination name field in the NBIPX
portion, therefore the data starts immediately after the source name.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install the fix mentioned below.

Broadcast datagrams (0xC) contain the destination field, even though it is
ignored by the receiver.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and A
supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should be
applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. This problem was
corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT Workstation or Server
version 3.51. For information on obtaining this update, query on the following
