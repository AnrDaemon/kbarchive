   Instructions for using updated Visual FoxPro for Windows Foxmapi.fll and
   Foxmap16.dll files
**************************************************************************

Running Vfpmapi.exe creates the following files:

   Readme.txt   - Instructions and Limitations of Use
   Foxmapi.fll  - DLL interface to Mapi.dll and Splus.dll
   Foxmap16.dll - Thunking layer for use on 16-bit operating systems
   Foxmapi.hlp  - Help file on the use of functions in FOXMAPI

Instructions
------------

Place both the .fll and .dll files in your application directory. If your
application will only be used on 32-bit operating systems, Foxmap16.dll is
not required.

To load Foxmapi.fll in your program, use this command:

   SET LIBRARY TO foxmapi ADDITIVE

All functions provided in the Foxmapi.fll are now available.

Limitations of Use
------------------

The following restrictions are necessary for FOXMAPI to function correctly:

 - FOXMAPI will only interface to Microsoft Mail, version 3.2 (both 16- and
   32-bit). FOXMAPI cannot be used as an interface to Microsoft Exchange,
   provided with Windows 95.

 - FOXMAPI cannot interface with Microsoft Mail version 3.2 or Schedule+
   version 1.x under Windows 95.

 - Testing is not yet complete to determine whether FOXMAPI can interface
   successfully to 32-bit Schedule Plus available with Windows NT.
