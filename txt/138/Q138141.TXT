SUMMARY
=======

A client's request for any service from a remote server always goes through the
Automation Manager (AM) that runs on the server computer. If this request cannot
be granted by the AM for some reason (for example, if the server is busy), then
after some timeout interval an entry will made in an eventlog by the AM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On Windows NT version 3.51, 4.0, and Windows 2000 the event log is a system file
that can be viewed by running the system utility called EventViewer
(Eventvwr.exe) in the Administrative Tools Program Group in the Program
Manager.

On Windows 95 or Windows 98, there is no system event log file. So, the AM
creates a similar file AUTMGR32.log. It is created in the windows\system or
win95\system directory and it is used when making the error entries. This is a
standard text file and can be opened in any text editor like Notepad. This file
cannot exceed a certain maximum size. There are entries in the system registry
that have values that the AM uses to see when the maximum size of this log file
is reached, so that it can truncate its size to another value also obtained from
the registry. These registry keys are:

   MinErrorLogSize DWORD (size to truncate to in bytes)
   MaxErrorLogSize DWORD (threshold of when to truncate in bytes)

NOTE: Only the AM can make entries in the eventlog. If the server raises an
error, it is just passed on to the client and no eventlog entry is made.
