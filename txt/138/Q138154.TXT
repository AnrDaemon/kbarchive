======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the MS-DOS FOR command in Windows 95, long filenames (LFNs) may not
be handled correctly in MS-DOS sessions or with LAN Manager version 2.11
servers.

CAUSE
=====

When you use the FOR command in Windows 95, LFN support is turned off. This
behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the "LFNFOR ON" command before you execute a FOR command in a batch file.

For example, the following batch file displays all LFNs on the screen:

   @echo off
   lfnfor on
   for %%I in (*.*) do echo %%I

In this example, the "LFNFOR ON" command causes LFNs to be displayed correctly. A
file named "New Text Document.txt" is displayed with its full name. Without the
"LFNFOR ON" command, the file would be displayed with its 8.3 filename of
"Newtex~1.txt."

MORE INFORMATION
================

The LFNFOR command enables and disables LFN support when processing FOR
commands. Use "LFNFOR ON" to enable LFN support, and "LFNFOR OFF" to disable LFN
support.

Type "lfnfor" without a parameter to display the current setting. The default
value is LFNFOR OFF.
