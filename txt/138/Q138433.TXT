TITLE   :PRB: Unable to Open <path Name> When Running Analyze
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running Analyze with the path to the data directory produces the following error
if the path contains a directory name that has an extension:

   Unable to open <Path to Data directory>

CAUSE
=====

Analyze can not resolve the path to the data directory if any of the directory
entries have a period (.). You can move the Analyze program beyond the directory
with the extension, and use a relative path. This does not occur in Visual
SourceSafe version 4.0

RESOLUTION
==========

Move Analyze so that you can call it with a relative path to the data
directory.

-or-

Rename the directory so that it does not contain a period.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a directory that has an extension (for example, Mydir.tst).

2. Move or copy the SourceSafe data directory into the directory you created in
   step 1.

3. Run Analyze from the SourcSafe Admin directory, supplying a complete path to
   the data directory as in this example:

   Analyze C:\Mydir.tst\Data

   At this point, Analyze responds with this error:

   Unable to open: C:\Mydir.tst\Data"
