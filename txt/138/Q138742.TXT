======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks, any active network
drives mapped to NetWare servers may be lost when you suspend your computer and
then resume from suspended mode. If you are using the Microsoft Client for
Microsoft Networks, mapped drives are not lost.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks does not retain NetWare drive mappings
when you suspend the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - If you manually mapped the network drives, map them again.

 - If the drives were mapped in a login script, you can restore them by
   processing the login script again. To do so, click the Start button, click
   Shut Down, and then click "Close all programs and log on as a different
   user."
