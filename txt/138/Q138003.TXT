TITLE   :PC Forms: Err Msg: ...No E-forms Available in Shared Mail...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Electronic Forms Designer has been installed in a shared Microsoft Windows
installation, and the Novell NetWare Map ROOT command has been used to map the
Windows directory, MEFBROWSE.EXE will not find the existing E- forms and gives
the following error:

   There are no e-forms available in the shared Mail extensions directory, or
   installed on your machine.

CAUSE
=====

This is due to the result returned from the GetWindowsDirectory() function that
may or may not return the trailing backslash in the path to the Windows
directory. If the Windows directory is the root of the drive, or Novell's Map
Root has been used, then the function returns a trailing backslash.

In all other cases, the path returned does not include a trailing backslash. This
creates a problem when the MEFBrowse code appends a backslash to the returned
path because, in some cases, the path is invalid due to having two backslashes.
As a result, Browser fails to locate your MSMAIL.INI.

RESOLUTION
==========

To verify the cause of this problem remap the Windows directory so that it is
not the root of a drive. Then change to the Windows directory, and run Windows.
See if Browser returns the error above.

You can also modify the code of MEFBROWS.EXE by making the following changes to
the BROWSER.FRM file, and recompile the VB project.

In the BROWSER.FRM object Form:

1. Remove the following line:

         szMSMailIni = Trim$(Left$(szWinDir$, cbRet) & "\" & LOCAL_INI)

2. Replace the above line with the following lines:

         predir$ = Trim$(Left$(szWinDir$, cbRet))
         If Right$(predir$,1) = "\" Then
             szMSMailIni = predir$ & LOCAL_INI
         Else
             szMSMailIni = predir$ & "\" & LOCAL_INI
         EndIF

3. Save the project, and recompile the EXE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of Microsoft
Electronic Forms Designer. We are researching the problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
