PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Shadowed text may be printed without shadows when you print your presentation to
a black and white printer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because in PowerPoint you can specify a black and white
view for PowerPoint objects. By default, all objects are set to Automatic for
text objects. By selecting the Automatic option, black text is printed without
shadows.

RESOLUTION
==========

To ensure that your shadowed text objects print with shadows, select the
Grayscale option for the object's black and white view.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To customize the black and white behavior for an object:

1. On the View menu, click Black And White.

2. Select the object you want to customize.

3. Right-click the object, and then click Black And White on the menu that
   appears.

You now see the list of black and white options for this object.

NOTE: Some printers cannot print text in any color other than black. If you use
one of these printers, shadowed text prints as doubled black text.
