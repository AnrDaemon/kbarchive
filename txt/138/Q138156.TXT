PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to set up the following programs from a CD-ROM, the Make Program
Accessible Under Windows option does not work:

 - Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego

 - Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego

 - Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program for these programs checks the System.ini file for the
"SHELL=PROGMAN.EXE" line when you use the Make Program Accessible Under Windows
option. In Windows 95, this line has changed to "SHELL=EXPLORER.EXE," causing
the Setup program to fail.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use the Make Program Accessible Under Windows option. After you install
one of these programs, run it by double-clicking it in Windows Explorer or My
Computer, or from an MS-DOS prompt.
