TITLE   :Win95 Error Message: Error: 0003 Setting the Registry File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msnets win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Setmdir command, you may receive the the following error
message:

   Error: 0003 Setting the Registry File.
   An error occurred booting this server based workstation.
   You will need to contact the system administrator for help.

CAUSE
=====

The Setmdir command is not correctly reading the mapping line after the
sysdatpath line in the Machines.ini file.

RESOLUTION
==========

A normal Machines.ini entry would look something like:

   [000000000000]
   sysdatpath=h:\user1
   h=\\server\share\dir1

Reverse the order of the lines in the Machines.ini file, so that the entry reads
as follows:

   [000000000000]
   h=\\server\share\dir1
   sysdatpath=h:\user1

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
