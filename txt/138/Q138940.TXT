TITLE   :Windows 95 Hangs with Ibmtok.dos Network Adapter Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your computer, your computer may stop responding (hang) or pause
for from 45 seconds to 1.5 minutes after the NET START command in the
Autoexec.bat file is processed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if a real-mode protocol is installed and you are using
the NDIS2 version of the network adapter driver (Ibmtok.dos) for an IBM Token
Ring network adapter.

The Ibmtok.dos driver installed by default in Windows 95 does not function
correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the updated IBM Token Ring adapter driver. To do so, follow these
steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.

2. Click Add, click Adapter, and then click Add.

3. Click Have Disk.

4. In the Copy Manufacturer's Files From box, enter the following line, and then
   click OK

   <drive>:\drivers\network\ibm

   where <drive> is the CD-ROM drive containing the Windows 95 CD-ROM.

NOTE: There may be two installed network adapters after you perform these steps.
Remove either adapter from the list of adapters. Both adapters refer to the same
driver.

If you do not have the CD-ROM version of Windows 95, you can obtain the A464.exe
file from the following Microsoft File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Services/whql/drivers/win95/netlan/

Obtain the A464.exe file from the Microsoft FTP site, double-click the A464.exe
file to extract the files it contains, and then follow the steps above. In step
4, replace "<drive>:\drivers\network\ibm" with the folder containing the
files you downloaded and extracted.
