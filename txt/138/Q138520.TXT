SUMMARY
=======

Adding an ampersand (&) character to the end of a Hexadecimal number will
ensure that it is not sign extended. This can be useful when an unsigned
constant must be passed to a routine and the magnitude of the constant is
greater than or equal to 32,768 (&H8000 in Hexadecimal). If the ampersand is
not placed on the end of the constants, Visual Basic assumes that the numbers
are sign extended.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example illustrates the effect of an ampersand on a Hexadecimal
constant:

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. In the default form (Form1), place the
   following code in the Click event for the form:

         Private Sub Form_Click()
            Dim j As Long
            j = &H8000
            Debug.Print j
            j = &H8000&
            Debug.Print j
         End Sub

2. Run the code by pressing the F5 key. The Debug window shows the output as
   -32,768 followed by 32,768 indicating that the ampersand does suppress the
   sign.
