TITLE   :HOWTO: Backing Up Visual FoxPro Setup Disks
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to make a backup copy of a set of installation disks
prior to installing Visual FoxPro. With the exception of Disk 1, Visual FoxPro
disks use a format called DMF (Distribution Media Format). DMF increases the
capacity of a 3.5-inch disk to approximately 1.7MB, thus reducing the number of
disks needed to install Visual FoxPro. Because of this new format, DMF-formatted
disks cannot be copied using the MS-DOS DISKCOPY command, or any other
conventional method of copying floppy disks. However, the contents of the disks
can be transferred to another storage device, such as a local hard disk, and
then backed-up using tape backup or similar software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Instructions for transferring files from the DMF formatted floppy disks to a
local hard drive are included in the Readme.hlp file located on Visual FoxPro
Disk 1. The section titled "Installing Visual FoxPro from 3.5-inch Disks"
discusses how to transfer the files from floppy disk to hard disk.

NOTE: There is an error in the syntax of the FOR command in the Readme.hlp file.
This is how the FOR command appears in the README.HLP file:

      FOR %I IN (*.*) DO C:\DISKS\EXTRACT /C A:\%I C:\DISKS\%I

The correct syntax for the command is:

      FOR %I IN (A:\*.*) DO C:\DISKS\EXTRACT /C %I C:\DISKS

Once the files have been transferred, they can be backed up by using any standard
backup utility.

Disk 1.
