PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet msnets win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run an executable file from a LAN Manager for Unix (LMX) version
1.44 server, you may receive an "Access denied" error message, even though you
have the correct permissions to access the file.

CAUSE
=====

Some LMX configurations allow files to be opened for Execute access without
allowing Read access. If a Windows 95 client opens such a file to run it, the
server denies subsequent read requests. You must be able to read the file in
order to run it.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue is resolved by the following updated file(s) for Windows 95, and
later versions of these file(s):

   VREDIR.VXD  version 4.00.953  dated 9/13/95  140,367 bytes
