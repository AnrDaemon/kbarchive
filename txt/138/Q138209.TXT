Patch Fix Text and File

Encarta 96 Encyclopedia
-----------------------

This directory contains files used with the Microsoft Encarta 96 Encyclopedia
CD-ROM. The following files are in this directory:

 - Enc96fix.exe: This file fixes a problem with non- appearing article updates.

   For more information, see enc96fix.exe, below.

 - Sep95a.eyb: This file is the September 1995 yearbook builder update for the
   Encarta 96 Encyclopedia.

 - Readme.doc: This file contains troubleshooting and downloading information.

 - Readme.txt: An ASCII version of this file.

 - Enc96fix.exe

Read this section if you are running Windows 95 and you chose Slower Execution
during setup.

This file corrects a problem with the Windows 95 registry that occurs when you
select the slower execution option when setting up Encarta 96 Encyclopedia.
(This problem does not occur with the faster execution option.) The result of
the registry problem is that the Yearbook Builder article updates cannot be seen
in the Yearbook Builder browser, and

the icon that indicates that an article has been updated does not appear.

To test for and repair the registry problem:

1. In Encarta 96 Encyclopedia, click on Find and open the article on Yugoslavia.
   For more information about using Pinpointer to search for articles, see
   online Help.

2. Examine the article's title bar, the black bar that contains the word
   "Yugoslavia."

   If the title bar has a yellow yearbook icon at its right- hand side, and you
   can click on that icon to bring up an update called "The Shameful Ending of
   Yugoslavia," then your encyclopedia is installed correctly and you don't need
   to proceed to step three.

   If the title bar doesn't have a yearbook icon at its right-hand side, then
   proceed to step three.

3. Download and run enc96fix.exe. Your encyclopedia is repaired.
