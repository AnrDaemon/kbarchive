TITLE   :PRB: No Visual Clue to Number of Lines Edit or Text Box Holds
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you work with a text or edit box on a form, there are no visual clues in
Visual FoxPro that indicate how many lines of text will actually be displayed.
In FoxPro version 2.6, lines appear that give an indication of how many lines of
text will be displayed in these two objects.

WORKAROUND
==========

The default scale mode for Visual FoxPro is pixels. To specify an approximate
number of lines to be displayed in these objects:

1. Set the form ScaleMode property to Foxels.

2. Select the object.

3. Change the value of the object's Height property (in the Properties sheet
   under the Layout tab) to the number of lines of text you want to display in
   the object.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The font such as MS San Serif, the font size, and font attributes can all affect
the actual number of lines of text displayed.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Command window, enter these commands:

      SET DEFAULT TO SYS(2004)+"\SAMPLES\DATA"
      OPEN DATA testdata
      CREATE FORM myform

2. On View menu, click Data Environment to open the data environment. Then on
   the DataEnvironment menu, click Add. In the Add dialog box, choose the
   Employee table, and click OK.

3. Select the Notes field in the Employee table, and drag it from the Data
   Environment onto the form to create an edit box. Adjust the size to display
   several lines of text.

4. With the form selected, click Properties on the View menu, and make sure
   Form1 is selected. Under the Layout tab, set the ScaleMode to Foxels.

5. Choose the Edit1 object. Under the Layout tab, set the following properties:

   Height    3.5
   FontName  Arial
   FontBold  .T.
   FontSize  10

6. Under the Data tab, set the ControlSource to employee.notes.

7. Run the form.

Although you've specified a height of 3.5, three lines of text should display.
This demonstrates some of the behaviors noted earlier in this article. To
display four lines of text, set the Height property to 4.5. Setting the
ScaleMode back to Pixels will change this number to a value consistent with
pixel measurements.
