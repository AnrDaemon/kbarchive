PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Software Development Kits
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Telephony Software Development Kit (SDK), version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the International Control Panel Applet (CPL), if the current country is set
to Canada, then the Telephony CPL will display the following error when a new
location is added:

   Internal Application error; please shut down and restart this application.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only workaround is to use the International CPL to change the location to
something other than Canada (United States is a logical choice), add the new
Telephony location, and then change the location back to Canada.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Windows 95.
