SUMMARY
=======

Explorapedia World of Nature and World of People were designed as products so
easy to navigate and use that help is rarely needed. For the times when you
would like some guidance or assistance, you can rely on the character guide.
Regardless of where you are in Explorapedia, the character Thaddeus (you can
call him Tad) Pole provides you with all the options that are available. A
simple click on Tad lets you know what you can do in that particular area of
Explorapedia, and offers you the options for moving to other areas.
