SUMMARY
=======

The FatalExit messages "Local heap is busy" (0x0140) and "Critical section
problems" (0x0240) indicate internal errors in Windows's memory management
routines; 0x0140 indicates an incorrect attempt to enter or leave a critical
section in the local memory manager; 0x0240 indicates that the total number of
free handles doesn't match up.

These errors shouldn't occur unless something gets destroyed; this is usually an
indication that an application is destroying memory by writing to an area where
it shouldn't.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10 rip dgroup
