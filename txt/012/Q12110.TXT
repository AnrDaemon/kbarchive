SUMMARY
=======

The text below provides a method for a C application to check the status of a
printer before it attempts to write data to the printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Even though the C language does not define a portable method to check printer
status, your application can retrieve this information using routines in the ROM
BIOS. To obtain status information, call the _bios_printer() function, an
interface to Interrupt 17H, Function 2, or call the interrupt directly through
the int86() functions. For more information, see the online help file or the
run-time library reference manual provided with your compiler.

In your application, you may want to process printer errors by changing the
critical error handler interrupt vector (the Interrupt 24H vector). The default
critical error handler presents the user with the notorious "abort, retry,
ignore" message. Your application can provide a substitute message, like
"Printer offline: place printer on line and press Y to continue."
