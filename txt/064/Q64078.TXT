SUMMARY
=======

In versions of Windows earlier than 3.0, it is possible to align columns of
information in a list box with spaces, because all characters in the system font
are the same width. In Windows 3.0, the system font is proportionally spaced
with letters of differing widths, which prevents this technique from being
usable.

Tabs can be used to align columns in a list box. The LBS_USETABSTOPS style must
be specified when the list box is created. Then, set a tab to correspond with
the position of each character of each numeric column. The tabs are specified in
dialog units, which are one-fourth of a character width. For example, a
three-digit field that should align 12 characters from the left edge of the
dialog box can be implemented by setting tabs at positions 40, 44, and 48. This
is illustrated below:

    +------------+
    |text     xxx|
    |longer    xx|
              ^^^
              ||+- position 48
              |+-- position 44
              +--- position 40

After determining the text to insert in the list box, convert the spaces to the
appropriate number of tabs as the following code fragment demonstrates:

      sprintf(szNumBuffer, "%3d", Number);
      for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)

        if (szNumBuffer[i] == ' ')
           szNumBuffer[i] = '\t';

This code uses the three tabs set above.

There is a file in the Microsoft Download Center named RIGHTJUS that illustrates
this convention.

NOTE: This sample is applicable only to Windows 3.1, NOT to Win32.
