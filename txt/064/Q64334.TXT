SUMMARY
=======

The "Microsoft Flight Simulator Information Manual and Flight Handbook" for
version 4.00 incorrectly states the maximum altitude and the speed for the Gates
Learjet 25G on Page 48. The manual states that the maximum altitude is 45,000
feet and the maximum speed is 445 knots.

The correct maximum altitude and the speed for the Gates Learjet 25G is 51,000
feet and 464 knots. The correct information can be found in Appendix C, Page
165, of the Flight Simulator manual.
