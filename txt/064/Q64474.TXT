-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print boxes with rounded corners with the HPPCL driver version 3.3, the
corners are thicker than the straight lines.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the HPPCL driver version 3.3
shipped with Microsoft Windows version 3.0. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem is noticeable in applications such as PageMaker and Paintbrush,
which draw boxes with rounded corners. Earlier versions of the HPPCL driver
printed rounded corners correctly.

This driver is used for Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet, LaserJet Series II, and
compatible printers.

Some of the products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
