The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing soft fonts using the Bitstream FontWare Installation Kit,
FontWare should create a new printer section, [Canon LBP8 Europe], if you
install the fonts for the Canon LBP8 or LBP4 printer driver. This does not work
with the Microsoft Windows 3.0 Canon printer driver.

CAUSE
=====

The FontWare program looks at the printer driver header information in the
WIN.INI file to determine where to insert the font information. FontWare is
looking for a [Canon LBP8 Europe] printer driver section when it reads the
WIN.INI. The Windows 3.0 Canon driver has changed the header information to
[canoniii]. Since FontWare can't find the old header section, it creates a new
one and places all of the font information under that header.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct the problem, remove the [Canon LBP8 Europe] section and copy all of
the font information over to the [canoniii] section in WIN.INI.
