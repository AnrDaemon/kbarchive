SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Excel for Windows reports a printer on the None port from Printer
Setup when running under Microsoft Windows version 3.0. This only affects
printers that are inactive under the Windows Control Panel. The printer is still
on the port, but Excel by default shows it on None if it is inactive.

Excel's Printer Setup dialog box reports information from the [Devices] section
of WIN.INI. An inactive printer is shown on None in this section. The Windows
Control Panel reports information from the [PrinterPorts] section of WIN.INI,
where the printer is correctly shown on the port. However, it also contains a
parameter that designates the printer as inactive.

Microsoft Powerpoint for Windows exhibits this same behavior.
