The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

To load a .TXT file from Microsoft Windows 3.0 File Manager and load it into
Microsoft Word for MS-DOS version 5.0, create a PIF file for Word 5.0 and
associate the .TXT file to the PIF file in File Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Follow these steps to load the .TXT file into Word 5.0:

1. Create a PIF file for Word 5.0. (Refer to pages 444-482 in the "Microsoft
   Windows User's Guide" for information on creating PIF files.) The Start Up
   Directory line should NOT contain an entry. If ANY entry is listed in this
   line of the PIF file, Word 5.00 will not load the desired file.

2. In File Manager, choose a file that has a .TXT extension.

3. From the File menu, choose Associate.

4. Enter the path and name of the Word 5.0 PIF file. For example,
   "C:\WORD5\WORD.PIF" (without the quotation marks) if WORD.PIF is located in
   the Word directory.

REFERENCES
==========

For more information about the File Associate option, see pages 135-137 of the
"Microsoft Windows User's Guide." This method may be used for any extension (for
example, .TXT, .C, .DOC) and for any MS-DOS editor or application (for example,
WordStar, WordPerfect, Microsoft Editor, etc.).
