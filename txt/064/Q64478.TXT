SUMMARY
=======

Mathematica 387 and Mathlab 386 do not run properly in Microsoft Windows version
3.0 protected modes (standard and enhanced). These programs use the VCPI
(virtual control program interface) to access extended memory that conflicts
with Windows in protected mode (standard and enhanced).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The VCPI specification allows MS-DOS applications to directly access extended
memory on 80386 machines. Windows uses the DPMI (DOS protected mode interface)
specification. The DPMI specification allows MS-DOS applications to directly
access memory on 80286 and 80386 machines. Many programs that use the VCPI
specification, including Lotus 123 version 3.0, run correctly in standard mode
Windows. The performance of an MS-DOS application that uses the VCPI
specification depends on how closely the actual application follows the VCPI
specification.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
