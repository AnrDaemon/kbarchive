SUMMARY
=======

By design, the Microsoft Windows PostScript printer driver downloads soft fonts
once for each page of the document. To speed printing, soft font developers,
such as Adobe and Bitstream, provide utilities that download soft fonts prior to
printing (that is, in the AUTOEXEC.BAT).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Soft fonts are downloaded on a per page basis, mainly because the PostScript
language does not allow memory to be reclaimed once it has been used. There are
PostScript commands to "save" and "restore" the state of the printer (the memory
that has been allocated). It is necessary to issue a save/restore pair around
every page so that the printer does not run out of memory (due to the regular
process of printing, or to downloading soft fonts).

The result is that the fonts have to be downloaded on a per page basis because
fonts that are downloaded inside a save/restore pair are lost.

Download the fonts before the print job and treat them as if they are permanently
installed.
