The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows version 3.0 builds the NETWARE.INI text file upon entering the
Network section of the Control Panel for the first time. The NETWARE.INI file
tells the NetWare driver what commands are available under the Network icon in
the Windows Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Modifying the NETWARE.INI File
------------------------------

The NETWARE.INI file can be modified using any text editor. It may be easier to
use the Notepad application since it is included with the Windows package. Any
application, command, or utility that runs under Windows can be added to the
NETWARE.INI file.

The file header must not be changed. It must appear before the command lines. The
following is a sample modified NETWARE.INI file:

      [MSW30-Utils]

      Attach A File Server=<Attach
      Detach A File Server=<Detach
      Disable Broadcast Messages=<No Messages
      Enable Broadcast Messages=<Messages
      A Game of Dots=REVERSI.EXE
      Show Your Timepiece=CLOCK
      Run System Console=SYSCON.EXE
      Acctg/Laser/Landscape=capture l=1 j=0

The first four commands are default commands, as indicated by the less-than sign
(<) preceding the command.

There are several rules for modifying the NETWARE.INI file, as follows:

1. The command line includes the title of the command that will appear in the
   Network Utilities dialog when the Network icon is opened. To the right of the
   command title is an equal sign (=) and the name of the executable file for
   the appropriate program or command.

2. The total length of all the titles cannot exceed 512 characters.

3. The total number of characters after the "=" for each command line cannot
   exceed 128.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a
