SUMMARY
=======

Do not call any function that may cause control to yield to another application
during the processing of any of the following messages:

   WM_ACTIVATE
   WM_ACTIVATEAPP
   WM_CREATE
   WM_INITDIALOG
   WM_NCCREATE

Certain messages are used to notify applications of some change in Windows's
internal status. While processing one of these messages, an application cannot
call any function that may result in control being yielded to another
application. Forbidden functions include message-processing functions such as
MessageBox(), DialogBox(), GetMessage(), and PeekMessage().

Violating this caveat may cause Windows to exhibit strange visual behavior.
