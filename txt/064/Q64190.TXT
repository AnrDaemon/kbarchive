The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows allows you to run Windows applications that have 256- color
support built into them; however, the graphics card and the Windows screen
driver must support 256 colors. Windows applications that do not have 256-color
support built into them are unable to use the 256-color support of Windows. For
example, if you are using an application such as Paintbrush and you have only 16
colors, your 16-color limitation may occur because the graphics card or the
screen driver only supports 16 colors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each Windows application is written to support a maximum number of colors. For
example, Microsoft Paintbrush supports 256 colors; however, Microsoft PowerPoint
supports 16.8 million colors.

Color support for Windows applications is determined by the following:

 - What the application was written to support.

 - What the graphics card supports.

 - What the Windows screen driver supports.
