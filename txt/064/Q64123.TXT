TITLE   :PRB: Encountering an INT 01 with WDEB386
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When debugging an application with WDEB386, the program halts on a breakpoint at
an INT 01 instruction.

CAUSE
=====

An INT 01 is coded into Windows in the Fatal_Error_Handler. This interrupt is
hit when some device driver is doing a fatal exit. The INT 01 is there to make
the debugger useful when diagnosing the fatal error. INT 01 in virtual devices
(VxDs) is generally ignored (treated as a NOP instruction) in the retail version
of Windows. However, if the debugger is installed, the system breaks into the
debugger.

RESOLUTION
==========

Diagnose and correct the cause of the fatal exit.
