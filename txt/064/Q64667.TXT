The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have an ALR Powerflex computer and you experience either of the following
symptoms while using Microsoft Windows:

 - Your serial mouse has erratic mouse-cursor movement in any of the three modes
   of Windows.

 - Your serial mouse grabs items in Windows, even if you do not press any of the
   buttons on the mouse.

CAUSE
=====

These problems occur with some older ALR motherboards.

To determine if a motherboard evision will correct the problem, follow these
steps:

1. Turn the computer off.

2. Take the cover off of the computer.

3. Look near the edges of the green motherboard for a white sticker. This
   sticker will contain revision letters or numbers (for example, "C-N").

4. Look for a prominent period or a "bullet" (for example, "C-N.OP" or "C-N.").

NOTE: If you do NOT see a period or bullet, contact your local ALR dealer for a
motherboard revision. If you DO see a period or bullet, a motherboard revision
is not the solution.

The ALR products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products
performance or reliability.
