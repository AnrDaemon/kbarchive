SUMMARY
=======


This article describes how to set the default font you want in Word for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default font for Word is defined in the Normal style of the Normal.dot
template. The Normal.dot template is used if you do not specify another
template. To change the style of the default font, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click New.

2. Click the General tab, click Blank Document, then click OK.

3. On the Format menu, click Font.

4. Select the font name, point size, and any attributes that you want as
   defaults for documents based on the Normal.dot template.

5. Click the Default button. You are prompted with the following message:

   Do you want to change the default font <font name>, <point size>?
   This change affects all new documents based on the NORMAL template.

6. Click Yes to confirm that you want all documents you create that are based on
   the current template to reflect this change to the Normal style.

7. Hold down the SHIFT key while clicking on the File menu, and click Save All.

Word will not prompt you to save the changes to the Normal.dot file unless you
have the "Prompt to Save Normal Template" option selected on the Save tab of the
Options dialog box (on the Tools menu, click Options).
