The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a

The following printers are listed on SETUP.INF on the 5.25-inch Setup
Disk; however, they are not listed on SETUP.INF on the 3.5-inch Setup
Disk:

   NEC PinWriter P6
   NEC PinWriter P7
   NEC PinWriter P2200
   NEC PinWriter P5200
   NEC Silentwriter LC 860 [PCL / HP LaserJet]
   NEC Silentwriter LC 860 Plus [PCL / HP LaserJet]

One workaround for this problem is to install for the P5300 because
the printers above share the same driver; then, configure for the
correct printer in the Printer Setup of the Control Panel. For the LC
860 printers, it is necessary to install for the PCL/HP LaserJet
driver.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a winsetup
