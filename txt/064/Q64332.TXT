SUMMARY
=======

The PostScript driver version 3.30 included with Microsoft Windows version 3.0
does not save the setting for the scaling factor between Windows sessions. To
illustrate this problem, go into the PostScript driver and set the scaling for
70 percent. Once this is accomplished, exit Windows, then restart and check the
scaling factor. It will be set back to 100 percent.

This behavior is by design. Settings like this are reset to the default on every
Windows session, so you don't leave yourself at some unusual setting, wondering
why your documents are smaller/larger than usual.
