TITLE   :"Cannot Open File current.$" May Mean INIT Incorrect

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.1 
 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using the Programmer's Workbench (PWB) version 1.0 or 1.1, the following
message may appear as a pop-up dialog box when choosing Compile or MS-DOS Shell
(or OS/2 Shell for OS/2):

   +----- Cannot open file! -----+
   | D:\TEST\SRC\X\current.$ |
   | No such file or directory |
   |-----------------------------|
   | < OK > < Help > |
   +-----------------------------+

One cause for this error is an incorrect setting of the INIT environment
variable. To remedy the situation, exit PWB and make sure that the INIT
environment variable is set to a valid directory name (that is, a directory that
exists).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce this message, set your INIT environment variable to an invalid
directory, for example (if a directory named X does not exist on your drive):

   SET INIT=C:\X

Then start PWB and try to compile a program. The message will appear in the
middle of the screen.

One possible reason why your INIT environment variable may be set incorrectly,
even if your AUTOEXEC.BAT sets it correctly, is that you might have run out of
environment space in the setting of the variable. You can refer to the "MS-DOS
Encyclopedia," Article 2, for more information about increasing your environment
space.
