SUMMARY
=======

A window cannot be resized using the "resize" function in a macro. in the
Programmer's WorkBench (PWB). After PWB performs the resize function, it waits
for the you to respond with the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW key. Functions that are
placed in the macro after the resize function are ignored. If "record on" is
selected and you try to record the resizing of a window, the macro will stop
recording until the ENTER key on the numeric keypad is pressed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an example:

   resizeit:= cancel arg arg nextmsg window resize up up up NumEnter

The above example stops at the resize function and waits for you to resize the
window. The remaining functions are ignored.

To make a window a specified size, move the cursor to a location on the screen
and then open the window with the "window" function.

The following is an example of a macro that opens the "<compile>" window
with a specified size:

   compile_size:= up up up up up up up up up up
   resize_it:=cancel meta down compile_size arg window window arg \ 
              "<compile>" setfile window
   resize_it:ALT+U

Note: The size of the compile window can be adjusted by changing the number of
ups on the compile_size line.
