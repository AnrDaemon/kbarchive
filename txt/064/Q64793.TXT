TITLE   :Bus Speed 3C603 Token Link Card Problem w/ LAN Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

   When attempting to start OS/2 or MS-DOS LAN Manager version 2.x for the first
   time on a Gateway 2000 (25-MHz 386, 8 MB) computer with a 3Com 3C603 Token
   Link card, NET STARTing the server causes the OS/2 system to hang. At this
   point, only a power shutdown can revive the system.

CAUSE
=====

   By default, a Gateway 2000 computer has a bus speed of 12 MHz, which must be
   changed to 8 MHz by setting the appropriate jumpers on the motherboard. Once
   the bus speed has been set to a lower value (8 MHz), the 3C603 Token Link
   card will work correctly, and so will OS/2 or DOS LAN Manager.

   The reason the bus speed must be changed is that all ISA net cards are
   designed to run with a bus clock of 6 to 8.333 MHz. Therefore, a higher (or
   different) bus clock frequency will affect all ISA devices in an unspecified
   manner.

   EISA devices (net cards) are designed to handle higher bus clock frequencies
   (up to 33 MHz).
