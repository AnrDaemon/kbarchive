-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience problems when using the Logitech Serial Mouse with Microsoft
Windows version 3.0.

CAUSE
=====

Logitech terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs conflict with the operation
and installation of Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

You should remark out the LOGIMENU and CLICK TSR programs if they are listing in
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. In addition, if you find the GOMOUSE.BAT file, replace
it with a MOUSE.COM file dated 10/02/89 because the GOMOUSE.BAT file may also
contain LOGIMENU and CLICK.

If your mouse continues to exhibit problems, refer to the following
troubleshooting sections to resolve the problem(s).

Mouse Pointer Doesn't Move or Doesn't Appear
--------------------------------------------

In addition to problems caused by TSRs, you may notice that the Mouse pointer
intermittently shows up in Windows 3.0 but does not move, or that the mouse
pointer may not display at all.

1. Verify the Windows Logitech Serial Mouse Driver is installed by selecting the
   Setup icon from the Main group of Program Manager. Verify that the mouse
   driver file is the corect size and date: the Windows 3.0 file should be dated
   5/1/90 and the 3.00a file should be dated 10/31/90; either version should be
   3584 bytes in size. Files of different sizes or dates may still be
   compressed, or may be corrupted, or may have been provided with an OEM
   version of Windows. Also verify that a Microsoft VGA or EGA driver is loaded
   rather than a Super VGA driver.

2. If you have one of the following combinations, use TYPE=2 at the end of the
   WIN.INI file:

   BUS card and Logitech serial-type mouse (including serial Trackman)

   PS/2-type port and Logitech serial-type mouse (including serial Trackman)

   Copy the following example to the end of the WIN.INI file:

         [MOUSE]
         TYPE=2

   NOTE: According to Logitech, TYPE=3 is no longer supported by the Windows 3.00
   Logitech Serial Mouse driver.

3. Boot with a minimal CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT.

   The CONFIG.SYS file should contain FILES=30, BUFFERS=30, DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS, and
   required disk-partitioning drivers.

   The AUTOEXEC.BAT file should contain PROMPT $P$G and a PATH command to DOS,
   WINDOWS, and the root directory.

   Reboot the machine with this configuration. When the machine reboots, the BIOS
   and DOS versions may be displayed along with the amount of memory. Write
   these down and verify that the DOS version is the correct version for the
   machine, and verify that the BIOS is at least 1988 or later.

4. Check that no other device is using the same interrupt. If the mouse is on
   COM1, then no other device should be set for Interrupt 4. If the mouse is on
   COM2, then no other device should be set for Interrupt 3.

5. Check the serial card containing COM ports for the Logitech Mouse. Look at
   the card for a square chip. It may read WINBOND with a number underneath it
   resembling W86C452P. If that chip exists, it should be replaced with a
   different serial-card model. (If replacing the card is not an option, proceed
   to Step 6).

6. If all else fails, re-install the Windows mouse driver for the following:

   Mouse Systems (or VisiOn) connected to COM1

   -OR-

   Mouse Systems (or VisiOn) connected to COM2

Problems After Starting MS-DOS Applications
-------------------------------------------

Another problem you may have with the Logitech Mouse may occur when starting any
MS-DOS application under Windows (including the MS-DOS prompt). In this case,
quitting or switching back to Windows may cause erratic mouse movement. If the
mouse pointer moves slowly, jumps from point to point on the screen, or moves at
different speeds when running non-Windows applications, you may have a problem
with the MS-DOS mouse-driver file. You can avoid this problem as follows:

1. Install version 4.10 of the Logitech Mouse Driver for MS-DOS systems that is
   usually located on the second disk of the Logitech MouseWare Utilities Disk
   for version 4.01.

   Do not confuse the version of the MouseWare Utilities Disk for 4.01 with the
   Logitech Mouse DOS Driver for version 4.10.

2. If Step 6 above was used to resolve Symptom #1, then you may have to create a
   batch file that contains the following two lines:

         <appname>.EXE {the name of the DOS application being run}
         MOUSE PC

Follow the steps on Page 448 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" that explain
"Creating PIFs for Batch Files."
