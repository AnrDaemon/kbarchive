SUMMARY
=======

The following information is provided by Adobe Corporation.

Adobe soft fonts work correctly with Microsoft Windows version 3.0. However, you
may see some screen distortion due to the different screen aspect ratio for
which the screen fonts were designed.

When printing from Windows 3.0, you should be able to print the correct fonts.
However, you may not get the correct screen representation of the fonts.

Microsoft Word for Windows is a WYSIWYG application; therefore, it has higher
standards for which fonts it will use. If the font does not comply to Word for
Windows standards in screen aspect ratio, you may not be able to view your font
in Word for Windows. Other problems related to use of Adobe soft fonts with Word
for Windows include erratic printouts with incorrect font mapping. This should
be corrected with an upgrade from Adobe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Adobe corporation will be releasing a new package that will generate screen
fonts for Windows 3.00 and will solve the screen aspect ratio problems.

For more information on Adobe font upgrades, please contact the Adobe
Corporation.
