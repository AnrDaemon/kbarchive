PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Unless you specify otherwise, WordPerfect version 5.1 first uses all available
conventional memory, then available expanded memory. It does not recognize
extended memory. Microsoft Windows version 3.0 has the ability to provide
expanded memory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Release 11-06-89 of the WP.EXE program did not handle expanded memory properly.
WordPerfect is aware of this problem and will issue a free upgrade to registered
users. Contact WordPerfect for more information.

You may find the release date of the version by pressing the F3 key (Help). The
date is in the upper-right corner of the screen. Press your space bar to leave
the Help screen. You can search the directory of the file to find the date.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around the problem by starting WordPerfect with "/ne" (without the
quotation marks) in the Optional Parameters line in the PIF Editor. This tells
WordPerfect to start without using the expanded memory.

NOTE: This parameter may also help with other releases of WordPerfect, and may
also correct a problem where Windows stops responding (hangs) after starting
WordPerfect.

The parameter "/32" (without the quotation marks) may help in releases dated
later than 11-06-89. This parameter tells WordPerfect to apply the 3.2 LIM
specifications. Other problems regarding screen display may be resolved with
this option also.

we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance
or reliability.
