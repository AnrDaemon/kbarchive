SYMPTOMS
========

When you select the International icon from the Control Panel in Microsoft
Windows 3.0, and change the keyboard layout to a non-U.S. country, you are
prompted to insert a setup disk with the appropriate filename. You are prompted
every time you change the layout to this country, even though the file has
already been copied and is already in the WINDOWS directory. Typing the
appropriate pathname to the file does not work correctly.

This behavior does not occur when you change the keyboard layout back to U.S.

WORKAROUND
==========

Open the SYSTEM.INI file and insert the appropriate filename after KEYBOARD.DLL
in the [keyboard] section. This is easier for those in bilingual countries who
change keyboard layouts often.
