SUMMARY
=======

Columbia Data Products has Western Digital 7000 Fasst SCSI hard disk controller
drivers that are compatible with Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0
and 3.1. The version of the SST driver for Windows is 3.36. This driver is
available for a charge from Columbia Data Products. Version 3.3 through 3.35 of
the SST drivers may work with Windows 3.0 and 3.1; however, Columbia Data
Products does not guarantee the results.

To use Windows 3.0 and 3.1 with the Fasst SCSI hard drive controller, edit the
CONFIG.SYS file to read as follows:

      DEVICE=SSTBIO.SYS /W:1
      DEVICE=SSTDRIVE.SYS

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to Columbia Data Products, these drivers may not work correctly if
they are loaded high. SMARTDrive version 4.0 (SMARTDRV.EXE) may cause the system
to stop responding (hang) or lock up at system startup if the SCSI drivers are
loaded high.

For additional information relating to these drivers, contact Columbia Data
Products.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
