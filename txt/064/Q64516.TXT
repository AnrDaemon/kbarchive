SUMMARY
=======

You may need to turn the Autocontinue option off on a Hewlett-Packard (HP)
LaserJet III when you troubleshoot printing problems with Microsoft Windows 3.0.
Autocontinue is an option on the LaserJet III that causes the printer to
continue to try to print after an error occurs. If you turn Autocontinue off,
the error displays on the LCD panel and then allows you to reset the printer to
continue printing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To turn Autocontinue off, do the following:

1. Turn the ONLINE button off.

2. Press the MENU button and hold it until "Autocontinue = ON *" is displayed.

3. Press the plus (+) button so it displays "Autocontinue = OFF."

4. Press the ENTER button to save the action (an asterisk [*] will appear).

Once this is done, all printing problems will be displayed on the HP LaserJet's
LCD panel.
