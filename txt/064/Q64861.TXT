SUMMARY
=======

The QMS Jetscript may not function correctly under Microsoft Windows version 3.0
unless a file is created and copied to the printer. To create this file, do the
following:

1. Using a text editor such as Notepad, type the following text (all characters
   must be lowercase):

   " serverdict begin 0 exitserver
   statusdict begin
   0 setdefaultparallel
   0 setparallel
   start" (without the quotation marks)

2. Save this file as R.ON for Reverse channel ON (the file must be saved as an
   unformatted text file or ASCII file).

3. Copy R.ON to the printer. You can do this by entering the following from a
   DOS prompt

   " COPY R.ON LPTx:" (without the quotation marks)

   where x is a number between 1 and 3
