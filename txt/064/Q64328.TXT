SUMMARY
=======

An owner-draw button can be defined and drawn to provide any desired appearance,
even to mimic the three-dimensional push buttons of Windows version 3.0. With an
owner-draw button, the application can control the button face color, unlike a
standard push button, which always has a gray face.

The ODBUTTON sample source code can be used as a template for creating other
applications. The main task involves creating appropriate bitmaps.

Under Windows 2.x, an application can change the color of the button face by
processing WM_CTLCOLOR messages. This functionality is not available in Windows
3.0. However, the more powerful owner-draw feature can be used to achieve the
same effect.

Like a Windows 3.0 standard push button, this sample owner-draw button indicates
that it has the focus by drawing a dashed, black rectangular border around the
button text. This is accomplished by using the new Windows 3.0 function,
DrawFocusRect(). Like the text of the button, the focus rectangle must also be
shifted right and down two pixels when the button is pressed.

Bitmaps are created in a fixed size, in pixels, regardless of the display
resolution used. An application can determine which display is in use by reading
the SYSTEM.INI file. Two alternatives are available to create buttons that are
an appropriate size on different displays, as follows:

1. Create different pairs of default/pressed bitmaps for each display resolution
   the application is targeted (for example, Hercules monochrome, CGA, EGA, VGA,
   super VGA, and 8514).

2. Create separate bitmaps for the borders of the button and for the button
   faces. During the initialization of the application, make four calls to
   StretchBlt(). The first call should modify the left and right borders
   vertically. The second call should change the top and bottom borders
   horizontally. The third and fourth calls should modify each button face
   bitmap both horizontally and vertically. Doing separate calls eliminates
   distortion to the border widths as a display-specific bitmap is created.

Apart from the information discussed above, owner-draw buttons are handled like
other owner-draw controls. However, Windows does not send the application a
WM_MEASUREITEM message to define the dimensions of the button control
dynamically. The dimensions of the owner-draw button are specified in a dialog
box template or CreateWindow() call, similar to the dimensions of nonowner-draw
buttons.

Like other owner-draw controls, the application draws the owner-draw button in
response to a WM_DRAWITEM message. Drawing should take into account the
selection and focus states of the control, as well as the normal state without
either selection or focus.
