-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When running under Windows, the Mouse Systems Bus Mouse should be set to an
interrupt level (IRQ) of 2 to 7. You may experience erratic operation if the bus
card is set for an IRQ higher than IRQ 7, or for an IRQ that the system is
already using. (According to Mouse Systems technical support, the bus mouse can
be configured for IRQ 2 to 15.)

In addition, to ensure compatibility with Windows, be sure that your Mouse
Systems MS-DOS mouse driver is version 7.0 or later.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a list of devices and the IRQ numbers that they commonly use.
Be sure that your mouse setting does not conflict with any other devices you may
be using:

   Device                           IRQ

   AT/386 hard disk controller       2
   COM2 (serial port 2)              3
   COM1 (serial port 1)              4

Update Your Mouse Systems Driver for Windows 3.0, 3.0a
------------------------------------------------------

You may need to update your Mouse Systems mouse drivers to run Windows 3.0 or
3.0a successfully. Mouse Systems provides an application on its bulletin board
(BBS) called WIN3DRV.EXE, which is a self-extracting file that copies all the
files you need to drive A.

After you download the WIN3DRV.EXE file from the BBS:

1. Run Setup from the WINDOWS directory, and choose Other for the mouse section
   of Setup.

2. Follow the directions on the screen to load the correct Windows 3.0 mouse
   driver.

For further information, please call Mouse Systems technical support.
