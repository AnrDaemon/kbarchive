SUMMARY
=======

When you print to a port such as LPT1.OS2 or LPT2.OS2, you may receive the error
message "Cannot Create File" in Microsoft Windows if the last drive accessed is
no longer available. If the last drive accessed was a floppy disk drive, then
you may receive the message "System Error, Cannot Read From Drive X:," where X
is the name of the drive.

For example, if the last drive that was accessed in Windows was drive A and there
is currently no disk in drive A (or if the drive door is not shut) and you
attempt to print to a file, you will receive the message "System Error, Cannot
Read From Drive A:."

It is necessary to access a valid drive before you print to a file or insert a
disk (with enough disk space) into the drive in question before you select a
print option.
