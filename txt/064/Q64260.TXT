SUMMARY
=======

When you run a batch file from the Microsoft Windows File Run command in Program
Manager, you are returned to Windows after completion of the batch file. This
happens whether you start the batch file from an icon or a PIF file. To remain
at an MS-DOS prompt after the batch file has been executed, include COMMAND.COM
as the last command in the batch file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows automatically closes the window upon exiting any program running under
it. When you run a batch file from Windows, no matter how it is evoked, Windows
considers it a program that is closed upon completion of the steps in the batch
file. The only way to avoid returning to the Program Manager screen is to have
the last command in the batch file start another copy of COMMAND.COM; then the
virtual machine is maintained until that COMMAND.COM is exited.

You do not have to type "EXIT" (without the quotation marks) twice to quit this
virtual machine and return to the Program Manager. The first instance of
COMMAND.COM is terminated upon completion of the batch file. Only the second
instance of COMMAND.COM, the one started as the last command within the batch
file, remains open until you type "EXIT" to return to Program Manager.
