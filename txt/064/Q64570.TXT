The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you launch an MS-DOS command box (an MS-DOS virtual machine) under
Microsoft Windows or Windows for Workgroups, you can't run FASTOPEN.EXE or
SHARE.EXE. Even if you have not loaded the Fastopen program before running
Windows, you receive a message that reports that Fastopen or Share has
already been loaded.

The message telling you that Fastopen or Share has already been started is
by design. The message was implemented to prevent Fastopen and Share from
being started in a virtual machine because they can crash the system. This
is because these utilities are all MS-DOS kernel extensions and MS-DOS and
Windows are not set up to support loading MS-DOS kernel extensions in a
virtual machine.
