SUMMARY
=======

When recording a Flight Simulator demo while in multiplayer mode, you must turn
on the recorder first and then go online and send the aircraft. If two players
are online and have already sent their aircraft, Flight Simulator will disrupt
the connection and the two players must reconnect.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
