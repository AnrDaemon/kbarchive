-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using Microsoft Mail version 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, or 3.0 with the AppleLink
gateway, if an AppleLink gateway server fails to send an AppleLink message
within the time period for returning undeliverable mail specified in Server
Settings, an undeliverable mail message is NOT sent to the sender.

The only way the sender can ensure messages are sent to AppleLink is to send the
message with the return receipt option or carbon copy his or her own AppleLink
account.

If the sender enters a bad AppleLink address, the AppleLink gateway will send an
"Undeliverable Mail" message to the sender. If the AppleLink gateway encounters
a problem while connecting to or sending a message to AppleLink, the gateway
creates a problem report message and sends it to the Network Manager; however,
nothing is sent to the account that originated the message.
