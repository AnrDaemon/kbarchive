TITLE   :FIX: Incorrect Code Generated for IRET With PROC USES
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.1,5.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.1, 5.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A procedure that uses the USES keyword cannot return by using IRET. The USES
statement pushes the specified registers on the stack upon entry and pops them
before exiting a procedure. If the USES keyword is used with a procedure that
ends with an IRET instruction, the pushes will be generated for the procedure,
but the pops will not.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 5.1 and 5.1a. This
problem has been corrected in MASM version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code demonstrates the problem. The di, si, and bp registers will
be pushed onto the stack, but not popped.

Source Code:
------------

   ; Compile options needed: none

            .model large, c

            .code

      first PROC far uses di si bp
            MOV si,3
            MOV di,4
            IRET
      first ENDP

            END first
