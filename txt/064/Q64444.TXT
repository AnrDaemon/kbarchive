KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The CTRL (Control) keys may not function correctly on the Monterey International
104 key US keyboard, Model K104, when you use Microsoft Windows version 3.0.

CAUSE
=====

This keyboard has three possible settings: a(at), x(xt), and s(standard). If you
set the keyboard to position "a" and choose "101 or 102 key US and Non-US
keyboard" in Windows Setup, the CTRL key sends the same ASCII code as the SHIFT
key.

WORKAROUND
==========

A possible workaround is to configure the keyboard as "All AT type keyboards"
(84-86 keys) in Windows Setup, and place the keyboard selector in position "a."
Note that this method disables F11 and F12. There may be other undocumented
compromises to keyboard functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================
