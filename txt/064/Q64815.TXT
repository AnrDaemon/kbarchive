SUMMARY
=======

If you are in real or standard mode of Microsoft Windows version 3.0, and you
want to take information out of an MS-DOS application and place it into the
Clipboard, press the PRINT SCREEN key while you are in the MS-DOS application.
This copies the contents of the entire screen to the Clipboard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To paste into an MS-DOS application in these modes, do the following:

1. Run the application. Then place the cursor at the point where the pasted text
   should appear.

2. Switch out of the application by pressing ALT+TAB, ALT+ESC, or CTRL+ESC.

3. In Windows, copy the text you want to paste into the Clipboard.

4. Click once on the MS-DOS application's icon to bring up its system menu.

5. Choose Paste from the menu. This brings up the MS-DOS application and pastes
   the text from the Clipboard into the application. The text is pasted at the
   point it would be inserted if the text were typed directly into the
   application.
