SUMMARY
=======

As documented on page 79 of the "Microsoft C Reference" shipped with C version
6.0 and in the online help, the "deflang" switch in the Programmer's WorkBench
(PWB) sets the default filename extension for list boxes in PWB dialog boxes.
Another (undocumented) feature of this switch is to enable you to be prompted to
"Set Program List?" when loading a source file with a .MAK file associated with
it in the current directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, "deflang" is not set. You can set the deflang switch in the [PWB]
tagged section of the TOOLS.INI file, for example:

   deflang:C

This changes the default filename extension in PWB's dialog boxes (such as Open
in the File menu) from "*.*" to "*.c", so that only files with the .c extension
show up by default. Other languages can be specified as well, as shown below:

   Switch Setting     Extension
   --------------     ---------
   no value            .*
   C                   .c
   Asm                 .asm
   BASIC               .bas
   FORTRAN             .for
   Pascal              .pas
   COBOL               .cbl
   LISP                .lsp

Note that the online documentation specifies "Assembler" as the switch to use for
.ASM files, but this is incorrect. "Asm" is the correct switch to use to make
Assembler the default language.

The deflang switch also enables you to be prompted as to whether or not the
program list should be set automatically. If you load a file that has the
extension specified by the "deflang" switch and you also have a .MAK file with
the same base filename in the same directory, PWB will prompt you about loading
the program list.

For example, assume that deflang is set to C, and TEST.MAK and TEST.C are in the
same directory. If you type PWB TEST.C at the command-prompt, PWB will pause
when loading and prompt with "Set Program List? TEST.MAK". At this point you can
specify yes or no.

When already in PWB, if you choose Open from the File menu, and select TEST.C as
the file to open, PWB will also prompt you at this point regarding whether or
not you want TEST.MAK loaded as the program list, but only if NO program list is
currently set.

Note that beginning with PWB version 1.1, command-line switches are provided that
allow the automatic loading of a program list.
