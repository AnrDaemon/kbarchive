SUMMARY
=======

If you apply a trap throttle that is too rigid, you will find that no traps are
sent, and you will see information similar to the following in the Snmpelea.trc
file:

      03/06/1997 14:51:24 SnmpEvLogProc: Event detected log record written for
      Security - 1 - 00148440

      03/06/1997 14:51:24 SnmpEvLogProc: Performance threshold flag is on. No
      data will be processed.

      03/06/1997 14:51:24 SnmpEvLogProc: Allocating memory for log event
      record

The trap throttle is a mechanism to prevent SNMP traps from flooding your
network.

To correct the problem and begin sending traps again from a specific client, do
the following from the Systems Management Server Administrator:

1. Open the Personal Computer Properties for the affected client.

2. From the Windows NT Administrative Tools group, start the Event to Trap
   Translator program.

3. Click Settings and select Don't Apply Throttle. Click OK twice to save the
   settings to the client computer's registry.

4. Start the Event to Trap Translator program for the client again and click
   Settings.

5. Select Apply Throttle and define an acceptable level (the default is 500
   traps in 300 seconds).

6. Click Reset and then click OK twice to update the client computer's registry.
