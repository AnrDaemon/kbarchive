TITLE   :Range Of LUs Wizard Should Use 2 Digits if Base is Hexadecimal
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When setting up a range of LUs, if you add the LUs with leading zeros, Manager
will create the LUs with three characters. This should not be an issue for most
users, but may cause a problem if your base LU name contains six characters.

NOTE: If you are using decimal you will be limited to a five character base name
when using leading zeros. If you have less than 100 LUs you can use a six
character base name without leading zeros.

RESOLUTION
==========

The wizard was modified so that it only adds two hex digits to the LU name
base.

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

The modified file is:

   <Snaroot>\System\Snawiz.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
