The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS

In Visual FoxPro 5.x, the Page Activate event within a PageFrame is not
triggered when the Page is activated with the arrow key. However, the Page
Activate event triggers when the Page is activated with the mouse click.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form.

2. Add a PageFrame to the form and set the PageCount property to 1.

3. Put the following code in the Activate event of page1:

   WAIT WINDOW "Activate Page 1"

4. Add two textbox controls to the Page.

5. Save and run the form.

   When the form is run, the Wait window appears in the right-hand corner. Click
   the mouse once, and the focus should return to the page. Now, using the down
   arrow key to move the focus to the text box, try to cycle though the text
   boxes until the focus returns back to the page again. The Activate event does
   not trigger.
