TITLE   :XCLN: Memory Problems After Printing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:Windows:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you print from the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client you may encounter
insufficient memory problems when you use other conventional- memory-intensive
applications.

CAUSE
=====

Some conventional memory used by the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client when
printing may not be relinquished even after you quit the client by clicking Exit
and Logoff. The amount of conventional memory lost can vary between 30 KB and 80
KB, depending on the printer driver used.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem you should try to conserve conventional memory in
general and use a printer driver that minimizes the use of conventional memory.
Methods for general conservation of conventional memory include running the
Memmaker.exe utility to optimize the availability of conventional memory at the
MS-DOS level and using a standard VGA video driver instead of Super VGA or other
high-resolution video drivers.


STATUS
======

3.x client version 4.0. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully
