SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document to a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 2 from Microsoft Excel
versions 5.0 or 7.0 or PowerPoint, the first page will print fine, but
subsequent pages may never print. The job gets stuck in Print Manager with a
status of spooling. No error code appears on the printer and the application has
already finished composing the job, so the application is unaware of any
problem. This happens when printing locally on a Windows NT Workstation or
Windows NT Server with Service Pack 5 installed.

-or-

When you print across the network to a LaserJet Series II attached to a Windows
NT 3.51 Server or Workstation with Service Pack 5 installed.



RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the hotfix mentioned in this article.
