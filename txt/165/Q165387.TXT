PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

SYMPTOMS
========

When you uncompress a directory structure on an NTFS volume and you quit the
process for any reason (such as corrupt file or out of free space), you will
receive a sharing violation when trying to delete the directory structure. The
sharing violation always occurs in the directory of the last file accessed when
you quit the uncompression process.


CAUSE
=====

This is caused because Explorer.exe (Windows NT 4.0 shell) keeps an open handle
to the directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform either of the following steps:

 - Log off the computer and log back on, which should clear the handle. You
   should now be able to delete the directory.

   -or-

 - Restart your system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
