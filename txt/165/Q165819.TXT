SUMMARY
=======

You are running Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS on a computer running MS-DOS
from a diskless workstation (for example, you start the computer with a disk in
drive A), and you receive the following error message during startup:

   Error 3 -- The specified path could not be found. An error occurred accessing
   the Security-Settings file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the System.ini file on the disk for entries that reference drive C, in
particular lanroot= in the [network] section and devdir= in the [network
drivers] section. Change these references to reflect drive A instead of drive C.
Save the file and restart the computer with the disk in the drive.
