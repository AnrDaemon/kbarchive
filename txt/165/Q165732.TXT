PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW), you may see the
following error message:

   The specified local group already exists

If you click OK, you will return to the FPNW volume setup options.

CAUSE
=====

The above error occurs because Windows NT includes a group called Supervisor,
and FPNW attempts to create a Local user account called Supervisor as part of
its installation. Windows NT does not allow a username to be the same as a
groupname.

RESOLUTION
==========

In order to install FPNW, you must remove the Supervisor group.
