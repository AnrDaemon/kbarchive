PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui kbusage word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When applying borders to multiple paragraphs to which you have

 - included an inside border (a border between paragraphs)

   -and-

 - set a distance from text for the Bottom border,

the distance from text is not applied to the inside border--although the preview
for From Text (Border and Shading Options) indicates the specified distance from
the text will be applied.

WORKAROUND
==========

To achieve the same result as setting a distance from text for borders between
paragraphs, apply separate borders to each paragraph and set the top and bottom
space for the From Text value to the desired distance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For a group of selected paragraphs, you can set a top, bottom, left, right, and
a between border. For top, bottom, left, and right borders, you can specify the
distance from text. However, you cannot set a distance from text for the border
between paragraphs.
