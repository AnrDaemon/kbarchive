PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The CREATEOFFLINE command opens the parent table exclusively regardless of the
exclusive setting.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the parent table is not currently open, open the parent table shared before
issuing the CREATEOFFLINE command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In a multiuser environment where more than one work station is accessing tables,
CREATEOFFLINE will open a table exclusively regardless of the setting of
exclusive, and other users will not be able to open that table. They will get
the message [ASCII 147]File Access is denied.[ASCII 148]

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code to create a new subdirectory with a new database that
   contains a view of the customer table.

         SET DEFAULT TO HOME()
         OPEN DATABASE HOME()+"\samples\data\testdata"
         MKDIR offview
         SET DEFAULT TO HOME()+"offview"
         CREATE DATABASE OFFDBC
         CREATE SQL VIEW mycustomer AS SELECT * ;
            FROM HOME()+"\samples\data\customer"

2. Run the following code to make the view off line.

         CLOSE ALL
         CLEAR
         SET EXCLUSIVE OFF
         SET MULTILOCKS ON
         OPEN DATABASE Home()+"\samples\data\testdata"
         SET DEFAULT TO HOME()+"offview"
         OPEN DATABASE offdbc
         ?CREATEOFFLINE("mycustomer")
         SET

3. In the Data Session window, select customer. Notice that the status bar shows
   that customer is opened exclusively.

4. Run the following code to put mycustomer back online.

         CLOSE ALL
         CLEAR
         SET EXCLUSIVE OFF
         SET MULTILOCKS ON
         SET DEFAULT TO HOME()+"offview"
         OPEN DATABASE offdbc
         IF DBGETPROP("mycustomer","view","offline")
            ?DROPOFFLINE("mycustomer")
         ENDIF
