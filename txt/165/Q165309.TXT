======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE Libraries, used with:
    - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If client "A" initializes COM, then client "B" starts and makes a remote COM
call, an attempt by Client "A" to make a secure remote COM call fails with error
RPC_E_NO_GOOD_SECURITY_PACKAGES.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because security information is not being synchronized
properly if, when it is time to launch Rpcss.exe in a client, COM finds that it
has already been launched.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this problem by pre-launching Rpcss.exe before launching the
client process. A convenient place to do this is in the registry at
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run (launches when the shell
loads) or \RunServices (launches immediately upon machine boot, that is, before
login). Add a named value (any name) and a value of "RPCSS.EXE".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This was corrected for DCOM on Windows 95 in build number 518.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: There are other reasons a client application may not be able to
communicate with a remote object.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q165300 BUG: Remote COM Calls Fail Because RPCSS Is Not Started

You can determine whether an observed failure is caused by failure to synchronize
security information by manually starting RPCSS before launching the client
process that failed.
