TITLE   :GetPeerName() Returns WSAENOTCONN After Select() Returns Success
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbProgramming kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an application that uses sockets and then perform the following in
this application, GetPeerName returns WSAENOTCONN.

1. Issue the Connect() call in NonBlocking mode.

2. Since Connect() returns asynchronously, issue the Select() call which should
   return when the Connect() completes.

3. After the Select() returns, issue the GetPeerName() call which retrieves the
   name of the peer to which a socket is connected.

CAUSE
=====

A timing problem allows Select(); to return before Connect();.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, put a Sleep(0) after the Select() function call.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
