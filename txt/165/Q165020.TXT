SUMMARY
=======

MFC-based ActiveX controls capture mouse input by calling SetCapture in response
to a mouse-button message. This can cause unexpected problems, but the behavior
is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you need to perform an action in response to a mouse button message when
implementing an ActiveX control, and that action involves the use of the mouse
(for example, displaying a message box or modal dialog box), you need to perform
the action after the call to the base class implementation of the handler.
Performing such actions prior to calling the base class may result in mouse
capture problems.

Sample Code
-----------

      void CMyButton::OnLButtonDown(UINT nFlags, CPoint point)
      {
          // Handle default first so that the mouse capture is resolved.
          COleControl::OnLButtonDown(nFlags, point);

          // Then, add your own hander code afterwards.
          MessageBox(_T("No more problem!"));
      }
