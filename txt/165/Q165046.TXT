SUMMARY
=======

You cannot view a hidden user's schedule even if you are given permissions,
unless you have created a Personal Address Book (PAB) entry for the hidden user.
This is by product design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view a hidden user's Schedule+ information, the Exchange administrator must
un-hide the mailbox from the Global Address List (GAL). Then, users must create
a PAB entry for the hidden user. Once there is a PAB entry for the hidden user's
mailbox that needs to be viewed, the mailbox can be re-hidden by the Exchange
administrator. The hidden user will have to grant permissions as normal for you
to see their Schedule+ information.

To do this, administrators should follow these steps:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, select the hidden
   recipient, and from the Advanced property page, uncheck the Hide from Address
   Book option.

2. Tell the users to add this address to their PAB by starting their client
   and:

   a. Selecting Address Book from the Tools Menu.

   b. Opening the Global Address List.

   c. Selecting the user that you intend to hide.

   d. From the File menu, selecting Add to Personal Address Book.

3. Repeat step 2 for all users who may need to open the hidden user's Schedule.

4. From the Administrator program, select the user you want to hide from the
   recipient container and from the Advanced property page, check the Hide from
   Address Book option.
