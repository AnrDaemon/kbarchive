TITLE   :Connection for Downstream PU Fails to Reactivate After Outage
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A downstream connection fails to activate after an outage even though both
stations are ready.

CAUSE
=====

If SNA Server received a reactivation XID while it was processing the outage, it
would set the link in a state from which it could not reactivate. The connection
would have to be manually reset for it to reactivate.

NOTE: This article is related to the following Knowledge Base article, which
documents a similar (but not identical) issue for SNA Server version 2.11:

   Q150472 Downstream PU Fails to Reactivate After an Outage

RESOLUTION
==========

The components have been instructed to not pass reactivation XIDs to the server
component until it has finished processing the outage.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
