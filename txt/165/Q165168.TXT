======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Top-Level menu appears in a Top-Level form that calls a modal form with the
system menu set off, closing the modal form causes the Top-Level form menu to
disappear.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in Visual FoxPro
5.0a for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Top-Level menu using the Menu Builder. Select General Options from
   the View menu, and then select "Top-Level Form" in the resulting dialog box.
   Name the menu "Ztop" (without the quotation marks).

2. Create a modal form called Zmodal and set the following properties:

         ShowWindow = 1-In Top-Level Form
         WindowType = 1-Modal

3. Create a Top-Level form called Ztopform and set the following properties:

         ShowWindow = 2-As Top-Level Form

4. In the DblClick Event of the Ztopform form, place the following code:

         DO Form Zmodal

5. In the Init of the Ztopform form, place the following code:

         DO Ztop.mpr WITH THISFORM,.T.

6. Close the form and type the following in the Command window:

         SET SYSMENU OFF

7. Run the Ztopform and double-click the form to invoke the modal form.

8. Close the modal form. In Visual FoxPro 5.0, the menu on the Top-Level form
   disappears.
