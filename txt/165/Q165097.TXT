SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the WordBasic.ToolsCalculate command in a Visual Basic for
Applications macro, the result returned may be incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

The following WordBasic.ToolsCalculate command will return a value of
342999999999.999 to the variable, Result$.

      Result$ = WordBasic.ToolsCalculate("7000 ^ 3")

The correct result is 343000000000.

When you use Visual Basic for Applications, you do not need to use the
ToolsCalculate command to perform exponential calculations. The following
function performs the same calculation but returns the correct result of
343000000000 to the integer variable, iResult.

      Sub Result()
         Dim iResult As Double
         iResult = 7000 ^ 3
      End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
