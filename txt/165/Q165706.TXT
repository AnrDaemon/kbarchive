TITLE   :MacFile Volume Icon Changes after Permissions Are Changed

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you mount a Windows NT shared volume from a Macintosh client, you may see a
generic file icon instead of a standard Windows NT Connected Drive icon on the
desktop.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This can be caused by assigning LIST permissions to the logon user or group used
by the client to mount the shared volume. By default, LIST uses the following
NTFS permissions:

   Special Directory Access:
   READ    (R)
   EXECUTE (E)

   Special File Access:
   N/A

To resolve the problem, modify the NTFS permissions to allow the user group to
have READ access on the volume. This change would provide the following
permissions:

   Special Directory Access:
   READ    (R)
   EXECUTE (E)

   Special File Access:
   READ    (R)
   EXECUTE (E)
