TITLE   :Windows 3.x App Can't Find SNA Server When Started Second Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An SNA Server Windows 3.x application (for example, the 3270 applet) can't
connect to SNA Server over TCP/IP sockets or IPX/SPX when started a second time.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur on a Windows for Workgroups (WFW) 3.11 client if WFW
password caching is disabled and an old cached password file containing the
incorrect password still exists for the user.

The SNA Server Windows 3.x client (Wnap.exe) attempts to use a cached WFW
password, if one exists on the computer, instead of sending a NULL password set
by the user in the SNA client logon dialog.


RESOLUTION
==========

A fix to SNA Server 3.0 is available for this problem.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
