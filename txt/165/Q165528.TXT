PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbautotext word97 kbnumbering

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install the Contemporary Press Report template (Contprel.dot) from the
Value Pack or Web site and then click on Template in the Style Gallery, you will
receive the following message when you click the Example preview radio button:

   There is no example for this template

CAUSE
=====

The Word 97 template Contemporary Press Release (Contprel.dot) that ships as
part of the Value Pack is missing the Gallery Example AutoText entry. The other
two optional Press Release templates, Professional Press Release (Profprel.dot)
and Elegant Press Release (Elegprel.dot), both contain the Gallery Example
AutoText entry.

The Style Gallery uses the Gallery Example AutoText for the Example preview.
Without it, you will not have an Example preview available.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can create a Gallery Example AutoText entry for the template by following
these steps:

1. Open the Contemporary Press Release (Contprel.dot) template.

2. On the Edit menu, click Select All.

3. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and click AutoText.

4. In the "Look in" list, click CONTPREL (Template).

5. For the AutoText name, type "Gallery Example" (without the quotation marks),
   and click Add.

6. Save and Close the template.

You will now have a preview when you go to the Style Gallery, click the template
and click the Example preview choice.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

"Gallery Example" is a special AutoText entry that the Style Gallery displays
when you choose the Example preview. "Gallery Style Samples" is a special
AutoText entry that the Style Gallery displays when you choose the Style Samples
preview.
