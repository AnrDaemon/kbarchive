TITLE   :PPT7: Text Behind Object Prints w/ Some HP Printer Drivers
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbdta

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you place text behind an object to facilitate a build, the text behind the
object may appear on the printout, even though you cannot see it on the screen.

NOTE: This symptom also occurs in other programs that allow you to place a text
object behind another object.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if you are using one of the following printer drivers for
Windows 95:

   HP LaserJet II
   HP LaserJet III
   HP LaserJet IIIsi
   HP LaserJet 4
   HP LaserJet 4 Plus
   HP LaserJet 4M Plus
   Printers compatible with any of the above

These printers use various versions of the Hewlett-Packard Printer Control
Language (HPPCL). In HPPCL, text is printed on the page first and then graphics
are overlaid on top of the text. If the graphic is not entirely opaque, the text
shows through.

RESOLUTION
==========

To print your file so that the text remains hidden behind the object, use one of
the following methods.

Method 1: Use the Print TrueType As Graphics Option
---------------------------------------------------

This method is effective for printing TrueType fonts to the LaserJet series II
and III printers.

The LaserJet 4 printer treats many of the common Windows TrueType fonts (such as
Arial, Courier New, Times New Roman, and WingDings) as built-in fonts. If your
text uses one of these fonts, and you are using a LaserJet 4 driver, this
solution does not work.

1. On the File menu, click Print.

2. Click Properties.

3. Click the Fonts tab.

4. Click the Print TrueType As Graphics option, and then click OK.

5. Click OK.

Method 2: Use the PostScript Page Description Language
------------------------------------------------------

This method is effective when printing any font to a printer that supports the
Adobe PostScript page description language in addition to HPPCL. The LaserJet
IIIsi and 4si printers have built-in support for the Adobe PostScript language.
Other printers may support this language if you install a PostScript option (an
add-on card or cartridge). Make sure your printer supports PostScript before you
use this method!

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Double-click the Add A Printer icon.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen to install a printer driver from the
   following list that matches your printer model:

   HP LaserJet IIIsi PS
   HP LaserJet 4 PS
   HP LaserJet 4 PS
   HP LaserJet 4si PS
   HP LaserJet 4 Plus PS
   HP LaserJet 4M Plus PS

4. Print your presentation using this driver.
