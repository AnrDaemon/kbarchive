MORE INFORMATION
================

Database Designer
-----------------

You can print a database diagram on any printer that supports raster graphics.
Diagrams print at the current zoom level. If you want to enlarge or reduce your
diagram, select a different zoom setting.

To print a database diagram:

1. On the File menu, click Print.

2. In the Print dialog box, select a printer from the Name list set any of the
   other available print options. For information about each option, click
   What's This in the top-right corner of the dialog box, and then click the
   field that you want to see information about.

3. Click OK.

The tables and relationships that appear in your diagram will print exactly as
shown on the screen with one exception--all of the tables in your diagram appear
in their selected state in your printout for better contrast.

Query Designer
--------------

You can update data in the Results pane of the Query Designer if:

 - The primary key column(s) have been included in your query for output.

   CAUTION: If a table in your query uses a compound key (more than one column is
   used to make up the unique key for each row), you must include all parts of
   the key in the query. If the result set does not include all columns required
   for the compound key, any updates that you make in the Results pane might
   change more than one row in the table without warning.

 - The ODBC driver for the data source that you are querying against supports
   SQLPrimaryKeys(). Such drivers include Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft
   Access, Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 3.0 and later, and Oracle.

Installation Issues
-------------------

You must install the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 1 or later to run the
Database Designer. For best performance, we recommend Service Pack 2.

Handling Communication and TDS Protocol Errors in Microsoft SQL Server
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can get a TDS Protocol error or a Communications Link Failure when you're
working against Microsoft SQL Server under certain conditions, including running
SQL Trace against the server.

If such a problem occurs, right-click the data connection in Data View and choose
Refresh from the shortcut menu. If you find that the problem is caused by SQL
Trace, close SQL Trace and then refresh the connection.
