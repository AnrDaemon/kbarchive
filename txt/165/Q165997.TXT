-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you access server-side Include files (.stm), you may receive one of the
following error messages:

   Requested header was not found

   -OR-

   Internet Explorer cannot open http://%path%/.stm

CAUSE
=====

This can occur if the IUSR_Computername account does not have proper Windows
NTFS permissions set (read/execute) for the Ssinc.dll file. This dll file is
responsible for processing server-side Include files (.stm). By default, it is
located in the %Winnt%\System32\Inetsrv directory.

NOTE: The location of your Ssinc.dll file may be different than the one specified
above.

WORKAROUND

Apply the appropriate permissions (read/execute) to the Ssinc.dll file.
