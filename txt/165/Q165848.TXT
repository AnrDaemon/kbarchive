TITLE   :Barr Channel Link Doesn't Support the Distribute Option
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When viewing the properties of the Barr channel link service within SNA Server
Manager, the link service is missing the following check box option:

   Allow Link Service to be Distributed

This prevents the link service from being used as a distributed link.

CAUSE
=====

The Barr channel link service setup script was missing the distributed link
option. Also, the link service itself had a separate problem which prevented the
link service from working after adding this option.


RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available for the Barr channel link service to
support distributed operation. However, the Barr channel link service property
page still does not include the check box to enable distributed operation. To do
this, follow these configuration steps:

1. Add the Barr channel link service using SNA Server Manager.

2. Run External Link Services from the SNA Manager Tools menu.

3. Click Links, focus on the Barr S/370 Channel Link Service, and then click the
   DISTRIBUTE button.

The link service name will now begin with "[D]" to indicate that the link has
been distributed.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
