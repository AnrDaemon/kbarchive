TITLE   :Opening Manager Takes Long Time with Many LU Pools Configured
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience a long response time when opening SNA Server Manager,
depending on how many LU Pools are configured.


CAUSE
=====

The mechanism used by SNA Server Manager to insert all the pool items into a
tree was causing Manager to open slowly when a large number of LU Pools were
defined.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server Manager was updated to use a Lazy Tree mechanism for inserting pool
items into a tree, which resulted in better response time when opening Manager.
To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
