KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help
topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you attempt to reapply a hotfix
that is more recent than the service pack after you reapply the service pack:

   Hotfix: The fix is already installed.
   Hotfix: Internal consistency error: Invalid Tree pointer = <garbage
   characters displayed>.

If you then try to remove the hotfix by using the /R switch, you may receive the
following error message:

   Hotfix: Fix <"hotfix name"> was not removed.

CAUSE
=====

Hotfix.exe checks the Hotfix key in the registry to determine if the hotfix
being applied has already been installed.

When you remove a hotfix using the /R switch, Hotfix.exe checks the New Link Date
key stored in the Hotfix key in the registry. If the link date of the current
file listed in the New File key is older than the date contained in the New Link
Date key, then Hotfix.exe does not remove the file and replace it with the
original file stored in the %SystemRoot%\Hotfix folder on your hard disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you apply a hotfix, Hotfix.exe adds a registry value that indicates the
hotfix has been applied. Perform the following steps to successfully reapply the
hotfix after reapplying the service pack:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\ 
   CurrentVersion\Hotfix

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

2. Select the hotfix key you wish to delete, and then click Delete on the Edit
   menu.

3. Reinstall all applicable hotfixes.
