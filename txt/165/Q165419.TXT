TITLE   :FIX: SQL Debugger Displays Incorrect Value for Float Variables
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbEEdition kbVC kbVC500bug kbVC600fixkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The value of FLOAT variables inside the SQL Debugger is displayed incorrectly
for any value other than zero.

For example, a float that you expect to contain the value 1.1 is displayed as the
value 4.6508221013814e-104.


RESOLUTION
==========

This only effects the display of FLOAT values. Modify the values of FLOAT
variables with the debugger and the changes will be made correctly.

To workaround this, you can assign the value of the FLOAT variable to a

   CHAR variable and examine the CHAR variable in the debugger. For example:

      DECLARE @floatVar FLOAT
      DECLARE @strVar CHAR (10)

      SELECT @floatVar = 1.1
      SELECT @strVar = CONVERT ( CHAR(10), @floatVar )

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0
for Windows.
