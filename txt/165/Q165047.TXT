TITLE   :Get_TP_Properties Returns Incorrectly If Conversation Started
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a remote node sends SNA Server an Attach (FMH-5) for conversation, the
Receive_Allocate() and the Get_TP_Properties() complete successfully, but the
field containing the Local LU contains the Partner LU name. This causes the
Get_TP_Properties() to return the wrong status for this LU.

CAUSE
=====

The APPC library extracts the Local Fully Qualified (FQ) LU name from the
Logical-Unit-of-Work-Identifier (LUWID) in the Attach (FMH-5), rather than using
a stored copy of the Local LU Name and Network name to reconstruct the Fully
Qualified (FQ) LU name. While this works correctly for conversations started
locally, it does not work for remotely initiated conversations where the LUWID
contains the partner Fully Qualified (FQ) LU name.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix is available to correct this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
