TITLE   :Internal Tracing for 32-bit CPI-C Applications Not Available
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Internal tracing of 32-bit CPI-C applications is not available when running the
CPI-C application on an SNA Server, SNA Workstation, or Windows NT SNA Server
client.

NOTE: Internal traces for SNA Server components are typically run at the request
of Microsoft Technical Support.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server has always had SNADMOD internal tracing for SNA Applications that
use any of the SNA Server's supported APIs. These internal traces are used to
diagnose problem between the client-server interface. SNA Server hasn't
supported internal tracing within the CPI-C DLL itself, which would allow the
diagnosis of logic-related problems within the handling of the CPI-C API.

RESOLUTION
==========

The 32-bit CPI-C libraries for SNA Server 3.0 have been updated to include
support for internal tracing within the CPI-C DLL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
