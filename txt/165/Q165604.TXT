TITLE   :WD97: WordBasic Object Returns Incorrect ASCII Number For Symbol
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbmacro kbwordvba

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The value returned for a symbol character in a WordBasic macro is different from
the value returned for the same symbol when you convert the WordBasic macro into
a Visual Basic for Applications macro.

For example, the WordBasic macro returns a value of 183 for a bullet character in
the Symbol font, but the Visual Basic for Applications macro returns the value
of 63 for the same character and font.

CAUSE
=====

Characters in the Symbol font are stored in Unicode. The value used is a subset
of Unicode character mapping.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about returning character values, while in the Visual Basic
for Applications Editor click the Office Assistant, type "Asc" (without the
quotation marks), click Search, and then click to view "ASC Function."

For more information about Unicode, visit the Unicode Web site at:

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Visual Basic Help is not installed on your
