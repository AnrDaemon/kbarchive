PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardwarekbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Some of the scan codes on the Compaq financial keyboard do not work in a Windows
NT virtual machine.

CAUSE
=====

The numeric keypad of the Compaq financial keyboard is different than the keypad
on a typical 101 or 102 key enhanced keyboard. For example, the scan code 0x7c
cannot be used from a terminate and stay resident (TSR) application via
Interrupt 9. This is because of the way the scan code sets were defined in a
Windows NT virtual machine.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in
