-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MORE INFORMATION
================

To obtain more information on the scripting functionality and scripting
languages available to you, please contact your Internet Service Provider.

SYMPTOMS
========

The Web Page Wizard includes three forms (Feedback, Registration, and Survey)
for submitting responses. When you set the Action for the Submit button to an
e-mail address, a question mark is included in your e-mail address. For example,
if the action you specified for the Submit control is:

   Mail To: YourE-mailName

the following will appear in the To box of the e-mail message when you click the
Submit button:

   YourE-mailName?

CAUSE
=====

The question mark signifies that the control does not know what to do with the
value submitted. The Submit button requires a scripting language such as CGI or
VBScript. In addition, the scripting language you are able to use (CGI, Perl, or
VBScript) is dependent upon your Internet Service Provider.
