SYMPTOMS
========

When a Novell NetWare Client computer logs on to a NetWare 4.x server, the login
script could fail to map certain drive mappings that are preceded by IF MEMBER
OF. This condition will mainly happen when the user is a member of enough NDS
groups such that the group list is bigger than 2048 bytes.

CAUSE
=====

A buffer was not initialized to a size large enough to contain the entire group
list.


RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the hotfix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
