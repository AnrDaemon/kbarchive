TITLE   :NTbackup on Spanish NT 4.0 Will Not Use Command-line Switches
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Ntbackup.exe from the Spanish-language version of Windows NT 4.0
with command-line parameters specified in the Backup.hlp file, you will receive
an "Invalid Parameter" (translated) error message.

CAUSE
=====

In the Backup.hlp file, the operation parameters (BACKUP or EJECT) are shown in
English. However, Ntbackup.exe was localized to accept the Spanish-language
equivalent of the words BACKUP and EJECT.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ntbackup.exe in Spanish Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 or later corrects this
problem. NTBACKUP now accepts the documented English-language command-line
parameters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Spanish Windows NT version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 4.0 Spanish Service Pack.
