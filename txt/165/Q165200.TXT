TITLE   :Network Transports Options Not Available on RISC Systems
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Network Transports check boxes are not available in the Server Configuration
dialog box within SNA Server Manager on RISC-based SNA Server systems.

To display the Network Transports options, do the following:

1. Right-click on SNA Server in SNA Server Manager.

2. Select Properties on the menu.

3. Click the Server Configuration tab on the Server Properties dialog box.

4. Click the Change button.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Configuration property page was dynamically loading Snarpcsv.dll
and doing a GetProcAddr() call using a decorated name. This call failed on
RISC-based SNA Server systems.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server Manager was updated to correct this problem on RISC-based systems.


The updated module is:

   <Snaroot>\System\Snapage.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
