TITLE   :Windows NT Does Not Detect Serial IntelliPoint Mouse
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you replace an existing serial mouse with a Microsoft Mouse Port mouse
connected to a serial adapter, the driver tab in Control Panel shows the mouse
as "Unknown" and the Change button is unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT cannot detect the mouse type properly through the serial adapter.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A serial adapter is a device that permits a Mouse Port mouse to be used from a
serial port.

To determine if your mouse is using such an adapter, examine the connection to
the computer. A Mouse Port mouse has a round plug on the end of the cable. If
your mouse has such a plug and is plugged into another connector that is not
round, your mouse is using a serial adapter.
