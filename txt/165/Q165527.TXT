KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbusage kbnumbering

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your document contains more than 8 levels of numbering, then your numbering
may be incorrect after you save the document as HTML.

CAUSE
=====

The HTML conversion process only supports eight levels of numbering, while Word
supports up to nine.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use Internet Explorer 3.0 or later to view the HTML document. The HTML that is
written when you save from Word as HTML is correct. The numbering problem is a
limitation to the HTML import process when opening the HTML document in Word.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
