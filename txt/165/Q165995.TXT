TITLE   :Valid User Fails to Authenticate with NT Challenge/Response
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:Winnt:2.0,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have set IIS to use the Microsoft Windows NT Challenge/Response (NTCR), a
valid user may not be able to successfully logon to IIS and will be prompted
three times for his or her username and password. Then the user will get the
following error message:

   Access is denied.

CAUSE
=====

By design, Windows NT Challenge/Response is supposed to pass the user's
credentials to IIS and then be validated by the IIS server. If the user has been
granted permission, the page will be accessed. If the user has NOT been granted
permission, IIS will return the above error message.

It should NOT return an authentication box. However, this may occur when the
client is on the same subnet as the IIS server. When IIS challenges the client,
the client thinks it should have access even if IIS is set to NTCR, and it pops
up an authentication box. The credentials will show the following:

   Resource:
   Username:
   Password:

NOTE: The resource will be blank because NTCR failed.

With Basic authentication type enabled, you would see the resource that you are
trying to access. If you try and put in any credentials that are valid, it will
fail except for the administrator/administrators of that IIS server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To successfully be authenticated all the time, set the authentication type to
Basic in Internet Service Manager, WWW properties. As a result, the client will
be able to retrieve the correct resource no matter where it resides, and if the
user is valid with Logon Locally Rights, he or she will gain access to the IIS
server.
