TITLE   :Addusers Errors & Bad File Output When Using Incorrect Version
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to output a list of users through the Addusers resource kit
utility, it is possible that you will repeatedly receive the following message:

   User account <username> saved to file!

The resulting file can be very large for the number of accounts originally
exported (for example, a 1 MB file results for only five user accounts
processed).

When you attempt to import a list of users from a previously created user dump
file, it is possible that the following error could repeatedly appear:

   Error 2224 - Username "<username>" not added

A normal export should look similar to the following:

   [User]
   Administrator,,,Build-in account for administering the
   computer/domain,,,,
   Guest,,,Build-in account for guest access to the computer/domain
   <Userid1>,,,,,,
   <Userid2>,,,,,,
   <Userid3>,,,,,,
   <Userid4>,,,,,,
   [Global]
   Domain Admins,Designated administrators of the domain,Administrator,
   Domain Guests,All domain guests,Guests,
   Domain Users,All domain users,<userid>,etc.,
   [Local]
   Account Operators,Members can administer domain user and group accounts,
   Administrators,Members can fully administer the computer/domain,
   Backup Operators,Member can bypass file security to back up files,
   Guests,Users granted guest access to the computer/domain,
   Print Operators,Members can administer domain printers,
   Server Operators,Members can administer domain servers,
   Users,Ordinary users, Replicator,Directory Replication,

Output from a wrong version of Addusers.exe will produce something similar to the
following:

   User Name,Full Name,Password,Comment,Home Drive,Home Path,Profile,Script
   Administrator,,,Built-in account for administering the computer/domain,
   Guest,,,Built-in account for guest access to the computer/domain,
   <Userid1>,
   <Userid2>,
   <Userid3>,
   <Userid4>,
   <Userid1>,
   <Userid2>,
   <Userid3>,
   <Userid4>,
   <Userid1>,
   ...etc.

There will be no section names for [User], [Global], and [Local].

MORE INFORMATION
================

The preceding error messages and export file result if you attempt to use a
version of Addusers.exe from the Windows NT Resource Kit on a version of Windows
NT different than the one on which your computer is running (in other words, if
you use Addusers.exe from the Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit on a computer running
Windows NT version 4.0 or Addusers.exe from the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit on a
computer running Windows NT version 3.51).

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the version of Addusers.exe compiled for the intended platform.
