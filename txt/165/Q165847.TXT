 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Open Subdomain feature in SNA Manager for selecting either an SNA
Server subdomain or Windows NT domain, you can type up to 15 characters, however
only 14 characters are accepted.

CAUSE

A problem was found in the way SNA Manager handled this request.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Manager now accepts 17 characters, and validates that it is less than 16
characters if no leading "\" (backslash) is present.

A fix to SNA Server 3.0 is available for this problem.

problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
