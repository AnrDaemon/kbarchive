TITLE   :SNA Server Manager Traps When Assigning 5000 Pools to a User
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An application exception in SNA Server Manager (Snaexp.exe) occurs when 5000 LU
pools are assigned to one user. A Drwtsn32.log is generated in the Windows NT
directory when the application exception occurs.

CAUSE
=====

The addition of the 4,329th LU pool to a user record in SNA Server version 3.0
causes the user record's length to grow beyond 64 KB, causing the application
exception to occur when the configuration is being written.

RESOLUTION
==========

The limit on the number of pools that may be assigned to a user has been set at
4000.

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. The following file
has been updated:

   <Snaroot>\System\Snacfg.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
