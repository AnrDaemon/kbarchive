SYMPTOMS
========

1. SNA Server Did Not Support the Local LU Syncpoint Option

   SYMPTOMS

   SNACFG does not support "Use Client/Server Encryption" flag for Local APPC
   LUs.

   RESOLUTION

   A fix is available to correct this problem. The syntax is:

   SNACFG [#configpath] User <username> /add /syncpoint: yes | no

   It also works with /print.


2. "Use Client/Server Encryption" Not Supported Using /Print Option

   SYMPTOMS

   The following command does not display the "Use Client/Server Encryption" flag
   for users or user groups:

   SNACFG [#configpath] User <username> /Print

   RESOLUTION A fix is available to correct this problem.


3. Session Level Security Settings Not Supported

   SYMPTOMS

   SNACFG does not support the APPCRLU session-level security options.

   RESOLUTION

   A fix is available to correct this problem. The following is the syntax:

   SNACFG APPCRLU /SECURITY:{ None,text | Hex,text | Char,text }

   It also works with /print.


4. MaxSendRU is Displayed Three Times When Using Mode Option

   SYMPTOMS

   The following command will display the MaxSendRU value three times in error:

   c:> snacfg mode <modename> /print

   RESOLUTION A fix is available to correct this problem.


5. Deleting User Without DomainName May Delete Wrong User

   SYMPTOMS

   Snacfg.exe allows the deletion of users without specifying the domainname. The
   following command deletes the first user named Fred that it finds:

   c:> snacfg user Fred /delete

   RESOLUTION A fix is available to correct this problem.


6. SNACFG Connection Command Problems

   SYMPTOMS

   When using the connection option of SNACFG, you have the following results:

    - The XID parameter is not output by /PRINT.

    - If a connection is set to use XID0, restoring the config via SNACFG will
      set it to XID3.

    - The remote end parameter is not preserved. The /PRINT converts peer to
      host. After restoring the config, downstream is converted to peer.

   RESOLUTION A fix is available to correct this problem.


7. SNACFG Doesn't Support Different LOCAL Network Name and Control Point Name
   for Each Connection

   SYMPTOMS

   SNACFG doesn't support different LOCAL Network Name and Control Point Name for
   each connection.

   RESOLUTION

   A fix is available to correct this problem.

   The following command allows a Local Network Name and Control Point Name to be
   added for each connection:

   c:> snacfg [#configpath] connection <connectionname> /netname
   /cpname
