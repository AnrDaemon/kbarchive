SYMPTOMS
========

When you close a document protected for forms, you receive the error:

   Run-time error '4605': Command not available

After receiving the error, you cannot close or save your document.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you:

 - Create a document and protect it for Forms (click Protect Document on the
   Tools menu).

   -and-

 - While the protected document is open, create a Web page using the Web Page
   Wizard.

If you close the Web page you just created and attempt to save or close the
protected document, the error will occur and you will be unable to save or close
the protected document. Also, the UnProtect menu command is missing from the
Tools menu.

This problem occurs because the underlying template add-in, Html.dot, for the Web
Page Wizard is still active and all menu commands reflect the menus of the
Html.dot template. When you choose one of the menu commands, such as Close on
the File menu, a call is made to the Html.wll add-in. Because the Web Page has
been closed, the call fails.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, create and run the following macro:

The following macro unprotects the active document, removes the HTML.Dot as an
Add-In and then re-protects the active document.

      Sub RestoreMenus()
         Dim sDefPath As String
         ' Unprotect the document.
         If ActiveDocument.ProtectionType <> wdNoProtection Then
            ActiveDocument.Unprotect
         End If
         ' Remove the HTML.Dot as an add-in.
         ' (To restore the default menus.)
         sDefPath = Options.DefaultFilePath(Path:=wdProgramPath)
         AddIns(sDefPath & "\HTML.Dot").Installed = False
         ' Reprotect the document preserving form field contents.
         If ActiveDocument.ProtectionType = wdNoProtection Then
            ActiveDocument.Protect Type:=wdAllowOnlyFormFields, NoReset:=True
         End If
      End Sub
