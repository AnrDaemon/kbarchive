TITLE   :File Errors from 16-bit OLE Applications
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may encounter one or more of the following "File Error" error messages when
you attempt to run a 16-bit Windows OLE application:

   File Error
   Cannot find file OLE2.DLL

   File Error
   Cannot find file STORAGE.DLL

   File Error
   Cannot find file COMPOBJ.DLL

   File Error
   Cannot find file OLE2DIST.DLL

NOTE: Depending on the application, these errors might vary.

CAUSE
=====

The files are either missing or are in the %SystemRoot%\System directory instead
of the %SystemRoot%\System32 directory.

Most DLL files for 16-bit Windows applications are located, by default, in the
SYSTEM directory. The OLE DLL files for 16-bit Windows applications, however,
are located, by default, in the SYSTEM32 directory because they are thunked by
the operating system using their 32-bit counterparts (that is, the 32-bit
counterpart for Ole2.dll is Ole32.dll).


RESOLUTION
==========

Search your system partition for all of the OLE DLL files referenced in the
error(s) you are receiving. If they do not exist on the system partition, then
re-expand them from the Windows NT source media into the %SystemRoot%\System32
directory. If they exist elsewhere on the system partition (for example, in
%SystemRoot%\System), move them into the %SystemRoot%\System32 directory and
restart your application.

NOTE: If you have a service pack for Windows NT installed at the time you perform
one of the procedures outlined above, it is advisable to reapply the service
pack following the procedure because there may be an updated version of one or
more of these files.
