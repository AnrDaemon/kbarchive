======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Form fields can not be edited in Word Viewer 97-2000. When you try to change a
text box form field, you get the error message:

   Word Viewer cannot edit a document.

NOTE: Check box and drop-down form fields function normally. Note also that this
behavior is different from Word Viewer for Windows 95 version 7.0.

CAUSE
=====

This functionality is by design. Word Viewer is only for viewing and printing
Word documents. To edit a document, you must use Microsoft Word.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have Microsoft Word installed on your computer, you can edit the document
in Word. In Word Viewer 97-2000, on the File menu, click Open for Editing.

This starts Microsoft Word, loads the document, and allows you to make changes.
