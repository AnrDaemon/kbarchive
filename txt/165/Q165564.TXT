-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you delete or change a numbered or bulleted list when Track Changes is on,
you may receive unexpected results.

Case 1
------

If you delete a numbered list item with Track Changes on, the revised text is
struck through and appears with the number followed immediately by the text
without any indentation.

Case 2
------

If you delete a bulleted list item with Track Changes on, the revised text is
struck-through and appears with a square (instead of the bullet) followed
immediately by the text without the indentation.

Case 3
------

If you change a number or bullet format to a Wingding bullet format with Track
Changes on, the revised text is struck-through and appears with one or two
random struck-through Wingding characters preceding your actual bullet.

NOTE: This behavior is different from earlier versions of Word.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you undo the change or if you accept or reject the change, Word corrects

the problem and shows the text with the bullet or number properly.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design of Microsoft Word.
