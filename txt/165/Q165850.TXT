TITLE   :SNA Print Service Drops Escape Sequences from 3270 Print Job
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Escape sequences from 3270 print jobs were dropped, causing incorrect print
formatting or printer control data to be sent to the printer.

CAUSE
=====

If a custom transparency byte is configured for a 3270 print session under the
Transparency/GDI folder in SNA Server Manager, and the Custom Byte check box is
later cleared, the SNA Print Service was still using the custom transparency
byte even though none was configured.

This caused the SNA Print Service to drop this byte from the 3270 print job.

RESOLUTION
==========

It is possible to work around this problem by clicking to select the Custom Byte
check box and setting the Decimal Value to 00.

A fix for SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem. To resolve this
problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
