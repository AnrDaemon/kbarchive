SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot use the "What's This?" feature in a text box.

NOTE: This behavior is different from Microsoft Word 6.x and 7.x for Windows 95.

"What's This?" feature.

1. Click the text box to show the handles around the edges of the text box.

2. On the Format menu, click Text Box.

3. On the Text Box tab, click "Convert to Frame."

NOTE: After you convert your text box to a frame, you can't convert the frame
back to a text box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Word displays text as it will look when printed and doesn't use formatting codes
to indicate formatting. To easily check document formatting, Word provides a
tool for viewing how text is formatted, called "What's This?"

To check the formats of a particular character or paragraph, click "What's This?"
on the Help menu (or press SHIFT+F1). When the insertion point becomes a
question mark, click the text you want to check. When you finish checking your
text, press ESC.

For more information about "What's This?", click the Office Assistant, type "How
do I check format settings," click Search, and then click to view "About viewing
format settings."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer, please
