SYMPTOMS
========

This code works in Visual Basic 3.0:

        If Form1.Text1.Text = "" & Form1.Text2.Text = "" Then...

but fails in Visual Basic 4.0 and later with a "type mismatch" error.

The correct syntax for this statement is:

        If Form1.Text1.Text = "" And Form1.Text2.Text = "" Then...

Confusing the concatenation operator "&" with the logical operator "AND" will
result in "type mismatch errors."

CAUSE
=====

This is a result of the data type of (Boolean) being added to Visual Basic 4.0
and later.

RESOLUTION
==========

When performing logical comparisons between operands, be sure to use the logical
operators (AND, OR) as opposed to the concatenation operator "&" in Visual
Basic 4.0.

STATUS
======

This is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Visual Basic 3.0, a logical comparison between operands would result in
either a 1 or a 0 being returned. With Visual Basic 4.0 and later, a logical
data type has been added so that a logical comparison between two operands will
result in either a "TRUE" or "FALSE" value being returned. Attempting to use the
concatenation operator "&" can not be performed in Visual Basic 4.0 and
later on these logical data types. Therefore, an error is raised.
