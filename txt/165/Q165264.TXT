SUMMARY
=======

You can install the Systems Management Server client software to a specific disk
drive by using the /d: switch on the cli_<operating system> line (for
example, Cli_dos.exe) in the Smsls or Runsms batch files. For more information,
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q127072 Installing SMS Client to Drive Other Than Most Free Disk Space

However, if that switch is mistakenly used on the inv<operating system>
line (for example, Invdos.exe) in the Smsls or Runsms batch files, the client
reports an incomplete inventory. Therefore, some icons will be missing from the
Personal Computer Properties in the Systems Management Server Administrator
program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent this problem from occurring, do not use the /d: switch on the
inv<operating system> line.
