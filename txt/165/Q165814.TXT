TITLE   :Stop: 0x0000001E When Opening My Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience the following blue screen when you double-click My Computer
or Network Neighborhood and you are using McAfee's NetShield or VirusScan:

   STOP: 0x0000001E (0xC0000005,0x801113F7,0x000000000,0x00000008)

The second parameter in the Stop code may be different depending on your system
configuration.

CAUSE
=====

A problem with the Windows NT 4.0 system file Fs_rec.sys can cause Windows NT to
try to load the CD file system (CDFS) when it is already loaded. This in turn
causes the virus scan program to initialize another instance of internal
structures, which cause Windows NT to blue screen with the above error when
called.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in
