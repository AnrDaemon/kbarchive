TITLE   :WD97: Bullets and Numbering Not Aligned in Document Map
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbusage kbnumbering

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Paragraphs that are formatted with bullets and numbering formatting appear to be
misaligned in the Document Map. These paragraphs appear to be aligned correctly
in other views, such as normal view or page layout view. This problem is
especially apparent if you are using the Windows NT version 3.51 operating
system.

CAUSE
=====

The Document Map pane uses a space to separate the bullet or number from the
paragraph text. Other views use a tab.

The Document Map pane does not use a tab for the bullet or number alignment
because the tab stop would have to be able to accommodate varying fonts and
sizes. This could consume a large amount of space in the Document Map pane, and
could make it difficult to read the text in the Document Map.
