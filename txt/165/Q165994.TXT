======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for Windows 1996 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you double-click a title to start playing a film clip, the insertion point
changes to an hourglass and then changes back to a cursor.

The film clip does not play, nor is there an error message displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem will occur if the entry:

   avi=AVIVideo

found in the [mci extensions] section of the WIN.INI file, is missing or is
spelled incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, make sure the line is entered in the [mci extensions]
section of the Win.ini file, as follows:

   avi=AVIVideo

If this line is not in your Win.ini file, add it.

For more information about modifying .ini files in Windows, see your Windows
printed documentation or online help.
