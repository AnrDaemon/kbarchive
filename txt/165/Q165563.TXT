SUMMARY
=======

CDaoRecordset::GetRecordCount is not guaranteed to return the correct number of
rows for a table-type recordset even if you call this function after calling
MoveLast().

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can call CDaoRecordset::GetRecordCount to find out how many records in a
recordset have been accessed. GetRecordCount does not indicate how many records
are contained in a dynaset-type or snapshot-type recordset until all records
have been accessed. To force the last record to be accessed, call the MoveLast
function.

The value of GetRecordCount from a table-type recordset reflects the approximate
number of records in the table.


To get an accurate record count, open a dynaset- or snapshot-type recordset and
then do a MoveLast. Table-type recordsets will be accurate immediately after the
database has been compacted or repaired.
