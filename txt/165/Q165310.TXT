TITLE   :5250 Print Sessions Don't Reconnect After Connection Outage
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

5250 print sessions defined under the Host Print service for SNA Server 3.0 stay
in an Inactive state after the SNA Server connection to the AS/400 recovers from
a connection outage. This occurs even though the 5250 print sessions are
configured for Automatic activation in SNA Server Manager.

This problem will occur even if the connection outage is caused by a planned
outage, such as an AS/400 IPL.

SNA Server Manager will show that the connection to the AS/400 has been
reactivated via the normal retry algorithm of SNA Server, but the 5250 print
sessions are still Inactive.

CAUSE
=====

5250 print sessions do not try to reestablish the APPC conversation after the
APPC conversation was terminated by a connection outage.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is to manually start the 5250 print sessions after a connection
outage has occurred.

The Host Print service has been updated so that 5250 print sessions will try to
reactivate the APPC conversation using configurable parameters that set the
number of retry attempts and the retry interval between attempts. These two
parameters are configurable via the following registry parameters

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
      \SnaPrint\Parameters\ActivationRetryLimit: REG_DWORD: <limit>

where: <limit> is the number of retries. The default value is -1
(infinite), if this parameter is not set.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
      \SnaPrint\Parameters\ActivationRetryInterval: REG_DWORD: <interval>

where <interval> is the retry interval in seconds. The default value is 10
seconds, if this parameter is not set. The updated module is:

   <Snaroot>\System\Ppd5250.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
