TITLE   :SNA 3.0 Setup Fails If Computer Name Starts with a Digit
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install SNA Server 3.0 on a computer whose name contains a number as the
first character, Setup completes successfully. However, when you first run SNA
Server Manager, no SNA Servers are listed in the Manager. Also, if you close the
Manager at that point, you will get a Dr. Watson error in Snaexp.exe. However,
the DrWtsn32.log file will not show a fault (which would tell you which module
actually caused the access violation).

CAUSE
=====

This is a regression for a problem that was corrected in SNA Server 2.11 Service
Pack 1.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
