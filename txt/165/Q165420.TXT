TITLE   :FIX: SQL Breakpoint Not Hit After Executing SP in Another DB
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode kbProgramming kbDebug kbEEdition kbSQLServ kbVC kbVC500bug kbVC600fixkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SQL Debugger may fail to stop at breakpoints that are set after a call to a
stored procedure from a database (other than the current one) is executed.

CAUSE
=====

The call to the stored procedure in the secondary database changes the context
of SQL Server to that database.

The SQL Debugger cannot find breakpoints that were set in the context of the
previous database and fails to break on them.

RESOLUTION
==========

Work around this by placing a call to a stored procedure that resides in the
same database as the stored procedure you were initially debugging.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0
for Windows.

Sample Code
-----------

      /* Sample SP which shows the problem */ 
      Create Procedure sp_MySP
      As
      SELECT * FROM employee

      /* Breakpoints set after this call will not be hit */ 
      EXEC OtherDB.dbo.sp_SomeSP

      SELECT * FROM Authors

      RETURN (0)

      -----------
      /* Sample SP with a workaround */ 
      /* Add one line of code */ 

      Create Procedure sp_MySP
      As
      SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE

      EXEC OtherDB.dbo.sp_SomeSP

      /* This causes the database context to be changed back to original */ 
      /* Breakpoints will now be hit */ 
      EXEC sp_MySP2

      SELECT * FROM Authors

      RETURN (0)

      /* Stored procedure called from above */ 

      Create Procedure sp_MySP2
      As
      RETURN (0)
