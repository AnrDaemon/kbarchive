SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a ListNum field into a document and then apply a heading style
to a paragraph before the ListNum field, the result of the ListNum field will be
demoted one numbering level below the heading level you applied (rather than
retaining the numbering level that was applied when the ListNum field was
inserted).

WORKAROUND
==========

Manually promote or demote the ListNum field to the numbering level you want,
using one of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

1. Position the insertion point inside the ListNum field.

2. Click the Increase Indent button on the Formatting toolbar to promote the
   value of the ListNum field to a higher numbering level, or click the Decrease
   Indent button on the Formatting toolbar to demote the value of the ListNum
   field to a lower numbering level.

NOTE: You can also right-click the ListNum field and click the Increase Indent or
Decrease indent button on the shortcut menu.

Method 2
--------

1. Turn on the field codes by pressing ALT+F9 on the keyboard if the field codes
   are not already visible.

2. Modify the number in the ListNum field that is immediately after the \l
   switch to indicate the numbering level you want. For example, a ListNum field
   formatted for numbering level two would appear as {LISTNUM \l 2}, and a
   ListNum field formatted for numbering level three would appear as {LISTNUM \l
   3}.

3. Press ALT+F9 on the keyboard to toggle the field codes off.

4. Update the field by clicking on the field and pressing F9 on the keyboard.
