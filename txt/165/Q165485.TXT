TITLE   :XFOR: MS Mail Connector requires a PRMD field in Site Addressing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After the Microsoft Mail Connector Interchange (MSMI) has been started, the
following events may be repeated continuously in the event log, and messages are
not transferred through the Microsoft Mail Connector.

   Event  2335         Source    MSExchangeMSMI
   Type   Information  Category  Session Data
   MS Mail Connector Interchange has established an MTA session for
   downloading messages from the Exchange server.

   Event 2380          Source    MSExchangeMSMI
   Type  Error         Category  Session Error
   A memory access violation has occurred that prevents further processing
   of a message. The access violation that occurred is an attempt to read
   from 0x4. Please refer to the immediately following event(s) logged by
   MS Mail Connector Interchange for more information on the message that
   could not be processed.

Another symptom may be failure during installation of the MSMail Connector. The
following error:

   The MS Mail Connector failed to install properly.

may be followed by:

   An internal processing error has occurred: constraint violation. The
   value specified for an attribute is either too big, too small, or not
   valid. Microsoft Exchange Directory ID no: DS_E_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION.

CAUSE
=====

The MSMI requires a value in the PRMD (Private Resource Management Domain) field
to operate correctly. If the X.400 Site Addressing value has a blank PRMD, the
above symptoms will occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Set a "dummy" value in the PRMD field for the X.400 Site Addressing.

2. Even with a PRMD value set in the Site Addressing field, users need not have
   a PRMD defined in their X.400 Proxy. Modify the X.400 proxy addresses either
   manually or by using the Directory Import/Export program.

For more information on using Directory Import/Export, please see the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
