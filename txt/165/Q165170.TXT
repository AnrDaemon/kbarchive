The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you do not know the TCP/IP address of your Windows NT machine, you can
determine it quickly by bringing up an MS-DOS Window and typing IPCONFIG at the
prompt. On a Windows 95 machine, type WINIPCFG at the Start/Run prompt.

Information similar to the following appears:

   Windows NT IP Configuration

   Ethernet adapter IEEPRO1:

      IP Address. . . . . . . . . : 157.54.53.197

      Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . : 255.255.240.0

      Default Gateway . . . . . . : 157.54.48.1

The Windows 95 machine displays a Window titled IP Configuration with the above
information, in addition to some information on your network adapter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This information is sometimes necessary when setting up a Remote OLE Automation
Server. When running Clireg32.exe on the client machine, the "network address"
field requires either the machine name or the TCP/IP address of the server.
