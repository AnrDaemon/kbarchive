TITLE   :WD97: Outlook Item Pasted as Text into Word or WordMail
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you paste an Outlook item into Word or a WordMail message, you get the text
of the item header and not an embedded Outlook item object.

NOTE: This functions correctly when you paste an Outlook item into an Outlook
message (not using WordMail).

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 Clipboard does not support the functionality necessary to embed
Outlook items into Word or WordMail.

WORKAROUND
==========

To embed the Outlook item as an object in Word, use the following steps:

1. Select the item in Outlook.

   For example, select a message from the Outlook inbox. Do not open the Outlook
   message.

2. Click and hold the mouse button, drag the item to Word or a WordMail message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

In Outlook, an item is the basic element that holds information (similar to a
file in other programs). Items include mail messages, appointments, contacts,
tasks, journal entries, and notes.
