The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Repair Disk Utility may return the following errors:

   Repair Disk Utility could not save all configuration files when using the
   Update Repair Info option.

-or-

When you run RDISK with the -s parameter, no errors are displayed on the computer
screen or entered into the event log. The Create Emergency Repair Disk option is
not displayed, and the progress bar may be updated much faster than normal, (For
example, in two seconds instead of one minute).

CAUSE
=====

Possible causes of these errors include:

 - Insufficient access permissions to the %SystemRoot%\repair directory (you
   should have at least change permission: read, write, change, delete).

 - The file %SystemRoot%\Profiles\Default User\Ntuser.dat is inaccessible.

 - The drive containing the directory %SystemRoot%\repair lacks free space to
   hold the configuration files.
