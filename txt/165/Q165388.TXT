TITLE   :Invalid Directory Returned When Attempting to Access FPNW
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 4.00 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

NETX clients may receive the following error when attempting to change to a
subdirectory on a File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) volume:

   Invalid Directory

CAUSE
=====

This error was caused by not impersonating the user on a call to open a
directory for searching when it was a relative open (relative to the root
directory open for the share). The fix was to impersonate the user before doing
the open of the directory.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
