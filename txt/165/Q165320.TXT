TITLE   :Shared Folder Gateway Hangs Getting Directory Listing
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to get a directory list from a shared folder, the computer may
stop responding (hang) after you issue the "dir" command.

CAUSE
=====

If GetDirectoryInformation is called with a file index larger than the actual
number of files in the directory, the FindNthFile() function goes into an
infinite loop.

RESOLUTION
==========

The FindNthFile() function has been modified to prevent the infinite loop.

The following modules have been updated:

   <Snaroot>\System\Sfgw.exe

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
