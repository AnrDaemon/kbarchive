TITLE   :SMS: PCMWin32 Should Ignore Mandatory Background Jobs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcmkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a Workstation package that has "System (Background) Task" enabled
with a Run Command on Workstation job, the Package Command Manager (PCM)
executable (Pcmwin32.exe) fails to ignore the background job and runs it. The
PCMWin32 executable should not run this package, and should not display a window
with an option to run the job.

The "System (Background) Task" option is used to identify a package command line
that will be run only by the PCM service (Pcmsvc32.exe). If this option is
enabled, and the Run Command on Workstation job has a mandatory time defined,
only the PCM service should run the package.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
