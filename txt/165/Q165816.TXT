TITLE   :STOP 0x0000000A in HAL.DLL on Multiprocessor Computers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows NT on a multiprocessor computer under heavy stress, you may
receive the following STOP message:

   STOP 0x0000000A (0x00000000, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0x80150810)

The exact address where the STOP occurs may vary, but it is always in the
hardware abstraction layer (HAL.)

CAUSE
=====

This STOP message is caused by a timing problem in the kernel that occurs when
two processes are executing that are operating on the same memory structures,
such as multiple disk reads or writes. Due to a compiler optimization that
caused two operations to be executed in the wrong order, one of the processes
attempts to use a pointer it thinks has been initialized correctly, when in fact
it has not.

This error can only occur on a multiprocessor computer and has been observed most
frequently on NCR multiprocessor systems, however it could occur on any
multiprocessor computer.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
