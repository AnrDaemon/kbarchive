TITLE   :CSNW Clients May Get Access Denied Using WHOAMI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) users may not be able to get connection
information using the WHOAMI tool. If the user is not an administrator of his or
her workstation and he or she selects WHOAMI from the Network Neighborhood menu,
he or she will receive the following error message:

   Error access is denied occurred while trying to get connection information.

CAUSE
=====

CSNW attempted to open a handle directly to the NetWare redirector device.
Because only an administrator, or the system account, can acquire a handle
directly to the NetWare redirector device, the open would fail and access is
denied.

RESOLUTION
==========

CSNW was modified to get a handle to the preferred, or nearest, server instead
of the NetWare redirector device.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. A
supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should be
applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information.
