TITLE   :3270 Applet Resets Session and Returns to Host Signon Screen
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After connecting to a specific host application, the 3270 applet resets the
session and returns to the host logon screen. When this occurs, the 3270 applet
reports sense code 0813 (Bracket Bid Reject), followed by sense code 1003
(Function Not Supported).

CAUSE
=====

The host sends data to the 3270 applet after the user has started typing. The
applet correctly rejects the data with sense code 0813. The host continues to
send after SNA Server has sent the negative response. instead of passing the
second set of data up to the applet, SNA Server converts it into an exception
response (EXR) message with the sense code 2003 (Bracket Error).

The applet should be responding with the same sense code (0813), however, the
applet is incorrectly treating the EXR message as a normal request, causing the
applet to incorrectly respond with sense code 1003. This causes the session to
end.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem. To resolve
this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.


STATUS
======
