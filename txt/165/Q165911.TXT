TITLE   :SNA Manager Support for "Assigned To" Column for 3270 LUs
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Using SNA Manager, it's not possible to determine which specific 3270 LUs have
been assigned to users and which have not been assigned. This makes it difficult
to avoid assignment of the same 3270 LU to multiple users.

NOTE: This problem only applies to assignment of specific 3270 LUs to users. If a
pooled 3270 LU is assigned to a user or group, the user automatically accesses
the next available 3270 LU from the pool, so conflicts do not occur.

CAUSE
=====

There is no mechanism in SNA Manager to identify 3270 LUs which have not been
assigned to users.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem. The update
adds a new Assigned To column in SNA Server Manager for 3270 LUs. This option is
selected by default, causing the Assigned To column to appear in any SNA Manager
window where 3270 LUs are displayed.

To customize which columns should be displayed by SNA Server Manager, focus on
the connection status and click View/Columns.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
