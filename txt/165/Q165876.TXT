3. In Systems Management Server Setup, click Operations and then click Reset
   Site.

   service.

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server

MORE INFORMATION
----------------

The PREINST /UPGRADE:xxx (where xxx is the site code) command can be used to
upgrade a secondary site when the new switch /NOAUTOUPGRADE has been used to
upgrade the Systems Management Server primary site (for Systems Management
Server 1.2 only).

If the site code used is the site code of the primary site itself, the site runs
a "self deinstallation."
