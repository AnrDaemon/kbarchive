SYMPTOMS
========

If the Account Policy for a domain requires a unique password and you try to
change your password on a client computer that has support for case sensitive
passwords, changes in case may not count as a unique password.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a Windows NT-based computer negotiates a session with a Windows NT-based
domain controller, it sets flags that show that it can support case-sensitive
passwords. This means there is case distinction of passwords, for example, you
can change your password from "password" to "PassWord".

Down-level clients (such as Microsoft Windows for Workgroups and Microsoft
Windows 95) do not support case-sensitive passwords. Because of this, when a
password is set on the domain, two copies of it are stored. If the password is
set from a down-level client, both passwords stored are the same. However, if
the password is set by a client with support for case-sensitive passwords, the
case-specific password is stored along with a case-insensitive password. By
doing so, you can set a case-sensitive password and still be able to logon from
a down-level client.

When password uniqueness is checked, it compares the password it is given to the
case-insensitive password. This limits you to actual character changes when you
make a unique password.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a limitation in Windows NT.
