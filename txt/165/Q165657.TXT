TITLE   :RUI_BID Response Is Not Recognized by RUI Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP2,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP2, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An RUI application receives an RUI_BID response from the node in an FMI- STATUS
message rather than a data message. As a consequence, the application does not
recognize or expect the RUI_BID response.

CAUSE
=====

The node was not checking whether messages were FMIDATA before checking the
segmentation bits of the request unit (RU).

This problem was inadvertently introduced in SNA Server version 2.11 Service Pack
2 as the result of an unrelated fix.


To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11 Service
Pack 2 and 3.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
