TITLE   :IIS Does Not Allow its TCP Port to Be Same as SSL Port
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Certificate and commit the
changes, and you stop and restart the WWW service, you may get the following
error message:

   Winsock Error: Address already in use

NOTE: This error message will also appear when you run the QBIK Wingate Engine
(as Service). This service is similar to Dialup Networking.

CAUSE
=====

Because the SSL binding is the newly installed key to port 443 and does not
allow anything else to use that specific port, the TCP port on IIS cannot use
the same port as the SSL port.

Notes:

 - Some other Web Servers do allow a shared port, for example, Netscape
   Enterprise Server 2.0.

 - 443 is only an example port.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

Use the following steps to check to see if the ports are the same:

1. In Internet Service Manager, go to WWW Properties and check TCP port value.

2. Open Regedit or Regedt32 and go to following location:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\Parameters

3. Select the SecurePort key and get value in parenthesis (for example, 443).

4. Check the two numbers (IIS TCP port and SecurePort) and verify that they are
   not the same. If they are duplicated, change the TCP port value in Internet
   Service Manager to port 90 or any other port that is not in use.

   This will correct this Winsock error and should allow IIS to be restarted
   again.

NOTE: To do this you must first make a backup of your key and then remove it from
key manager. IIS will not restart until this has been done because SSL still has
control of the port so the port value cannot be changed.
