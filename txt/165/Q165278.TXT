TITLE   :3270/5250 Print Jobs Generate an Extra Form Feed
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Host or AS/400 print jobs that are printed through the SNA Server 3.0 Host Print
service, may generate an extra form feed at the end of the print job.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server 3.0 Host Print service calls the EndDos API to close to a print
session when printing transparent data. The EndDos API always appends a form
feed character to the print job even if the Host Print service sent a form feed
as part of the transparent data.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Host Print service for SNA Server 3.0 has been updated to use new APIs that
do not append a form feed character when closing the print session. The new APIs
are StartDocPrinter, WritePrinter, and EndDocPrinter. The EndDos API is no
longer used by the Host Print service.

The following modules have been updated:

   <Snaroot>\System\Ppd3270.dll
   <Snaroot>\System\Winvprt.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
