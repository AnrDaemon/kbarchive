KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbusage word97 kbnumbering

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you save a Word document containing bullets in Text With Layout format, when
you open the Text With Layout document, the bullets will have changed to other
characters.

CAUSE
=====

The preset bullet characters are being incorrectly mapped to different extended
ANSI characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

Save the document as Text Only rather than as Text With Layout.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you save the document as Text Only, the bullet characters get mapped to
either small dots or asterisks. This is the correct behavior. If you save the
document as Text With Layout, the bullet characters get mapped to different,
incorrect ANSI extended characters.
