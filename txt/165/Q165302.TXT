SYMPTOMS
========

If you have Outline Numbering applied to a Word 97 document and you format page
breaks, section breaks, or column breaks as a heading style, then when you open
the file in Word 7.0, Heading Numbering may be incorrectly applied to the breaks
instead of the text near the breaks.

CAUSE
=====

This is a limitation in the Word 7.0 heading numbering feature.

WORKAROUND
==========

Format the break with a different style, such as Normal.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Word 7.0, there are some situations where a break formatted with a heading
style takes on heading numbering. This problem was corrected in Word 97;
however, when you save as Word 6.0 from Word 97 and then open the file in Word
7.0, the heading numbering may be incorrectly applied to the breaks.
