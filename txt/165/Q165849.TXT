TITLE   :SNA Manager Improvements When Many 3270 LUs Are Configured
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server Manager performance is slow when there are a large number of 3270 LUs
configured. Also, if the connection or active users window is not being viewed,
the client session counts may be incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server Manager was recounting active sessions when a 3270 LU was opened or
closed. Also, if 3270 LUs aren't viewed in Manager, status information wasn't
being received for these LUs, causing client session counting to be incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem. To resolve
this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

The session counting is now done on the server in a thread which activates every
15 seconds. It sends updated counts to Manager if counts have changed. This
means that session count updates in Manager may be delayed by as much as 15
seconds.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
