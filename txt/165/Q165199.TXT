TITLE   :SNA Server Services Stay in Stopping State
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After stopping the SNA Server service, the status will show "Stopping," but will
never change to an "Inactive" state.

NOTE: This problem has been seen when stopping the TN5250 Service, however other
services may be affected as well.

CAUSE
=====

This can happen when the SNA Server service terminates before sending the last
status change message to the SNA Server Manage Agent service. The Manage Agent
sets the status of extension services to inactive, if the service process
terminates correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Changes were made to the SNA Server Manage Agent to correct this problem. To
resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
