SUMMARY
=======

CMiniFrameWnd::Create member function lets you create the Windows mini- frame
window and attach it to the CMiniFrameWnd object. Create initializes the
window's class name and window name and registers default values for its style
and parent.

The CMiniFrameWnd::Create function has the following prototype:

MFS_MOVEFRAME     Allows the mini-frame window to be moved by clicking
                  on any edge of the window, not just the caption.

MFS_4THICKFRAME   Disables resizing of the mini-frame window.

MFS_SYNCACTIVE    Synchronizes the activation of the mini-frame window
                  to the activation of its parent window.

MFS_THICKFRAME    Allows the mini-frame window to be sized as small as
                  the contents of the client area allow.

MFS_BLOCKSYSMENU  Blocks any hit testing on system menu.

The Visual C++ 6.0 online documentation for CMiniFrameWnd::Create() does list the MFS_BLOCKSYSMENU style.
