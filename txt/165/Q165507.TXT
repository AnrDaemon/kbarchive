TITLE   :SMS: PGC Randomly Picks a Logon Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In some WAN environments, Systems Management Server's Program Group Control
(PGC) may go across the WAN to attempt a connection to a Systems Management
Server logon server (domain controller) to obtain the groups a logged on user
belongs to.

This may cause unwanted delays, due to the slow connection speed, and also may
use important WAN connection bandwidth.

CAUSE
=====

The PGC randomly chooses a Systems Management Server logon server in the domain
(primary domain controller and backup domain controllers) to retrieve the
information.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been fixed in Systems Management Server 1.2. The PGC first
attempts to locate the server listed in the ValidatingServer entry in the
[SMSLSIni] section of the Sms.ini file, as in the following example:

      [SMSLSIni]
      ValidatingServer=\\xxxxx

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been fixed in Systems Management Server version
1.2.
