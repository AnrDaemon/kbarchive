TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Install CSNW with "Attended=Yes" in Unattend.txt Fil
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot install Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) during an unattended Setup
with "Attended=Yes" in the [Network] section of the Unattend.txt file.

CAUSE
=====

Installation of CSNW during an unattended Setup requires the InstallServices
entry in the [Network] section of the Unattend.txt file. When you add the
"Attended=Yes" line to install network components interactively, Setup ignores
all entries in the [Network] section. The Setup Wizard for installing the
network components that is started at this time does not prompt you to install
additional services.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here In the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT Workstation 4.0 unattended Setup runs a Typical Setup. Network
options are available only during a Custom Setup. At this time there are no
settings to force Setup to perform a Custom Setup.
