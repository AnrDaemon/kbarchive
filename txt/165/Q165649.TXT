TITLE   :Pooling Of Local APPC LUs Not Functioning Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Clients fail to obtain a 5250 session when configured to use the default pool of
Local APPC LUs if all of the sessions on the last Local APPC LU are in use.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server fails to provide a session from the next LU in the default outgoing
Local APPC LU Pool. SNA Server will provide sessions starting with the last LU
in the pool. When this LU has reached its session limit, it should start
providing sessions from the next LU on the list.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix was made to the SNA Server service to resolve this problem. Obtain the
hotfix mentioned below.

The updated files are:

   Wappc32.dll
   Snaservr.exe
   Trcservr.exe

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
