TITLE   :ODE97: Using Undo Create to Delete Page Removes Tab Control
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
 - Microsoft Access 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a new Tab control on a form in Microsoft Access 97, clicking the
Undo Create command on the Edit menu will cause the following behavior to
occur:

 - If you insert a new object on the Tab control, such as a text box or a label,
   the Undo Create command will delete the newly created object.

 - If you insert a new page on the Tab control, the Undo Create command will
   delete the entire Tab control.

CAUSE
=====

The Undo Create command can only be used to delete new objects that have been
inserted on the Tab control or the form. It cannot be used to delete new pages
that you add to the Tab control.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to delete a new page from a Tab control, click the Delete command on
the Edit menu or the Delete Page command on the Tab Control shortcut menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create a Tab control on your form, you can use the Undo Create command
on the Edit menu to delete new objects that you insert on the control, delete
new objects that you add to the form, or delete the Tab control itself. However,
if you want to delete a new page that you have added to the Tab control, you
must use the Delete command.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open the sample database Northwind.mdb in Microsoft Access 97.

2. Create a form and insert a Tab control on the form.

3. Add a text box to the Tab control.

4. On the Edit menu, click Undo Create. The text box is deleted from the Tab
   control.

5. On the Insert menu, click Tab Control Page. This inserts a new page for the
   Tab control.

6. On the Edit menu, click Undo Create. Note that the entire Tab control is
   removed.
