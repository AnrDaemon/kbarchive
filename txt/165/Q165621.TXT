======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5 
 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, versions 2.0, 3.0 
 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG #: 16328 (2.65.0240)

SYMPTOMS
========

In a multi-threaded application that has two threads, when the first thread does
a SQLExecDirect of a select statement and the second thread does a SQLCancel in
the middle of the select, the driver does not get a response back from the
server, and therefore closes the connection.

The following error is reported by the Net-Library:

   Error 231: ConnectionTransact (GetOverLappedResult()).

The SQL Server driver then reports the following error:

   szSqlState = "08S01", *pfNativeError = 0, *pcbErrorMsg = 61
   szErrorMsg = "[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Communication link failure"

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server driver
version 2.65. This problem has been corrected in U.S. Service Pack 3 for
Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5. For more information, contact your primary
support provider.
