SYMPTOMS
========

When you have a Visual Basic for Applications macro that uses the BreakLink
method in combination with an object reference, the following error message may
appear:

   Run-time error '5825': Object has been deleted

CAUSE
=====

The link the object variable referred to no longer exists.

You receive the "Object has been deleted" message if the macro has attempted to
access an object that has been deleted. The object may have been deleted
deliberately, such as with the Delete method, or it may have been deleted as a
side effect of another operation, such as when a frame is added around an inline
shape, which deletes the original inline shape and creates a copy of it in the
frame.

WORKAROUND
==========

To verify that an object still exists, use the IsObjectValid method. The
following example demonstrates the use of this method.

      Sub testObject()
         Dim sPIC As InlineShape
         Set sPIC = ActiveDocument.InlineShapes.Add("C:\Windows\bubbles.bmp")
         MsgBox IsObjectValid(sPIC)     ' This will display True
         sPIC.Delete
         MsgBox IsObjectValid(sPIC)     ' This will display False
      End Sub

For more information about IsObjectValid, click the Office Assistant while in the
Visual Basic Editor, type "IsObjectValid" (without the quotation marks), click
Search, and then click to view "IsObjectValid Property."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
