TITLE   :XCLN: Messages Dragged from Client to Desktop Overlap
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,8.01; Win95:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows 95, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you move multiple messages from Microsoft Exchange Client or Outlook to the
Windows NT or Windows 95 desktop using a drag-and-drop operation, the moved or
copied messages appear on top of one another on the desktop. Also, during the
copy operation, while the cursor is over the Exchange Client window, it appears
as the "normal select" cursor and not a "busy" or "working in background"
cursor.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is currently no means of changing the behavior of the cursor during the
copy/move operation. To prevent copied messages from overlapping on the
desktop:

 - Using a drag-and-drop operation, manually arrange the messages.

-OR-

 - Have Windows NT or Windows 95 arrange the messages for you; right-click the
   open desktop, select Arrange Icons, and then select one of the available
   commands (by Name, by Type, Auto Arrange, and so on).

NOTE: This problem does not occur when you move messages to a folder on the
desktop. In this case, the folder arranges the messages according to whatever
properties have been set on the folder.
