TITLE   :WD97: Outline Numbering Links to All Styles After Style Copy
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbusage kbnumbering

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a numbering scheme that links to several heading styles and then
copy a few of those heading styles to a new document or template using the
Organizer, all of the heading style links will be copied to the new document or
template rather than just the heading style links pertaining to the heading
styles that were copied.

CAUSE
=====

The Numbering dialog box is showing incorrect information.

WORKAROUND
==========

To break the heading style numbering links so that only the links related to the
heading styles that were copied are available, follow these steps:

1. Open the document or template that you copied the heading styles to.

2. Position the insertion point in a paragraph that is formatted with a heading
   style.

3. On the Format menu, click Bullets And Numbering.

4. Click Customize, and then click OK.

5. Undo the numbering by pressing CTRL+Z on the keyboard (or, on the Edit menu,
   click Undo).

This breaks the numbering links to styles that were not copied over to the
document or template.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem has been corrected in Word 2000.
