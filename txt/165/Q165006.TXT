SUMMARY
=======

DHCP logs the following Event in Event Viewer:

   1020   Type         Warning              Source       DhcpServer

In this case, the scope aaa.bbb.ccc.0 is 80 percent used. This Event is provided
to alert the DHCP Server administrator that their scope is close to becoming
fully used, so that they can take action before running out of addresses.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is no means to customize this threshold for this event through the
registry because a value of 80% is hardcoded. There may be higher percentages
displayed because the check against this value happens only when the DHCP
database is scavenged.


Additional query words: customize threshold registry
