TITLE   :XADM: Error Message Applying Service Pack on Alpha Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbtshoot

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs when you attempt to apply a Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0
Service Pack to a Digital Alpha server running the Digital Alpha version of
Windows NT Server. When you run the Update.exe program, the following error
message may appear:

   Could not open file named c:\Exchsrvr\bin\Address.dll.

When you click OK the following error message appears:

   Could not open the file named c:\Exchsrvr\Xxx.xxx"

where Xxx.xxx is the name of a file to be copied from the Service Pack Setup
directory to the Exchsrvr directory. This happens with every file that is
supposed to be copied from the Service Pack Setup directory to the Exchsrvr
directory.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if the Digital Equipment FX!32 Intel emulation
Service is running on the Exchange Server computer that the Exchange Server
Service Pack is being installed on.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Stop the FX!32 Service before you attempt to apply any Exchange Server
   Service Packs. After the Exchange Service Pack has been applied the FX!32
   service can be restarted.

   If stopping the service doesn't keep the error from recurring, remove the
   FX!32 service from the system and restart the server. Then, install the
   service packs and reinstall the FX!32 service.

MORE INFORMATION
================
