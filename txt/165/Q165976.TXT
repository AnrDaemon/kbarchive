SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a Visual Basic for Applications macro that applies the default color
for borders and shading, and it then applies a border, the new default color may
not be applied to the border.

The following example Visual Basic for Applications macro demonstrates this
problem:

      Sub BorderParagraph()
         Documents.Add
         With Options
            .DefaultBorderColorIndex = wdRed
            .DefaultBorderLineStyle = wdLineStyleDouble
         End With
         ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Borders.Enable = True
      End Sub

WORKAROUND
==========

The following example Visual Basic for Applications macro code can be used as a
workaround to set the specified border color and to apply the border to the
specified paragraph:

      Sub BorderParagraph()
         With Selection.Paragraphs.Borders
            .Enable = True
            .OutsideColorIndex = wdRed
            .OutsideLineStyle = wdLineStyleDouble
         End With
      End Sub
