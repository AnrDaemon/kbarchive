TITLE   :Odbc.inf File in ODBC Folder Prevents Use of Drvstp32.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Drvstp32.exe program included in the ODBC driver directory does not set up
the driver properly over an existing installation of the ODBC driver.
Furthermore, it does not produce reliable results on a new setup.

CAUSE
=====

The Odbc.inf file in the ODBC directories for both the Windows NT and Windows 95
clients, has information for a much older release of the StarSQL ODBC driver.
The Drvstp32.exe program depends on the Odbc.inf file for proper setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use SNA Server setup to remove and reinstall the ODBC components.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
