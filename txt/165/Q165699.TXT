TITLE   :SMS_WORKING_DIR Environment Variable Ignored on Win16 Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible to set an MS-DOS environment variable, SMS_WORKING_DIR, that can
be used to point a shared application to a default working directory. However,
this variable is ignored by shared applications on Win16 clients. As a result,
when a user clicks Open on a shared application's File menu, the default
directory is the distribution server's package share.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
