      was not delivered to:
      <network>/<PO>/<User ID>

A non-delivery report (NDR) is generated and sent to the originator of the

to match the address against the directory.

RESOLUTION

To resolve this problem:

 - Check for the existence of duplicate addresses in the Exchange Server Global
   Address List (GAL); to do this, on the Tools menu, click Find Recipients and
   search in the Exchange GAL. Delete duplicate addresses.
