KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SUMMARY
=======

When you create a custom application using the Microsoft Office 97 Professional
Edition Tools (ODE) Setup Wizard, some files are automatically copied to your
disk images. These are considered to be the core files for your custom
application. These files enable to run Microsoft Access on another computer
without the retail version.

Any other files that are added to the disk images are added so that they can
accompany all other options you select in the Setup Wizard.

For example, if you add the Microsoft Excel ISAM component to your custom
application, the Setup Wizard will add the files needed for that component to
your disk images.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This article lists the files that are automatically copied to your disk images
and the additional files that are added when you add files to the Add Files page
or you add components on the Redistributable components page of the Setup
Wizard.

The following files are added automatically to the disk images created by the
Setup Wizard program when you add the Microsoft Access run-time version and
