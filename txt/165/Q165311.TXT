TITLE   :SNA Server 3.0 Windows 95 Clients Hang when Using Encryption
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 SNA Server 3.0 clients appear to stop responding (hang) when they are
trying to connect to an SNA Server that exists in a non-trusted Windows NT
server domain.

This problem occurs under either of the following conditions:

Case 1: "Use Client/Server Encryption"
--------------------------------------

The "Use Client/Server Encryption" option is selected for the configured
users/groups in SNA Server Manager.

Case 2: "Use Windows NT Domain Password"
----------------------------------------

The "Use Windows NT domain password" option is not selected in the Windows 95 SNA
Server client configuration. This option is available by selecting the Advanced
tab after running the SNA Client Configuration program.

CAUSE
=====

There is a different cause for each condition described in the "Symptoms"
section of this article.

Case 1: "Use Client/Server Encryption"
--------------------------------------

If Client/Server Encryption is being used, the client/server encryption check
fails because the client is in a non-trusted domain causing the client to hang.

Case 2: "Use Windows NT Domain Password"
----------------------------------------

The Windows 95 SNA Server client uses the LsaLogonUser() call when attempting to
log the user on, even though the "Use Windows NT domain password" option is not
selected. This was causing the logon attempt to fail and this caused the Windows
95 client to hang.

RESOLUTION
==========

Two problems were corrected to resolve the problem.

Case 1: "Use Client/Server Encryption"
--------------------------------------

The SNA Server client transports were updated, such that the SNA Server client is
disconnected if the client/server encryption check fails. The updated modules
for this fix are:

   <Snaroot>\System\Snaat.dll
   <Snaroot>\System\Snabv.dll
   <Snaroot>\System\Snalm.dll
   <Snaroot>\System\Snalm.dll
   <Snaroot>\System\Snanb.dll
   <Snaroot>\System\Snanw.dll
   <Snaroot>\System\Snadmod.dll
   <Snaroot>\System\Snaevent.dll

Case 2: "Use Windows NT Domain Password"
----------------------------------------

The Windows 95 SNA Server 3.0 client has been updated to use the NTLM logon
process instead of the LsaLogonUser() logon procedure when the "Use Windows NT
domain password" option is not selected. The updated modules for this fix are:

   <Snaroot>\System\Snabase.exe
   <Winroot>\System\Snakrnl.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
