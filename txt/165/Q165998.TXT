TITLE   :Cold Fusion Applications Bypass Security
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::2.0,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Cold Fusion template files that should be only accessible to authenticated users
are also getting returned to other users.

CAUSE
=====

The Cold Fusion ISAPI dll file is running in a manner that does not preserve the
user context. Therefore, it allows the cfm file to run solely based on the
permissions assigned the Cold Fusion dll (Iscf.dll) file.

WORKAROUND
==========

Allaire is working on a new version of the .dll file (maintenance fix 2.02) that
will resolve the problem.
