TITLE   :Client Functions Can't Use TCP/IP Sockets on SNA Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1,2.11 SP2,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When running SNA Admin, SNA Manager, or any SNA applications on an SNA Server,
the Admin/Manager program or SNA application always uses named pipes when
communicating to other SNA Servers in the subdomain. There is no way to force
SNA Admin or the SNA application to use a non-named pipe transport (such as
TCP/IP sockets or IPX/SPX).


CAUSE
=====

When initiating client functions from an SNA Server, the DMOD would always
choose the first LAN transport configured, which always defaults to Microsoft
Networking named pipes (Snalm.dll), even when named pipes is not selected during
SNA Server Setup. The named pipe transport is always used on the SNA Server,
because this transport supports file access to the shared SNA Server
configuration file, which is always performed over Microsoft Networking.

RESOLUTION
==========

Updates to SNA Server versions 2.11 (post Service Pack 2) and 3.0 are available
to correct this problem. With this update applied on an SNA Server, SNA Server
Admin (and other client functions) can now use TCP/IP sockets or other non-named
pipe transport methods to communicate with other SNA Servers in the SNA
subdomain.

Within SNA Server Setup, the administrator defines what client LAN transports the
server will support. If both named pipes and TCP/IP sockets are chosen, then the
following registry value must be added to allow SNA Admin (or any SNA
application running on the SNA Server) to use TCP/IP sockets instead of named
pipes:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaBase\Parameters

   Value Name:  TransportBase
   Data Type:  REG_DWORD

   Data: 1

NOTE: The first TransportBase is 0 which always points to Snalm.dll.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11, 2.11
Service Pack 1, 2.11 Service Pack 2, and 3.0. This problem was corrected in the
latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
