TITLE   :TN3270 Service Doesn't Read Configuration Changes
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If changes are made to a TN3270 Property page, the TN3270 Service will not read
and recognize these configuration changes; therefore, these changes will not
take effect.

CAUSE
=====

The TN3270 Service only reads the configuration changes if a change was made to
a non-TN3270 specific option.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix is available for the TN3270 Service to force it to re-read the
configuration file if a change is made to any TN3270 specific option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
