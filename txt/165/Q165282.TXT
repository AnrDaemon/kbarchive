======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Setup for a Windows-based program, you may receive the following
error message:

   This version of MSVCRT40.DLL is intended for Win32s only.

Setup then quits and the program does not run. Or, you may receive the error
message after you upgrade from Windows 3.x to Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

The Msvcrt40.dll file in the Windows\System folder is not the version required
by the program.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you receive this message when you are installing Microsoft Publisher 97, see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q165642 PUB97: Publisher Setup Quits after Msvcrt40.dll Error Message

Otherwise, you need to find and rename all occurrences of the Msvcrt40.dll file
by following these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "msvcrt40.dll" (without the quotation marks).

3. Select the Include Subfolders check box, and then click Find Now. At least
   one copy of the Msvcrt40.dll file should be found in the Windows\System
   folder. There may be other copies of the file.

4. Click the copy of the Msvcrt40.dll file in the Windows\System folder, and
   then click Rename on the File menu.

5. Type a new name (such as Msvcrt40.old).

6. Repeat steps 4-5 for each copy of the file found.

7. On the File menu, click Close.

8. Run the program's Setup program again. This should restore the correct file.

   NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0, or 4.01 you
   may now need to extract the Msvcrt40.dll file from the Ie4mfc40.cab file. For
   information about using the Extract command, please see the following article
   in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q129605 How to Extract Original Compressed Windows Files

Note that if any of the Msvcrt40.dll files are in use by Windows, it may be
necessary to restart the computer to an MS-DOS prompt to rename the file. To do
so, follow these steps:

1. Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
   F8, and then select "Safe Mode Command Prompt Only".

2. Rename all copies of the Msvcrt40.dll file to Msvcrt40.old.

3. Restart your computer normally.

NOTE: This error does not occur if you are running Microsoft Windows NT
Workstation version 4.0. If you have Windows NT 4.0, do not replace
Msvcrt40.dll.
