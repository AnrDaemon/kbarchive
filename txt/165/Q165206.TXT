-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) may be installed on Windows NT
standalone (non-domain controller) servers for access by NetWare-compatible
users.

For NetWare-compatible users to be able to gain access to domain resources, the
following rules apply:

 - If the standalone server is a domain member server, FPNW authenticates users
   from the local account database or the domain account database.

 - If the standalone server is not a domain member server (otherwise a workgroup
   member), NetWare-compatible user accounts will not be able to use the domain
   account database for authentication. Those users will not be granted access
   to the FPNW server unless their account is in the local user accounts
   database of the standalone server.
