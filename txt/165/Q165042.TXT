SYMPTOMS
========

Regdel.exe does not appear to work and will not return any error codes.

CAUSE
=====

Regdel.exe is a resource kit utility that can be used to delete keys from the
local registry or from a remote registry. Regdel.exe cannot be used to delete
values, only keys.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Regdel will only delete registry entries under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, and will
default to this registry key.

For example: to delete all the keys and their associated values underneath
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Test, type:

   regdel "software\microsoft\test"

Regdel.exe is not case sensitive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

functionality of and replaces the following tools from previous Resource Kits:
