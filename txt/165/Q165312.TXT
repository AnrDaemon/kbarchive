TITLE   :Unable To Connect to Internet Mail over RAS with WinNT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you connect your Windows NT version 4.0 Remote Access Service (RAS) client
to your Internet Service Provider (ISP), you are unable to connect to your
Internet Mail Server using your mail application. Also, you are unable to use
Telnet.exe to connect to TCP port 25 on your Internet Mail Server.

However, you are able to successfully ping your Internet Mail Server by IP
address and host name. You are also able to use mail applications to connect to
your Local Area Network (LAN) mail servers.

NOTE: This may affect Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking Clients and Windows NT 3.5x
RAS Clients as specified below.

CAUSE
=====

This issue may be caused by one or more of the following:

 - This may be caused if the router at the ISP is unable to handle the 'IP
   Header compression' feature in Windows NT 4.0. (The final ACK packet on
   Windows NT 3.51 and Windows 95 is 60 bytes large; in Windows NT 4.0 it is 54
   bytes).


   -or-

 - The Winsock Proxy client is installed on your Windows NT 4.0 RAS Client (this
   may apply to Windows NT 3.5x RAS client also). In this case, you are also
   unable to Telnet to local servers.

   -or-

 - Your Internet Mail Server does not have an IP address assigned to the
   Multi-channel Memorandum Distribution Facility (MMDF) . In this case, the
   Windows NT Server 3.5x RAS client and Windows 95 DUN will also be unable to
   Telnet to port 25 on the Internet Mail Server.
