SYMPTOMS
========

When TN3270 Service attempts to acquire a session on behalf of a TN3270 client
emulator, the following events will appear in the application event log and the
client will fail to connect:

   

   Event ID : 305
   Source: TN3270 Server
   Description: RUI_INIT specifying LU <LUA LU Name> failed with
   LUA_PARAMETER_CHECK / LUA_INVALID_LUNAME for <ip address>
   (port <port number>).

   Event ID: 1955
   Source: SNA RUI Application
   Description: RUI_INIT failed for LU <LUA LU Name>, primary_rc = 100,
   secondary_rc = 1000000

CAUSE
=====

The TN3270 Service is attempting to use an LUA LU that was added to the
configuration, but then deleted. This problem only occurs when using the command
line SNA Server configuration utility called Snacfg.exe to delete the LUA LU.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix was made to snacfg to actually delete the LUA LU from the Com.cfg when a
deletion is requested.

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. The updated file is:

   Tn3servr.exe

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
