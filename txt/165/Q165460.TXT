TITLE   :SNA Server 3.0 Install Path Must Be Eight Characters or Less
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0; winnt:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft SNA Workstation, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the installation path specified for SNA Server 3.0 contains more than eight
characters, the following error message is displayed:

   Illegal Directory Specified

   Illegal directory name - restart setup and choose the target directory name
   for SNA Server to be max 8 characters, with no spaces between.

The same error message occurs if the installation path contains a directory name
that is greater than eight characters in length.

These problems also occur with SNA Workstation 3.0 and the Windows NT SNA Server
3.0 Client.

CAUSE
=====

The setup programs for SNA Server, SNA Workstation 3.0, and the Windows NT 3.0
client do not support paths or directory names greater than eight characters in
length.

RESOLUTION
==========

The setup program has been updated to support paths and directory names that are
longer than eight characters. The following restrictions still apply even after
applying this fix:

 - The installation path must be 40 characters or less in length.

 - The installation path must not include any spaces. The following example is
   not a valid path:

   C:\Program Files\SNA


The updated files are:

   SNA Server: <Snaroot>\Setup\Server\Snasetup.dll
   Windows NT Client: <Snaroot>\Setup\Ntclient\Snasetup.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
