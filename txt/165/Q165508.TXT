TITLE   :SMS: PCM Does Not Follow Correct Distribution Server Logic
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.0,1.1,1.2,1.2 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcmkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The 32-bit versions of Package Command Manager (Pcmwin32.exe and Pcmsvc32.exe)
do not correctly follow the distribution selection logic as described below.

Package Command Manager (PCM) Distribution Server Selection Logic:

1. Check the distribution server list for the package to see if the current
   logon server exists in the list. If it does exist, then use that server as
   the distribution server.

2. Check the server names for each currently connected drive letter. If any of
   the server names for the currently connected drives match a server in the
   package distribution list, then use that server as the distribution server.

3. Check the current logon server for the package, using the explicit path to
   the package share. This is to ensure that the current logon server does
   actually contain the package, even if it is not in the list of 10 package
   servers.

4. If steps 1-3 fail, randomly select a server from the package distribution
   list, and connect to that server. If the connection fails for any reason,
   randomly pick another server from the package server list, until either a
   server is connected, or the list is exhausted.

CAUSE
=====

Up to and including Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 1, the 32-bit
implementation of Package Command Manager did not successfully find a match for
steps 1-3 indicated above.







Because steps 1 through 3 fail to return a match, the 32-bit implementation of
Package Command Manager randomly chooses a distribution server from those listed
in the PCM instruction.

STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.2 Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in
the latest Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack.
