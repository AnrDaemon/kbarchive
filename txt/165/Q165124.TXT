IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT ends daylight savings time in the Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and
Adeliade time zones on the first Sunday in March. The time zones do not actually
officially switch back to standard time until the last Sunday of March.

CAUSE
=====

The date that Windows NT ends daylight savings time is set incorrectly in the
system registry.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - The Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit includes a TZEDIT program. Use this program
   to change the affected time zones to end daylight savings time on the last
   Sunday in March.

 - If the Resource Kit is unavailable, make the following changes in the system
   registry.

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
   require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee
   that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
   solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

   1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

   2. In the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, find the subkey for the Adelaide time
      zone:

      SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zones\Cen.
      Australia Standard Time

      NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
      readability.

   3. Open the value TZI in your time zone key to get into the binary editor.

   4. You should see binary information like this:

      C6FDFFFF00000000C4FFFFFF0000030000000100020000000000000000000
      A00000005000200000000000000

      NOTE: The above binary information is one line; it has been wrapped for
      readability.

   5. Change this value to the following value:

      C6FDFFFF00000000C4FFFFFF0000030000000500020000000000000000000
      A00000005000200000000000000

      NOTE: The above binary information is one line; it has been wrapped for
      readability.

   6. In the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree find the subkey for the Brisbane,
      Melbourne, Sydney time zone:

      SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zones\Sydney
      Standard Time

      NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
      readability.

   7. Open the value TZI in your time zone key to get into the binary editor.

   8. You should see binary information like this:

      A8FDFFFF00000000C4FFFFFF0000030000000100020000000000000000000
      A00000005000200000000000000

      NOTE: The above binary information is one line; it has been wrapped for
      readability.

   9. Change this value to the following value:

      A8FDFFFF00000000C4FFFFFF0000030000000500020000000000000000000
      A00000005000200000000000000

      NOTE: The above binary information is one line; it has been wrapped for
      readability.

   10. Quit Registry editor and restart your computer.

   11. The system should now end Daylight Savings Time on the last Sunday in
      March.

 - You can also make the necessary registry changes using Regini.exe from the
   resource kit in conjunction with a text file that contains the following
   entries:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
   \Time zones\Cen. Australia Standard Time
   TZI = REG_BINARY 0x0000002c 0xfffffdc6 0x00000000 0xffffffc4 0x00030000
   0x00050000 0x00000002 0x00000000 0x000a0000 0x00050000 0x00000002
   0x00000000

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
   \Time Zones\Sydney Standard Time
   TZI = REG_BINARY 0x0000002c 0xfffffda8 0x00000000 0xffffffc4 0x00030000
   0x00050000 0x00000002 0x00000000 0x000a0000 0x00050000 0x00000002
   0x00000000

   Create this text file using Edit.com or Notepad with word wrap turned off. The
   text file can only contain ascii text characters. The key name has to be on
   one line, and the value on the next line, the value being spaced in 4 spaces.
   Save the text file using any eight-dot-three standard name you like. Then use
   regini as per the example below.

   Example:

   regini <filename>

   This will automatically make the necessary changes for you.
