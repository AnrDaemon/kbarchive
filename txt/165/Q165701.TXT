TITLE   :Exiting Manager Causes Access Violation If No Servers Running
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If Host Security Integration Service is installed, exiting SNA Server Manager
may cause an access violation if there are no computers running SNA Server. This
occurs most easily when the configuration file is opened in offline mode.

CAUSE
=====

The Host Security extension DLL (Hostsec.dll) starts a thread which waits to
find an SNA Server in the subdomain. If doesn't find one, the thread never
terminates. When exiting SNA Manager, this results in an access violation when
the host security DLL is unloaded.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server is available to correct this problem.


To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. The updated file is:

   Hostsec.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
