SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Visual Basic for Applications Borders.Count command on a
selected paragraph, the value returned is five instead of an expected value of
four.

CAUSE
=====

By design, Borders.Count returns five because paragraph borders have an inside
horizontal border which you can set and/or retrieve even though it may not
visible. If you insert another paragraph, the inside border may or may not
become visible, depending on your setting.
