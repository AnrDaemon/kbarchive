TITLE   :Add Printer Wizard Cannot Find Needed Files on CD-ROM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a printer using the Add Printer Wizard, at the end of the
installation process you are prompted for the location of the printer files.
Even though you specify the path to the Windows NT CD-ROM, you may still be
prompted for the location of the printer driver files.

CAUSE
=====

The Msprint.inf and Msprint2.inf files are located in the <Windows>\Inf
folder, where <Windows> is the folder in which Windows NT was installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename the Msprint.inf and Msprint2.inf files in the <Windows>\Inf folder
to Msprint.old and Msprint2.old. After doing so, run the Add Printer Wizard
again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Msprint.inf and Msprint2.inf files are Windows 95 printer .inf files. When
the Add Printer Wizard is run, it uses these files instead of the Ntprint.inf
file and prompts for the wrong files.
