 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to enable the use of Internet hyperlinks and file
shortcuts in a Microsoft Exchange form. This allows the recipient of a form to
view references to the Internet and file resources as hyperlinks. For example,
these can be viewed as hyperlinks or shortcuts:

   http://www.microsoft.com

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com

   file:\\myserver\myshare\myfile.doc

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable Internet hypertext links or file shortcuts in a form, you must use a
RichEntry field that has a Reference Name of MAPI_Body_Custom. Only one field
per window can be used as a MAPI_Body_Custom, so only one RichEntry field per
window can allow Internet and file hyperlinks. However, you can have multiple
RichEntry fields on a Form window.

To change the Reference Name of a RichEntry field to MAPI_Body_Custom:

1. In the Form window, select the RichEntry field you want to use and on the
   View menu, click Field Properties.

2. On the General tab, in the Reference Name box, select the MAPI_Body_Custom
   check box.

NOTE: If this name is already taken by another field on the Form window, change
one of the fields' Reference Names. Only one field per window can have the name
MAPI_Body_Custom.
