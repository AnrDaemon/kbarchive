TITLE   :Default Domain Administrator Not Correctly Configured
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you change the Administrator accounts password or any other account with
domain administrative privileges, you receive the following error message:

   This default domain administrator is not configured correctly.

However, if you click OK, you are logged in and have full administrative
privileges.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message can occur if a Citrix Winframe client is running on the
workstation where you try to log on. Within the Citrix Winframe Client setup,
there is a User-ID & Password option. If this option has been filled out
using an account whose credentials no longer match (for example, the password
has changed), the accounts will no longer be in synch, and will cause the error
message.

RESOLUTION
==========

Clear the checkbox in the Citrix Winframe Client setup (there should also be a
Citrix tab in User Manager where you can access this information) so that no
account is defined. You can also change the password to match that of the
specified account.
