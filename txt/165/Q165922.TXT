TITLE   :WD97: Converting ActiveX to Picture Causes Invalid Page Fault
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbProgramming word8 kbwordvba word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to convert an ActiveX Control Object to a Word Picture Object using
Visual Basic for Applications causes the following error message:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

The details of the error message show:

   WINWORD caused an invalid page fault in WINWORD.EXE at 0137:30440759.

Choosing OK causes Word to close.

CAUSE
=====

When creating your macro, Visual Basic for Applications does not check to see
whether the method of conversion you are applying to an object is an allowed
method for the object type.

The error message appears because an ActiveX object (controls such as a check
box, command button, and so on) cannot be converted to a Word Picture object.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
