TITLE   :Dynamic Updates for Adding LUs to Pools Is Broken
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an LU is assigned to pool, and then removed from the pool, and the file is
saved while the SNA Server service is active, the SNA Server determines that the
LU assignment to the pool took effect.

CAUSE
=====

This is a problem related to dynamic updates. After a dynamic update occurs
because the LU was added to the pool, SNA Server receives a notification and
assumes that a new LU had been created. Therefore, two records exist for the LU
and subsequent status updates go to the wrong LU.

RESOLUTION
==========

A change was made so that SNA Server checks whether the LU already exists when a
dynamic update occurs, and if so ignores the message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
