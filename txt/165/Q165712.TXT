TITLE   :XFOR: Err Msg: The Microsoft Exchange Server is Down
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to an Exchange Server version 5.0 mailbox from an
Internet browser, you may get the error message:

   Sorry! The Microsoft Exchange Server is down or the HTTP Service has been
   disabled by an administrator. Please try your request again later.

This error message may occur even though the Exchange Server has been properly
configured to receive browser requests for mail delivery and the HTTP Service
has not been disabled.

CAUSE
=====

This problem has been seen to occur when Allow Anonymous Access is enabled on
the Service tab of the Properties Dialog Box for the WWW Service in the
Microsoft Internet Service Manager for Microsoft Internet Information Server
(IIS). This problem has also been reported to occur if the LDAP protocol has
been disabled for the Exchange Server that you are attempting to connect to.

WORKAROUND
==========

It is sometimes possible to workaround this problem by following these steps:

1. Install an Exchange Client and create a profile on the computer that is
   running IIS and the Microsoft Exchange Server Active Server components.

2. Deselect the Allow Anonymous Access option for the WWW Service in IIS.

3. Stop the IIS services and then the Exchange Services.

4. Start the Exchange Services and then the IIS services. You can also restart
   the entire computer instead of performing steps 2 and 3.

5. Log into the Exchange Server via the web as an authenticated user.

6. At this point you can enable Allow Anonymous Access again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
