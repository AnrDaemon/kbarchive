TITLE   :NetScape Navigator Hangs Connecting to Secure IIS Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:Winnt:2.0,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use IIS 2.0 or 3.0, and you secure the site with a 128-bit key from
Verisign (or some other legitimate provider), Netscape Navigator version 3.0
appears to hang.

CAUSE
=====

If the computer hosting the IIS server was originally set with 128-bit security,
and then a Service Pack was applied that overwrote the 128-bit Schannel.dll file
then Navigator will not connect if it is set to use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 3
security.

WORKAROUND
==========

By default, Navigator installs with SSL 3 security enabled. To connect to the
site, either disable SSL 3 security or replace the newer 40-bit Schannel.dll
file on the server with the proper 128-bit file.
