TITLE   :BUG: Incorrect WHERE Clause Shows in View Designer
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbvfp kbvfp500bug kbvfp600bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SQL window in the View Designer shows an incorrect WHERE clause if the view
is browsed in the database before it is modified. The field names are prefaced
with the name of the view instead of the name of the table the view is based on.

RESOLUTION
==========

When creating the view, preface the field names in the WHERE clause with the
table name.

-or-

If the Browse window has already been opened, close it and close the view, then
modify the view and the SQL WHERE clause will be correct.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code to create a new database with a table and a view of
   that table.

         SET DEFAULT TO HOME()+"\samples\data"
         USE customer
         COPY TO new_cust
         CREATE DATABASE new_dbc
         ADD TABLE new_cust
         CREATE SQL VIEW test AS SELECT country, maxordamt ;
               FROM new_cust WHERE country="USA" and maxordamt>10000
         MODIFY DATABASE NOWAIT

2. Right-click on the View and select Browse.

3. Right-click on the View and select Modify.

4. In the View Designer, click SQL on the View Designer toolbar.

   Look at the WHERE clause. The field names are prefaced with the view name not
   the table name. The WHERE clause looks correct if the view is modified
   without browsing first.
