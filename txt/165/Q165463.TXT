TITLE   :WINS Admin Shows Huge Version ID for WINS Records
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the WINS database with the WINS Administration utility, you may
see a large number for the owner Highest ID as well as several records owned by
that WINS Server with a large version ID.

This does not cause any problem as far as replication and other WINS- related
operations are concerned.


CAUSE
=====

This problem is related to Jet Database. WINS depends on the JET database to
provide the version ID. If JET returns a large version ID for a record, WINS
will use this to replicate to its Push or Pull partners.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use Winscl.exe (part of the Windows NT Resource Kit) to
remove the record with large version ID from the owner of the WINS database, as
well as from the replication partners showing the large version number.
