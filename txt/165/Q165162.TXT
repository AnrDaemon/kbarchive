TITLE   :WD97: AutoNum Fields Don't Update When Deleted W/ Track Changes
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbproof kbfield

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you delete a numbered paragraph from a numbered list, Word does not update
the remaining list numbers correctly. This problem occurs when both of the
following are true:

 - The numbered list was created using an automatic numbering field, such as
   AutoNum, AutoNumOut, or AutoNumLgl.

   -and-

 - The "Track changes while editing" option is selected in the Highlight Changes
   dialog box (point to Track Changes and then click Highlight Changes on the
   Tools menu).

CAUSE
=====

Word cannot reflect changes to a numbered list when the numbering is the result
of a field. A field displays a result which Word treats as normal text. If you
are using the "Track changes while editing" option with the automatic numbering
fields, Word strikes through the deleted text and the field.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, accept the revisions in your document and Word will
update the remaining fields automatically:

1. On the Tools menu, point to Track Changes, and then click "Accept or Reject
   Changes."

2. In the "Accept or Reject Changes" dialog box, click Accept All to accept all
   revisions in the document or click Find and accept or reject each revision
   individually.
