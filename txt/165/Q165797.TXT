TITLE   :SMS: Remote Control Disables Windows NT Screen Saver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2,3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After the remote control of a client computer running Windows NT 3.5x, the
screen saver wait time is disabled. This means that the screen saver will not
start automatically until either the client is restarted, or the workaround
below is followed.

Client computers running Windows NT 4.0 are unaffected.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

1. Stop the Systems Management Server Remote Control Agent service running on
   the client.

2. In the Desktop Control Panel, enter the screen saver setup and simply click
   OK.

3. Start the Systems Management Server Remote Control Agent service running on
   the client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
