SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft SQL Server has a service called SQL Mail. When SQL Mail service is
started, it requires the ability to log on to a MAPI compliant e-mail client.

The SQL Mail service was designed to send mail directly from SQL Server. It
commonly is used for error reporting and other SQL Server administrative e-
mail.

This article describes steps to set up the Microsoft Exchange Client on the
Windows NT Server so the SQL Mail service can start successfully.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up the Microsoft Exchange Client on the Windows NT Server so the SQL Mail
service can start successfully:

1. Create an Exchange Server Profile for the Microsoft SQL Service Account:

   a. Log on to the computer running Windows NT Server (where Microsoft SQL
      Server is running) as the SQL service account.

   b. Create a profile by double-clicking the Inbox on the desktop (in Windows
      NT 4.0) or by running Microsoft Exchange from the Program Manager (Windows
      NT 3.5x). If there is no profile set up yet, Microsoft Exchange will step
      you through the creation of a profile. You do not need to set up a
      Personal Folder (.pst file); all mail can reside on the computer running
      Exchange Server.

NOTE: The SQL Service account must have permissions to open the mailbox that was
referenced in the profile you created.

1. Verify that you can run Microsoft Exchange Client without having to select a
   profile name upon startup. If Microsoft Exchange requires you to select a
   profile, select one so you can enter the Client. then select On the Tools
   menu, click-Options and change the Startup Options so one profile is always
   used.

2. Log off Windows NT Server and log back on as yourself or Administrator.

3. Start the SQL Mail service; it should start successfully now.
