TITLE   :WD97: Custom Bullet or Number Lost After Save to RTF
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbusage word97 kbnumbering

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a custom style based on any of the built-in List Bullet or List
Number styles and then modify the custom style with a new bullet or number
format, the custom style will lose the new bullet or number format and revert
back to the default bullet or number definition when you save the document as
Rich Text Format (RTF).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.

Method 1: Base the Custom Style on "(no style)"
-----------------------------------------------

When you create a custom style, do not base it on a built-in style. Instead, base
the new style on "(no style)" and then define the attributes of the style.

Method 2: Change the Built-in List Bullet or List Number Style
--------------------------------------------------------------

Rather than changing the bullet or number properties of the custom style, change
the bullet or number properties of the built-in style that the custom style is
based on. The changes will be applied to the custom style as well.
