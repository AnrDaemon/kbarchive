TITLE   :Link Service Not Configured with Short Length of Service Title
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When configuring link services on SNA Server Manager, if the link service title
string is less than 11 characters, you will receive the following messages:

   Link Service Error - This link service cannot be configured using SNA Server
   manager. To configure this link service, run the External Link Service tool
   from tools menu.

CAUSE
=====

The DWORD variable containing the size of a buffer used to store a registry
value wasn't being set, and therefore the value containing the link service DLL
name could not be determined.

RESOLUTION
==========

This fix sets the buffer to the size it was before calling RegQueryValueEx.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can change the link service title to a length greater than 11 character in
the registry.

The value in the registry is:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
      \SnaSdlcx\Parameters\Title

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
