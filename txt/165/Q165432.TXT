TITLE   :PRB: DBGrid Does Not Insert Record If Field Name Contains Dash

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to add a row to an SQL Server table using DBGrid bound to a Remote
Data Control, you receive the following error message if one of the table's
field names contains a "-":

   ODBC error: 37000 [Microsoft][SQL Server Driver]Line2: Incorrect syntax
   near '-'

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Remote Data Objects code is creating a SQL
INSERT statement that doesn't put quotation marks around field names. The INSERT
statement would resemble the following:

      INSERT INTO x (id, e-mail)
      VALUES (1, 'Eric')

If RDO generated an INSERT statement that used double quotes around the field
name, then the INSERT would work. The following syntax would work:

      INSERT INTO x (id, "e-mail")
      VALUES (1, 'Eric')

RESOLUTION
==========

Either rename the field so that it doesn't contain a hyphen or do the updates
manually (where the developer creates the proper SQL syntax).

STATUS
======

This is by design. SQL Server does not support the use of dashes in its
identifiers, including server names, database names, tables, views, columns,
indexes, triggers, procedures, defaults, and rules.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In an SQL Server database, create a table with a field that has a dash in it.
   For example, use the following script with MSQuery:

         CREATE TABLE x
         (id INTEGER,
         "e-mail" VARCHAR(10))
         // Note the double quotes to avoid the error with the dash.

2. Create a Data Source that points to the correct database.

3. Make an MFC Dialog application.

4. Add the Microsoft Remote Data Control (MSRDC) to the dialog box that is being
   created. Set the following properties of the MSRDC control:

   DataSourceName    to your data source
   CursorDriver      1-ODBC cursor
   LockType          3-Optimistic concurrency
   ResultType        1-Create a Keyset cursor
   SQL               SELECT * FROM x

5. Add a DBGrid to the dialog box and set the following properties:

   AllowAddNew       True
   AllowUpdates      True
   DataSource        the name of the MSRDC

6. Build and run the application. While running the application, try to insert a
   record in the grid, that is (1, Eric). Move off the record and the error
   message occurs.
