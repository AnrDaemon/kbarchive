SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running Active Server Pages version 1.0b on Microsoft Internet
Information Server (IIS) version 3.0, and you are storing objects in the
Application scope, you may experience performance problems and increased memory
usage by IIS.

CAUSE
=====

These performance problems are caused by a memory leak in the Asp.dll file when

Performance Monitor.

==========

A hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location. You can download
the self-extracting files from the following service:
