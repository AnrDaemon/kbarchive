TITLE   :Virus Scanning for Outgoing Files Can Cause Setups to Run Slow
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Users may experience a noticeable performance degradation when they run
applications that download many files from a Windows NT server computer. This
behavior has been observed specifically when running SETUP for applications that
are stored on server hard drive volumes (i.e. an administrative setup of
Office). The performance drag is not noticed when setup is running from a shared
CD-ROM drive.

CAUSE
=====

Certain virus scanning services that scan for outgoing files from the server can
affect the executable's performance.

RESOLUTION
==========

To determine if the virus scanning service is the cause, disable outgoing
scanning and re-run the executable.


Additional query words: drag
