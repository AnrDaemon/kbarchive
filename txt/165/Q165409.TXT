SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to find information about non-breaking spaces in
Microsoft Word Help.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A non-breaking space is used to prevent a line break between two words you want
to keep together. For example, if you want to keep a date, such as May 20, 1997
from breaking incorrectly when you reach the end of a line of text, add a
non-breaking space between the month and day and between the day and year. To
insert a non-breaking space at the insertion point, press CTRL+SHIFT+SPACEBAR.

For information about shortcut keys, click the Office Assistant, type "shortcut
keys," click Search, and then click to view "Shortcut keys." In the Shortcut
keys topic, click to view "Use keys to edit and move text and graphics."

For information about non-breaking spaces, click the Office Assistant, type "What
is a non-breaking space," click Search, click to view "Find and Replace", click
"Find and replace paragraph marks, page breaks, and other items", and then click
"How". Information about non-breaking spaces can be found on the page titled
"Examples of special characters and document elements you can find and
replace."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Word Help is not installed on your computer,
