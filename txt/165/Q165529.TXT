The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a new style based on an existing style and then define the
existing (based on) style to include numbering, the new style will also be
defined to include numbering.

NOTE: Numbering includes Bulleted, Numbered, and Outline Numbered.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design and is different from earlier versions of Word. Any
custom style inherits numbering that is applied to the style it is based on.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not apply numbering to the existing style. Instead, apply numbering to the
new style.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In earlier versions of Word, if you create a new style, for example MyStyle, and
base it on the built-in Heading 1 style, it takes on the Heading 1 style
attributes. If you then define Heading 1 to have heading numbering, Heading 1
will have the heading numbering attribute applied to it, but MyStyle will not.

In Word 97 for Windows, when you define the Heading 1 style to have heading
numbering, both Heading 1 and MyStyle have the heading number attribute applied
to them.
