SUMMARY
=======

When you try to import a CSV through the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator
program, it may be necessary to include a carriage return within a field.

A carriage return can be signified within a field by using '\r\n'. For example,
to specify the address

   1 Microsoft Way
   Redmond, WA 98052

in a CSV you type:

   " 1 Microsoft Way\r\nRedmond, WA 98052 " (without the quotation marks)
