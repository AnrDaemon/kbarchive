The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run Windows on a Novell NetWare network, check the SET TEMP= variable
for the following:

 - You must have both read and write privileges (rights) to the directory where
   the SET TEMP= variable is pointed.

 - The above directory must exist and normally be empty when Windows is not
   running.

 - You cannot share a TEMP directory with other users.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you do a network installation of Windows (SETUP /N) to your local hard
drive, or your user directory on the network, you can either set your TEMP
directory to the local hard drive or subdirectory on the network.

Local Hard Drive
----------------

If you install your user files on your local hard driver, then the SET TEMP=
should also be set to your local hard drive. You already have full privileges to
it.

User Directory on Server
------------------------

If you have your personal Windows files in your user directory on the server,
then the SET TEMP= can be pointed to a directory on your local hard drive if you
have one, or a TEMP subdirectory under your user directory. If you use the user
directory, make sure you have read and write privileges to that directory and
the TEMP subdirectory.

You should use the Novell MAP ROOT command in mapping to the user directory on
the server. For more information on this procedure, refer to the NETWORKS.WRI
file shipped with Windows.

For example, assuming "Robert's" user directory has been map rooted as M:, and
the TEMP directory is under Robert's user directory, then SET TEMP=M:\TEMP is
the proper syntax in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If SET
TEMP=F:\USERS\BOB\WINDOWS\TEMP is used, Windows may complain about insufficient
disk space or memory.

With Windows, it is usually best to have only one drive mapping for any given
directory -- whether it is a mapped drive or a search drive -- and have only one
path to access it.
