SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses why Novell NetWare 286 servers may stop responding (hang)
when Windows is run on multiple workstations connected to the server.

NetWare 286 servers have a 16K dynamic memory pool that's shared by all
workstations that are connected to the server. Each workstation logged on to the
server uses 200 bytes of this 16K. In addition, each MS-DOS-based application
started from a workstation running Windows uses 200 bytes of the 16K if the
workstation is logged onto the server. When the 16K is depleted, the server
stops responding (hangs).

This problem does not occur with NetWare 386 servers; the use of the 16K dynamic
memory pool is a limitation in NetWare 286.

WORKAROUND
==========

To workaround this limitation, add the following line to the [NETWARE] section
of the SYSTEM.INI file.

   NWShareHandles=Yes

MORE INFORMATION
================

NetWare 286 servers store 200-byte entries for each user that is logged on.
These entries are kept in Dynamic Memory Pool #1 (DMP1). You can view the
Dynamic Memory Pools by running the FCONSOLE command, choosing STATISTICS, and
then SUMMARY. The DMP1 is limited to about 16K in size. The server stops
responding (hangs) if this space is used up. NetWare 386 does not share this
limitation because it can dynamically allocate more memory to the pool.

Normally, it take about 83 users to exhaust this memory pool. However, Windows is
capable of running multiple MS-DOS-based applications, on one computer. Each
MS-DOS-based application is considered a separate logon for the purposes of
memory pool allocation, an uses another 200 bytes from the 16K memory pool.
Therefore, it is possible to hang the server with only 17 workstations running 5
MS-DOS-based applications each.
