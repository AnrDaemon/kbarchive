SUMMARY
=======

Versions 3.5, 3.51, 3.52, and 3.53 of the PostScript driver that ships with
Windows 3.1 do not print shaded areas at the same resolution as the PostScript
driver that ships with Windows 3.0. The Windows 3.0 PostScript driver prints
shaded areas at 75 dots per inch (dpi) while the Windows 3.1 PostScript printer
driver prints shaded areas at 300 dpi.

This functionality was changed in the Windows 3.1 implementation of the
PostScript driver to provide consistency between all printer drivers. For
example, the PostScript printer driver for Windows 3.1 behaves the same way as
the Windows 3.1 printer drivers for the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet series of
printers.
