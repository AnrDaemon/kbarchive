TITLE   :PC OS2: Running CONVERT.EXE Under OS/2 1.3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: OS/2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

CONVERT.EXE, which is included with version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for
Presentation Manager, converts version 2.1 folders to the version 3.0 Mail
message file (MMF) format.

If you run CONVERT.EXE from an OS/2 prompt or by selecting it from a file list in
the File Manager while Mail is running, the program causes a protection
violation and terminates.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a design limitation of the Windows Libraries for OS/2
(WLO) dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). The shared DLL technology identifies tasks
using the stack segment register. Under Microsoft Windows, this stack value is
unique across all applications. With WLO applications, this is not guaranteed
because the stack value is relative to each application. CONVERT.EXE has the
same stack segment value as the Mail Spooler (MAILSPL.EXE), and this causes the
protection violation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Shut down Mail before you run the conversion utility.
