SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word, if part or all of your document is formatted with no language
reference, when you run either the spelling checker or the grammar checker, you
receive either of the following messages.

   The spelling and grammar check is complete. Text set to (no proofing) was
   skipped. To find (no proofing) text, click Edit/Replace, click More, click
   Format, click Language, and select (no proofing).

Note that the document will not be hyphenated automatically if text is formatted
with (no proofing).

CAUSE
=====

To use the spelling checker, you must specify a language. Word uses the default
language unless you specifically format part or all of your document with no
proofing. Word skips any text formatted in this way, because it does not have a
language to check against.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Select any paragraphs in your documents formatted as [no proofing], or click
   Select All on the Edit menu to select your entire document.

2. Point to Language on the Tools menu, and click Set Language. Select English
   (United States).

3. Run the spelling checker again.

The misspelled words will be correctly flagged.
