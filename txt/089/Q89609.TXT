The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you try to run Windows in standard or 386 enhanced mode on a computer using
the AMI BIOS with the following

 - Fast A20 Display

 - Fast Gate A20

CMOS options selected you may receive general protect (GP) faults or the error
message:

   Application Execution Error
   Insufficient memory to run this application,
   quit one or more Windows Application and try again.

To correct this problem, disable Fast A20 Display and Fast Gate A20. For
information about how to do this, please contact your computer manufacturer or
AMI technical support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The AMI BIOS CMOS options allow A20 gate switching to be handled by the chip set
on the motherboard rather than the keyboard controller (which might be slower).

According to AMI technical support, HIMEM.SYS should work correctly with Fast A20
Display or Fast Gate A20 enabled, but AMI has confirmed that some machines AMI
shipped had chip sets that conflict with HIMEM.SYS.

The AMI BIOS included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance
or reliability.
