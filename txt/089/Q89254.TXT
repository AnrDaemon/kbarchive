SYMPTOMS
========

If you clear the Use Substitution Table check box and select the Clear Memory
Per Page check box in the Control Panel Printers dialog box, some TrueType fonts
may print as the default font (Courier). Any TrueType font that is not preceded
by a PostScript font on the second or later pages printsas Courier. If you use
multiple fonts per page, the problem occurs only with the first TrueType font
not preceded by a PostScript font on the second or later pages.

This information applies to the Windows 3.1 PostScript driver versions 3.5, 3.51,
3.52 and 3.53.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, either select the Use Substitution Table check box or
clear the Clear Memory Per Page check box in the PostScript Advanced Options
dialog box, as follows:

1. Run Control Panel and choose the Printers icon.

2. Choose the Setup button, then the Options button.

3. Choose the Advanced button.

4. Either select the Use Substitution Table check box or clear the Clear Memory
   Per Page check box.

5. Choose the next three OK buttons to save your changes.
