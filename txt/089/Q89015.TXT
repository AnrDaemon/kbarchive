Phoenix ROM Versions for Windows
--------------------------------

According to Phoenix Technologies, if you have a ROM BIOS version dated 1988 or
earlier, you should upgrade to a later version to eliminate any possible
conflicts or unexplained behavior with Windows 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.1.


Latest Versions of the Phoenix ROM BIOS
---------------------------------------

The latest version of the Phoenix ROM BIOS for PC/AT clones (80286) is version
3.1. The latest version of the Phoenix BIOS Plus for 80386 machines is version
1.10-xx (where xx is any original equipment manufacturer's [OEM] revision
number).

How to Find Phoenix ROM BIOS Versions
-------------------------------------

To check the true BIOS date on a machine equipped with Phoenix ROM BIOS, do the
following:

1. Type the following command at the command prompt and press ENTER:

   debug

2. Type the following and press ENTER:

   d F000:FFDC

In most cases, the Debug command displays the following three lines for the
Phoenix Technologies ROM BIOS (the example below assumes a date of 08/29/89):

      F000:FFD0 <2-byte HEX numbers> 0088
      F000:FFE0 <2-byte HEX numbers> //2299//8899
      F000:FFF0 <2-byte HEX number> ...<date>

The double-date format is the actual true date for the system ROM BIOS. Bits two
and three on line 1 and line 2 are taken from each four-bit number. In the above
example, the date would be 08/29/89. The date on the third line is the original
release or revision date.

To exit the Debug program, at the dash (-) type "q" (without the quotation marks)
and press ENTER. This returns you to an MS-DOS command prompt.
