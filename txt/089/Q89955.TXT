======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Choosing the End Task button in Windows Task Manager (accessed by pressing
CTRL+ESC) does not close Sound Finder. The End Task button restores Sound Finder
rather than closing it. Once Sound Finder appears, you can close it by
double-clicking the Control menu (-) or pressing ALT+F4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sound Finder does not close from Task Manager because it depends on several
child dialog boxes to make changes to labels, descriptions, and pictures. As a
result, Sound Finder presents you with a final opportunity to review and, if
necessary, verify or change these settings.

Additional query words: 1.00 1.00a 2.00
