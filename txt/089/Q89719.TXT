KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message appears if a Windows for Workgroups server is
attempting to share virtual drives created using the MS-DOS SUBST command:

   The specified drive letter or device is invalid. If you specified a drive, it
   may be past the value specified by the LASTDRIVE command in the CONFIG.SYS
   file.

CAUSE
=====

Sharing virtual drives is not supported under Windows for Workgroups.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only way to properly share a directory with Windows for Workgroups is to
share the actual directory as specified in the Windows for Workgroups
documentation.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The SUBST command allows you to specify a drive letter for a PATH, which enables
easier access to programs and data files. In Windows for Workgroups, these
virtual drives cannot be shared.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Add the following commands to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

         SUBST X: C:\DOS
         SUBST Y: C:\WINDOWS
         SUBST Z: C:\ 

   (The above directories are an example; you can use any directory.)

2. Add the following command to the CONFIG.SYS file:

         LASTDRIVE=Z

3. Restart the computer, then start Windows for Workgroups.

4. From the Main Group, start File Manager. You should see drive icons for drive
   X, Y, and Z.

5. Choose the drive X icon.

6. From the File menu, choose Share As.

7. Choose the OK button.

8. The following error message appears:

   The specified drive letter or device is invalid. If you specified a drive, it
   may be past the value specified by the LASTDRIVE command in the CONFIG.SYS
   file.

Steps to Properly Share a Directory
-----------------------------------

To share the C:\WINDOWS directory properly, do the following:

1. Choose the drive C icon.

2. From the directory tree, select the C:\WINDOW directory.

3. From the File menu, choose Share As.

4. Choose the OK button.
