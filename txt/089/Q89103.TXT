SUMMARY
=======

If at the MS-DOS command prompt, you set up a RAM drive and connect to a network
share using the same drive letter, and then start Windows, the MS- DOS Executive
(Windows versions 3.0a and earlier) or File Manager (Windows 3.1) do not see the
RAM drive, but do see the network drive.

This is by design.

For example, if your last hard disk drive is drive E, your RAM drive will be set
up as drive F. If you then try to put a network connection on drive F, your
Drive F icon in Windows will be your network drive, not your RAM drive.
