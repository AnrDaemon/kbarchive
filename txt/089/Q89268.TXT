SUMMARY
=======

The following information applies to the BROWSE command in FoxBASE+:

 - The BROWSE command locks the entire database, which allows the user to edit
   any field.

 - In the BROWSE FREEZE command, the user can edit only one field.

 - Because the BROWSE NOMODIFY command does not lock the database, the user
   cannot edit any fields.
