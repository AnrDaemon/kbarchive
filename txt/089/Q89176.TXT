The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01 
 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

FoxBASE+ for the Macintosh (FoxBASE+/Mac) can seamlessly access files from a
Novell version 2.15c network. FoxBASE+/Mac and FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS use the same
code and access the same type databases.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use a Novell network, install the Novell Macintosh VAP software. Shared
indexes must be PC-type indexes, not Macintosh-type indexes. To make the data
available to all workstations on the network, place the databases and indexes on
the server. Use the FoxBASE+ version appropriate to each workstation. In this
configuration, record locking and file locking are supported as expected.

NOTE: Each workstation must have a copy of the FoxUSER file. Do not place the
FoxUSER file on the server. If a CONFIG.FX file is required, it must be
available on each workstation.

Additional query words: 2.01
