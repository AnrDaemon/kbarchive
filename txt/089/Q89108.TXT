-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses running Grapevine LAN with Microsoft Windows. The
following topics are included in this article:

 - SYSTEM.INI settings

 - Disable SMARTDrive version 4.0's write cache

 - Beeping network software

MORE INFORMATION
================

SYSTEM.INI Settings
-------------------

The Grapevine LAN versions 3.1b and 4.1 may stop or hang when running Windows in
386 enhanced mode if the following two entries are not in the SYSTEM.INI's
[386enh] section

      EMMEXCLUDE=xxxx-xxxx

where xxxx-xxxx is the UMA range the network card is using. If you are using a
UMA/UMB provider such as EMM386.EXE, then exclude this range in its command
line.

      ALLVMSEXCLUSIVE=YES

When this is added to the SYSTEM.INI, it precludes running MS-DOS-based
applications in the background or in a window.

Disable SMARTDrive Version 4.0's Write Cache
--------------------------------------------

When running Grapevine LAN version 1.x, then disable SMARTDrive's Write cache by
supplying drive letters at the end of the command line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file:

      C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.SYS C D

This disables Write cache on hard drive C and D. As a workaround, you could also
use the SMARTDrive that came with Windows 3.0 or MS-DOS 5.0

Beeping Network Software
------------------------

When running version 1.4g of Grapevine LAN, you may hear tones when accessing
some options inside of Windows, such as the Virtual Memory button.

Grapevine LAN sends a series of descending tones as a warning that a drive
specified in the Make Directories Available To Network section of the Define
Drives menu is offline. This warning is not received when running in the menu
mode. For more information, contact Grapevine technical support.
