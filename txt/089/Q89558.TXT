TITLE   :WFWG and Novell: LASTDRIVE=Z Makes [ and ] Active Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following symbols appear as NetWare login drives when Novell NetWare
Connectivity is loaded in Windows for Workgroups and the line LASTDRIVE=Z is
included in the CONFIG.SYS file:

     "[" and "]"

CAUSE
=====

Setting LASTDRIVE=Z conflicts with Novell NetWare NETX.COM and NETX.EXE because
they use drive letters after those set by the LASTDRIVE= statement in the
CONFIG.SYS file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, change the line to LASTDRIVE=P, instead of Z.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The value of the LASTDRIVE statement is set to P by default when Novell NetWare
connectivity is loaded in Windows for Workgroups. The LASTDRIVE statement
specifies the range of drive letters you can use for connecting to other Windows
for Workgroups computers. For example, if your LASTDRIVE is set to P, you can
use letters from A to P to connect to other Windows for Workgroups computers.

If you set up Novell NetWare connectivity, the letter that follows the LASTDRIVE
value is your login drive. (This is because Novell uses LASTDRIVE +1.) For
example:

 - If LASTDRIVE=P, then your login drive is Q. Although you can use any letter
   to connect to NetWare directories, letters after the value of the LASTDRIVE
   statement (that is drives after P) are reserved for NetWare directories only.

 - If LASTDRIVE=F, then your login drive is G, and drives after F are
   unavailable for connecting to other Windows for Workgroups computers.

NOTE: If your login script(s) has been set up to use drive F as the login drive,
setting LASTDRIVE=P may result in errors during bootup. To resolve those errors,
change your login script(s) to reflect the login drive change, or change
LASTDRIVE to E. Please note the following limitations:

 - If you set LASTDRIVE to E and your users have machines with single hard disk
   drives (C), you are limiting them to two network connections (D and E).

 - If you set LASTDRIVE to E, and your users have local hard disk drives with
   only two partitions (C and D) and a CD-ROM drive (E), they cannot establish
   any network connections.
