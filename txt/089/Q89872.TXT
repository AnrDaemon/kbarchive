SUMMARY
=======

When you use Windows Sound System Proof Reader with Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows, any
changes you make to the International option in Control Panel have no effect
when you proofread a spreadsheet.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the International option in Control Panel to specify international
settings for country, language, keyboard layout, and system of measurement. When
you select a country, Windows adjusts the date, time, currency, and number
formats to reflect those used by the selected country (these settings are saved
in the WIN.INI file). Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows does not review these changes
before starting, and therefore is not aware of them.

1-2-3 provides a way of handling internationalization (dates and times only) by
using the Format command on the Range menu. Set the format for a cell to be the
type found in this menu selection, then it should proofread accordingly.
