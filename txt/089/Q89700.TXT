Windows running in 386 enhanced mode does not allow a swap file to be
set up on a RAM drive.

Windows uses its swap file to provide demand-paged virtual memory in
386 enhanced mode. Virtual memory allows you to use more memory than
is physically installed in your machine. Virtual memory is used when
you run out of physical memory.

A RAM drive occupies physical memory, which would take physical memory
away from Windows running in 386 enhanced mode. Thus, swapping to a
RAM drive is, effectively, taking away physical memory to provide a
place to create virtual memory.
