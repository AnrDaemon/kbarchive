-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows for Workgroups on a computer using Digital Research's
DR DOS version 6.0, PROTMAN.DOS may hang the computer after displaying the
message:

   Microsoft Protocol Manager version 2.1

NOTE: PROTMAN.DOS is the protocol manager for Windows for Workgroups. It is
loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file before the media access control (MAC) driver(s) or
any additional protocol(s).

The above message should normally appear briefly, then the startup process should
continue.

STATUS
======

There is no known workaround at this time. For further information, contact
Digital Research.

Microsoft can only ensure the stability of Microsoft Windows running on MS-DOS or
PC-DOS versions 3.1 or later. Digital Research has released a software update
for running Windows with DR DOS. Microsoft neither endorses nor ensures the
stability of Microsoft Windows 3.1 running on DR DOS with or without the Digital
Research software update.

The DR DOS product included here is manufactured by Novell, a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
