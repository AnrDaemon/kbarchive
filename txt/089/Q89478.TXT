SUMMARY
=======

If you upgrade from Microsoft Windows versions 3.1 or 3.11 to Windows for
Workgroups version 3.1, some printer device settings may not be retained.

As a general rule, Microsoft recommends that customers reset their printer device
mode settings with the Control Panel. To do this, choose the Printers icon and
then choose the Setup button.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the upgrade, settings for dot matrix printer drivers are reset to the
defaults.

For PostScript and Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet printers, most settings are
retained with the exception of the previous printer memory settings, which
return to the default value. To reset these values:

1. Run Control Panel.

2. Choose the Printers icon.

3. Choose the Configure button.

4. Choose the Setup button.
