TITLE   :Use New Disk Manager Drivers After MS-DOS Uninstall
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.x,6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you uninstall MS-DOS 5.0 or later on a machine that has been partitioned with
Ontrack Disk Manager, you should continue to use the Disk Manager drivers
supplied with the version of MS-DOS that you were using when you partitioned the
disk. If you don't use these drivers, disk corruption can occur under certain
circumstances.

NOTE: This does not apply if the Disk Manager drivers are dated after the MS-DOS
5.0 files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you upgrade to MS-DOS 5.0 or later and have a partition that is larger than
32 MB, Disk Manager updates the sector information so that it appears acceptable
to MS-DOS. However, if you then uninstall MS-DOS to use an MS-DOS version prior
to version 5.0 and you use the earlier Disk Manager drivers, the drivers are not
MS-DOS version-aware, so they cannot reset the sector information automatically.
This could cause disk or file corruption. The Disk Manager drivers supplied with
MS-DOS versions 5.0 and later are MS- DOS version-aware.

To avoid these kinds of disk problems, continue using the most current Disk
Manager drivers.

The product included here, Disk Manager, is manufactured by vendors independent
