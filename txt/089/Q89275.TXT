======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your WIN.INI file's [network] section contains the line

   DefaultDialogs=1

then the updated LANMAN21.DRV's new File Manager dialog box will not be
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The WIN.INI file's DefaultDialogs=1 switch was added to work around some of the
problems that the original LANMAN21.DRV had, such as the lack of a Previous
button for connecting to former connections without having to type the full
connection path again. The new LANMAN21.DRV corrects this and several other
problems.

Additional query words: appnote 3.10 win31 LANMAN
