-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you install MS-DOS any Zenith 8086- or 8088-based computer, the 3.5- inch
disk drive formats as a 360K drive only.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Neither the DRIVPARM command nor the DRIVER.SYS device driver work on Zenith
8086- and 8088-based computers. If the following DRIVPARM or DRIVER.SYS
statements are added to the CONFIG.SYS file:

   device=[drive:]\[path]\DRIVER.SYS /d:[disk drive number] /f:7

-or-

   drivparm=/d:[disk drive number] /f:7

the following error message is displayed:

   Invalid parameter. This mode not supported, formatting 360K.

If you place a 720K 3.5-inch disk in the drive and attempt to read from the
drive, the following error is displayed:

   Invalid media, non-DOS diskette.

According to Zenith technical support, there is no way to force MS-DOS 5.0, 6.0,
or 6.2 (either retail or OEM versions) to recognize the drive as a 720K disk
drive.

The products included here are manufactured by Zenith, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
