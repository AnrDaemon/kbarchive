IBM makes an attachment for the PS/2 Model 80 called the 3363 Optical
Disk Drive. This device is designed to intercept all INT 21 function
calls and reroute them to its software program, IBM3363.EXE, for
processing. Because this device uses INT 21, Microsoft Windows cannot
recognize it. Windows works with nonremovable drives that use INT 13H
only.

NOTE: Windows version 3.1 has not been tested with this device.
