SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows may not install or run on a Hewlett-Packard (HP) Vectra with
Phoenix ROM BIOS version A.01.02.

WORKAROUND
==========

HP has a patch file that allows Windows to run properly on a Vectra with this
BIOS. The patch is called either FIRMWARE.EXE or WD.EXE, and is loaded in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If you see a file called PATCH.EXE, then the computer has an
earlier BIOS patch and not the correct one for running Windows.

If you have this BIOS on your HP Vectra, contact your HP dealer or call (800)
858-8867 in the United States or (800) 387-3867 in Canada, and ask for a later
version of the BIOS.

FIRMWARE.EXE and WD.EXE are located on the "Customer Utilities for Vectra" disk.
