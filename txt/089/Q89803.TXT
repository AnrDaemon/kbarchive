TITLE   :Windows Err Msg: FILENAME.BMP Cannot Find This File

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to open a Paintbrush file on a network server using the universal
naming convention (UNC) by File Association, you receive the following error
message:

   FILENAME.BMP
   Cannot find this file.

   Make sure that the correct path and file name are given.

CAUSE
=====

Paintbrush cannot open a file from the command line or from a packaged object if
the file is referenced only by UNC and the filename. For example, if your
command line is \\SERVERNAME\SHARENAME\FILENAME.BMP, Paintbrush fails with the
above error message.

UNC redirection is supported by Microsoft LAN Manager versions 1.1 and later, and
by 100-percent LAN Manager compatible networks.

The same command for a Write, Notepad, Cardfile, or Calendar file works
correctly. Paintbrush only works correctly if you reference the file using a
valid drive letter, or use the UNC path as a parameter to PBRUSH.EXE.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Open Program Manager.

2. From the File menu, choose Run.

3. On the command line, type:

   pbrush.exe \\servername\sharename\filename.bmp

This can be added to a package when using Object Packager to reference a
Paintbrush file on a network server.
