The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Windows version 3.1 Setup program to add or remove selected
Windows components that are being run within Windows. However, if you remove
components that created .INI files (such as Mail version 3.0 and Schedule+
version 1.0), the associated .INI files are not deleted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you remove a Windows component, you should back up, then delete the
associated .INI file. This ensures that when the component is added back into
Windows, it installs with defaults.

You do not need to delete the .INI file when you replace corrupt .EXE or .HLP
files for a component.
