======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows versions 1991 edition, 1992 edition 
 - Microsoft Cinemania for Windows 1992 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you double-click an icon for a multimedia application that uses Viewer 1.0
while WinFax Pro version 2.0 from Delrina Technology, Inc. is running, the
application will not start. Bookshelf or Cinemania should start if you disable
WinFax. If Bookshelf or Cinemania still does not start, remove any reference to
WinFax from the WIN.INI LOAD= line or the Startup group in the Windows Program
Manager.

Workarounds
-----------

WinFax Pro contains a .DLL named VIEWER.DLL. Bookshelf for Windows and Cinemania
also contain a file named VIEWER.EXE. There are three possible workarounds for
this problem.

 - Upgrade to WinFax Pro version 3.0, which corrects this problem.

   -or-

 - Shutdown WinFax Pro before running the multimedia applications.

   -or-

 - Rename VIEWER.EXE to VIEW.EXE (or any legal MS-DOS filename). This allows
   both programs to run simultaneously. However, renaming VIEWER.EXE to VIEW.EXE
   (or any legal MS-DOS filename) causes QuickKeys to fail because QuickKeys is
   hard coded to look for VIEWER.EXE. (Note: This workaround is not applicable
   to the Word for Windows & Bookshelf, Multimedia Edition. Word for Windows
   is hard coded to look for VIEWER.EXE.

NOTE: Another possible workaround is to upgrade to Bookshelf 1993. Bookshelf 1993
uses MVIEWER2.EXE instead of VIEWER.EXE.
