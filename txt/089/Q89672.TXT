 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01

To import dates into FoxBASE+/MAC from a text file, the dates must be
in year-month-day order and include the century. For example, 19920823
represents August 23, 1992.

If dates in the file are in month/day/year (08/23/92) format, modify
the structure of the database to place the date into a character data
field, ten characters long. Import the text file into the database,
then modify the database structure and change the field to the date
field type.
