-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) computers are unable to browse (view) LAN Manager
1.x server names in the Connect Network Drive, Connect Network Printer, and
Select Computer dialog boxes. In addition, you cannot view servers in Workgroup
Connections by using the NET VIEW \\Servername command.

This is because LAN Manager 1.x does not use domains.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LAN Manager version 2.0 was the first version to create domains for groups of
users. Because LAN Manager 1.x does not use domains, Windows for Workgroups
cannot tell that domains exist unless explicitly told. To access LAN Manager 1.x
servers in Windows for Workgroups, manually type the path to the network
resource in the dialog box.
