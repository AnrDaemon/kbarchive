The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When installing Windows for Workgroups on a computer that has either a removable
hard drive, such as Bernoulli or SyQuest, or is using disk compression software,
such as Stacker, Double Disk, or SpeedStor, the MS-DOS level Windows for
Workgroups network files are installed to the root of drive C.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Removable Hard Drives
---------------------

The Windows for Workgroups Setup program cannot determine whether the removable
hard drive will be present at all times.

Disk Compression Software
-------------------------

Windows for Workgroups Setup does not know when the compressed volume will be
mounted; therefore, it copies the MS-DOS level network drivers to the root of
drive C. Some of these files include:

   WORKGRP.SYS
   PROTMAN.EXE
   PROH.MSG
   PROTMAN.DOS
   PROTOCOL.INI

NOTE: Depending on the specific Windows for Workgroups configuration, there may
also be other .DOS or .EXE files that will be required for Windows for
Workgroups to operate properly.

These files should not be moved from the directory in which the Windows for
Workgroups installation program placed them. Relocating these files is not
reliable and is known to cause problems in some configurations.
