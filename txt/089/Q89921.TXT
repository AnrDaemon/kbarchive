SUMMARY
=======

The following questions and answers pertain to applications, executables,
and libraries.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. I have created an application that does not allow me to edit
      my database files. How can I correct this problem?

   A. Mark your database as excluded in the project, then rebuild your
      application. You must distribute these files to your end users.
      Including the database in the project automatically makes these
      files read only.

2. Q. Why can't I build an executable file from within my project?
      The options to do so are dimmed and unavailable.

   A. To build an executable file, you must purchase the Microsoft
      FoxPro Distribution Kit and install it in your FoxPro directory.
      Prior to installing the FoxPro Distribution Kit, make sure that
      the FoxPro files are not marked as read only.

3. Q. When I attempt to build an executable file, I receive the
      error message "Link command failed." How can I correct this
      problem?

   A. If you receive this error message, check the following items:

      a. Make sure that you have enough conventional memory.

      b. Make sure that you have enough disk space.

      c. Increase the number of file handles available to Microsoft
         FoxPro for MS-DOS. To do this, you can increase the FILES
         setting in the CONFIG.SYS file or increase the FILE HANDLES
         setting in the network configuration file.

      d. Make sure that FoxPro can find your COMMAND.COM file.

      e. Make sure that the following files are on your path:
         WLINK8.EXE, PROAPI16.EXE, and FOXSWAP.COM.

      f. If you are running the Extended Version of FoxPro, make
         sure that DOSMEM=ON is not in your CONFIG.FP file.

4. Q. My executable file runs correctly under the development
      version, but I receive the error message "Feature not available"
      under the stand-alone version. How can I correct this problem?

   A. First, check the "Features Not Available" list in the FoxPro
      Distribution Kit documentation. Certain features used for
      development are not available in the applications and
      executables you create. If you still encounter problems, it is
      possible that you are using a macro substitution in your
      program. You must either eliminate the macro substitution or
      include a program that issues the proper command, but is never
      called, in your project. If this problem persists, call
      Microsoft Product Support for FoxPro at (425) 635-7191, Monday
      through Friday, 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. Pacific time, excluding
      holidays.

5. Q. What is the Library Construction Kit and what does it do?

   A. The Library Construction Kit is an application programming
      interface (API) that allows you to extend the capabilities of
      Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS. With this kit, you can create
      function libraries of C and assembly language routines that can
      be called from within FoxPro.
