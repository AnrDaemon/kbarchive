KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error may appear when you start Windows for Workgroups:

   Insufficient memory available

The error message appears in a dialog box with "Windows for Workgroups" in the
title bar.

CAUSE
=====

There are too many drivers listed in the Drivers portion of Control Panel. When
Windows for Workgroups starts, all of these drivers are loaded into conventional
memory, and the amount of conventional memory available is reduced with the
loading of each driver. When there is too little conventional memory for Windows
for Workgroups to load the next driver, an error message appears.

WORKAROUND
==========

The amount of available conventional memory must be increased. You can increase
conventional memory by taking one or a combination of the following actions:

 - Load fewer drivers in the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

 - Load some of the drivers in the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files into high
   memory.

 - Load fewer drivers in the Drivers portion of Control Panel.

 - Set LASTDRIVE (in CONFIG.SYS) to a letter such as J or K, rather than Z.
   Since each letter uses about 100 bytes more memory than the preceding letter,
   limiting the drive letters in this way can prevent the error from occurring.
   (Note that this does limit the number of network drives that you can access.)
