The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In an application developed for the Microsoft Windows environment using a common
dialog box and a dialog box hook function, the hook function is unable to access
global or local variables even though it receives messages.

CAUSE
=====

Because the hook function is not exported in the application's module definition
(.DEF) file, the hook function's data segment is not set correctly when
functions in the common dialog box library (COMMDLG.DLL) call the hook function.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the .DEF file to list the hook function in the EXPORTS section.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
