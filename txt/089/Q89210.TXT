The Linotronic 530 printer driver provided with Microsoft Windows version 3.1
may not allow you to print out an area larger than 9-by-9 inches at high
graphics resolution when you use user-defined paper sizes.

With the Linotronic driver selected with a high graphics resolution and a
document size greater than 9-by-9 inches, the document prints in the lower- left
corner of the paper only. The printout is no larger than the 9-by-9- inch area.

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PSCRIPT.DRV versions 3.5, 3.51,
3.52, 3.53. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.
