-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you exit Microsoft Windows while Bitstream FaceLift version 2.0 is running,
your system may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

Bitstream FaceLift 2.0 uses a cache to store characters it creates. Depending on
the option you specify, FaceLift may be saving this cache to a file on your hard
disk. FaceLift sends a message to inform you that it is writing characters to
the cache. It is this message that conflicts with Windows when you exit to the
MS-DOS command prompt.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the following steps to disable the message that conflicts with Windows when
you exit:

1. Load the FACELIFT.INI file in a text editor (for example, Microsoft Windows
   Notepad).

   NOTE: FACELIFT.INI is in the WINDOWS directory.

2. Under the [Settings] section, change "NoDumpMsg=0" to "NoDumpMsg=1" (without
   the quotation marks).

   NOTE: This line is not case sensitive.

3. Exit and restart Windows so that the changes can take affect.

================
