======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 2.03, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

MS-DOS APPEND.EXE (or APPEND.COM) should not be used with Windows or Windows for
Workgroups. It prevents Windows and Windows-based applications from creating
valid well-formed-path (WFP) names for the files they are using. (A
well-formed-path name is the complete name of a file, including the drive letter
and full path specification, starting from the root directory.)

This article discusses the following:

 - Windows Setup hangs

 - Windows Program Manager and MS-DOS Prompt

 - Windows File Manager

 - Windows applications cannot be found

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows Setup Hangs
-------------------

If APPEND.EXE is loading when running Windows' Setup, then the installation of
Windows may be corrupted. You may also receive error messages such as:

   Error 6

   -or-

   Cannot find file: WIN.SRC

Windows Program Manager and MS-DOS Prompt
-----------------------------------------

You may see the error message "Cannot start application" when you attempt to run
the MS-DOS icon in Windows 3.0 or the MS-DOS Prompt in Windows 3.1 if APPEND.EXE
is loaded in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file as:

   APPEND C:\DOS

Windows File Manager
--------------------

If you are using Windows 3.0 or 3.1 File Manager, while APPEND.EXE is loaded, and
you attempt to format a system disk, you may receive the error message:

   Bad Or Missing Command Interpreter

There will also be problems when attempting to read floppy disks. An example
would be attempting to read drive A, but receiving a directory of drive C.

Windows Applications Cannot be Found
------------------------------------

APPEND.EXE confuses Windows and may prevent Windows from finding applications.
When this occurs, the following error message will be displayed:

   

                    Change Disk
   Cannot find "AppName.EXE", Please insert in drive A:
                      < OK >
