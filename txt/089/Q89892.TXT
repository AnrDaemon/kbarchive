KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you perform an OLE drag and drop function in File Manager while Quick
Recorder is playing a sound, an error message displays stating that there is not
enough memory. This message does not accurately describe the situation.

CAUSE
=====

The error actually occurs because SNDWAVE.DLL file disables the Cut, Copy, and
Paste functions (including OLE drag and drop functions) while it is busy.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only solution is to wait until you have finished playing or recording the
sound, then perform the OLE drag and drop operation.
