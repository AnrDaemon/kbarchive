======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to print from Aldus PageMaker 4.0 desktop publishing software
with Microsoft Windows version 3.1, you may receive the following error
message:

   status: Waiting for the spooler to empty its print buffer.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs only if you use a Windows Print Manager (or a third-party
print spooler) when there is not sufficient space on the hard drive to store
this temporary file(s). If this message appears, the file does not print and the
print job must be terminated.

This error may also occur if the SET TEMP statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
specifies an invalid directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Remove unnecessary files from the hard drive and/or reduce the size of the
   permanent swapfile (if it exists).

2. Make sure that the SET TEMP statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file refers to a
   valid directory. For example, if the following line is in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file

        SET TEMP=C:\WINDOWS\TEMP

   be sure there is a directory on drive C called WINDOWS\TEMP.

3. Turn off Print Manager. This does not solve the problem, but it allows you to
   print until you can create more space on the hard drive.
