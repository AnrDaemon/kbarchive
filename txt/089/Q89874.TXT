-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

During Windows Sound System installation, if the file MIDIMAP.CFG is located in
the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, it is replaced with the Windows Sound System
MIDIMAP.CFG file. Windows Sound System Setup saves a copy of the previous
MIDIMAP.CFG under the filename MIDIMAP.WSS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can replace the Windows Sound System MIDIMAP.CFG file with the original by
renaming the files to their original names. To do this, use the following MS-DOS
commands, and press ENTER after each line:

   rename midimap.cfg midimap.old
   rename midimap.wss midimap.cfg

Because the Windows Sound System does not support multiple sound cards running
under a single installation of Windows, we do not recommend or support the
merging of two .CFG files.
