======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After upgrading to MS-DOS on a Leading Edge Model M 8088 or a Sperry HT 8088
computer, executing QBASIC or EDIT may produce unusual video display behavior
(for example, horizontal scrolling or blinking) or unusual system behavior (for
example, lock-ups).

CAUSE
=====

The Leading Edge Model M and Sperry HT are 8088 machines. They originally
shipped with a color video controller that does not conform to any standard
supported by MS-DOS 5.0 and later (that is, monochrome, CGA, EGA, EGA mono, VGA,
or 8514).

The products included here, Leading Edge Model M and Sperry HT, are manufactured
by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
