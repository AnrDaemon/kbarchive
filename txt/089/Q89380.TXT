SUMMARY
=======

If you have VSAFE virus scanning software on your machine, you should disable
VSAFE from the CONFIG.SYS file and/or the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and restart your
system before installing Windows 3.1. This applies to new installations and
upgrades from Windows 3.0.

After Windows is installed, you may use VSAFE. If you are using SMARTDRV.EXE
version 4.0, load it after VSAFE.

If VSAFE is running when you upgrade to Windows 3.1 from Windows 3.0, you receive
several error messages about the .COM and .EXE files being changed.
