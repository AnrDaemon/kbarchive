SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the printing configurations that Microsoft Windows
supports when you print on a Novell NetWare network.

For testing purposes, Microsoft recommends that you use one of the supported
configurations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Printing to a Printer Connected to Your Computer
------------------------------------------------

Printing to a printer connected by a standard LPT port to your local computer is
a supported configuration

NOTE: This does NOT mean that one workstation can print to a printer connected to
another workstation; this configuration is not supported. To print from one
workstation to another under NetWare a value-added-process (VAP) is needed, such
as RPRINTER, LANSpool, PS-Print, Hot Print, and Network Assistant Plus. For
support for using these products, contact the manufacturer.

Printing to a Printer Connected to a Dedicated Server
-----------------------------------------------------

Printing to a printer connected to a dedicated server is a supported
configuration.

NOTE: This does NOT mean a server that is both a workstation and a server. If it
is, then it is a non-dedicated server and the configuration is not supported.

Printing to a Printer Connected to a Dedicated Print Server
-----------------------------------------------------------

Printing to a printer connected to a dedicated print server is also supported.

If you are attempting to print in a different configuration, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   "tshoot" (without the quotation marks) and "printsharing" (without the
   quotation marks)
