TITLE   :Changes to Wrong File when Switching Tasks in Quick Recorder
PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Windows Products
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you are using the Quick Recorder Compression dialog box, and you switch to
the OLE application, play the sound object, and switch back to Quick Recorder,
Quick Recorder saves any compression changes in the OLE sound object instead of
the file open in Quick Recorder.

This problem only occurs when you are in the Quick Recorder Compression dialog
box and you switch to, and back from, an OLE client application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Run Quick Recorder.

2. Open a .WAV file.

3. From the Options menu, choose Compression.

4. Open an OLE client that has an embedded sound object.

5. Open the sound object in the OLE client.

6. Switch the focus back to Quick Recorder (the compression dialog box should
   still be active).

7. Change the compression.

8. Choose the OK button.

9. Close Quick Recorder.

Quick Recorder indicates that the embedded sound object has changed and asks if
you want to save the changes. This is incorrect because you attempted to change
the compression for the file loaded in Quick Recorder, but the changes were made
to the embedded sound object.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows Sound System Quick
Recorder version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.
