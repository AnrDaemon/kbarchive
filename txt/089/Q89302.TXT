======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your system may behave erratically while running Windows in 386 enhanced mode
while set up for LANtastic 4.x. When you attempt to access the network, (for
example, by clicking on a network drive in File Manager), the system may stop
responding (hang) or exit to the MS-DOS command prompt.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, make the following changes to the [386Enh] section of
your SYSTEM.INI file:

 - Decrease the NetAsynchTimeOut= value from 50 to 5.

 - Add the line "device=LANTASTI.386" (without the quotation marks)

You should also confirm that your LANtastic directory is in your path.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you installed the LANtastic 4.x driver that ships with Windows 3.1, then
NetAsynchTimeOut=50 was placed in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
Installing the LANtastic 4.1 driver from the [drive]:\LANTASTI directory
correctly adds NetAsynchTimeOut=5. Changing the NetAsynchTimeOut= setting from
50 to 5 seems to resolve the erratic problems encountered when accessing the
network.
