SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a general listing of Artisoft LANtastic cards and their
use with Windows for Workgroups.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Artisoft's 2Mbps Card (also known as the AEX Card, and most often packaged with
the LANtastic Starter Kit) DO NOT work with Windows for Workgroups. These are
proprietary cards that are designed with a NetBIOS chip on the card itself. This
design does not work with a network driver interface specification (NDIS)
compliant driver.

The following cards have NDIS drivers supplied with Windows for Workgroups and
are supported:

 - AE-1 Ethernet Card

 - AE-2 Ethernet Card

 - AE-3 Ethernet Card

 - Noderunner 2000

All the above network cards can emulate an NE1000. The AE-2 and AE-3 can also be
configured to emulate an NE2000. However, emulation for the AE-2 and AE-3 is
configured through setting physical jumpers on the network card. Specific
instructions for jumper settings can be found in Artisoft's documentation.

Artisoft's Noderunner 2000 card is configurable through the NRCONFIG.EXE program.
This adapter works with the NE2000-compatible driver in Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11.
