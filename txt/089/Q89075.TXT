-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing or running Digital Communications Associates' (DCA) IRMA
Workstation for Windows, your computer may lock or freeze. This usually occurs
when running the IRMA COMMCHK program and when:

 - The IRMA card is not found

 - There is a hardware conflict with the IRMA card

CAUSE
=====

The IRMA Card Is Not Found
--------------------------

The DCA IRMA Workstation for Windows may not recognize or detect your IRMA card
on an IBM 40 PS/2 with Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1.

If this problem occurs, you need to obtain the Configuration Diagnostic Disk
version 2.1 from DCA.

There Is a Hardware Conflict with the IRMA Card
-----------------------------------------------

The IRMA card needs a unique Base I/O Address, UMA address, and IRQ. If there is
another card attempting to use these areas, then the IRMA card will not function
properly.

DCA IRMA Workstations for Windows is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
