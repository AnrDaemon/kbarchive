SUMMARY
=======

The D2N.BAT and N2D.BAT files shipped with the Windows SDK provide a way to
switch between the retail and debug kernels of Windows within the same
installation. One problem with this approach is that the entire kernel of
Windows gets swapped during the copying process. This article describes a way to
use the debug and retail kernel at the same time with much less overhead
involved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps are involved to provide coexisting debug and retail
installations of Windows:

1. Make a copy of the SYSTEM.INI file (for example, copy it to SYSTEM.RET).

2. Copy renamed versions of the debug kernel .EXE files to your Windows system
   directory (for example, copy GDI.EXE from the debug subdirectory of the SDK
   disks to GDIDBG.EXE in the Windows subdirectory).

3. In SYSTEM.INI, add the following lines to the [boot] section:

         gdi.exe = gdidbg.exe
         <add lines for the updated USER.EXE, KRNL286.EXE, KRNL386.EXE
         and MMSYSTEM.DLL files>

4. Make a copy of the new SYSTEM.INI file (for example, copy it to SYSTEM.DBG).

Now you can switch between the debug and retail kernels just by copying
SYSTEM.DBG or SYSTEM.RET to SYSTEM.INI before booting Windows.

Notice that this technique does not work for the debugging version of WIN386.EXE
because that file actually reads SYSTEM.INI. To install the debug version of
WIN386.EXE, you still need to replace WIN.386 with the version that is being
shipped with the Windows Device Development Kit.
