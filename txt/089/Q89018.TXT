MORE INFORMATION
================

ROM Version
-----------

The NEC LC-890 should have ROM version 47.0, revision 2.0 or later for proper
operation with Windows. The ROM revision number is printed on the page when the
LC-890 does a self-test. Using an earlier ROM version may cause clipped text
when printing from Notepad or Calendar.

Batch Mode
----------

The NEC LC-890 PostScript printer may print black boxes in areas instead of
graphics when set to interactive mode. The LC-890 must be set to batch mode to
print graphics in Windows. According to NEC, interactive mode should only be
used by programmers. Programmers can send codes to the printer and receive
messages back from the printer when in interactive mode. NEC recommends the
batch mode setting for normal use.

Wait State
----------

There are four control-panel buttons on the front of the NEC LC-890 to change
settings: ONLINE, MENU, NEXT, and SELECT. There is also an LCD menu display.

To change the wait state (time-out) to infinite, do the following:

1. Press the ONLINE button to toggle the printer off line.

2. Press the MENU button. The LCD reads "Setup Test Setup."

3. Press the SELECT button, then press the NEXT button twice. The LCD reads
   "Setup Miscellaneous."

4. Press the SELECT button, then press the NEXT button. The LCD reads "Set Wait
   Time."

5. Press the SELECT button; the Wait Time-Outs is displayed. The available
   options are 5 seconds, 15 seconds, 30 seconds, and Infinite.

6. Press the NEXT button until "Infinite" is displayed.

7. Press the ONLINE button.
