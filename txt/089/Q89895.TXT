The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With Windows for Workgroups Mail, the Workgroup Postoffice can be set up from
one computer to another computer across the network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Assume the following in this example of a remotely created and administered
Workgroups Postoffice:

 - The postoffice is set up and administered from machine 1.

 - The postoffice files are actually kept on machine 2.

   NOTE: The user on machine 1 is the Post Office Manager, but the postoffice
   files are stored on Machine 2

 - Machine 1 is a Windows for Workgroups machine.

 - Machine 2 is a machine with server/sharing capabilities, such as a Windows
   for Workgroups machine, a LAN Manager 2.1 server, or a Novell server.

   NOTE: Novell servers require some special attention. For more information,
   query on the following in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   novell and netware and server and wgpo

After Windows for Workgroups setup is complete on machine 1, the designated
administrator of the Workgroups Mail postoffice should take the following
steps:

1. On machine 1, from the Main group, start Workgroups Mail.

2. Choose Create A New Workgroup Postoffice.

3. To connect to machine 2, choose the Network button.

   If Machine 2 is a Windows for Workgroups machine or a LAN Manager 2.1 server,
   type the server name and share name (that is, \\server\share) where you want
   the postoffice created, then choose the OK button.

   NOTE: You must have access rights to the \\server\share.

   If Machine 2 is a Novell server, you must be logged onto the Novell server and
   have the correct permissions. Then you should connect to the server using one
   of these conventions:

   server/share:directory
   \\server\share\directory
   remapped drive:\directory

   For more information on the Novell naming conventions, check your Novell
   NetWare documentation.

4. After the Workgroup Postoffice has been created, check to ensure that the
   postoffice is shared properly on machine 2.
