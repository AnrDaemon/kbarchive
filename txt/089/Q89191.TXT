The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the system attribute is set to "on" for the WIN.INI file, File Manager for
Windows 3.1 displays garbled information. Directory and filenames may contain
random characters, invalid filenames, numerical strings, or files may be
displayed as directories in the file window.

To resolve this problem, turn the system attribute for WIN.INI off by typing the
following at the MS-DOS command line:

   ATTRIB -S WIN.INI

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some of the effects noted are:

 - The file dates may be invalid, for example "8/0/=1."

 - Total disk space may be an invalid number, such as "-1,382,993,828 bytes
   total."

 - The volume name may be garbled or nonexistent.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11
