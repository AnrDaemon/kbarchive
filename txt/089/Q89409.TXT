SUMMARY
=======

ADMD is the abbreviation for ADministration Management Domain. This term is
defined by the CCITT X.400 standard which defines the basis for a unified,
world-wide, electronic mail (e-mail) network. The network functions through the
cooperation of independent operators of public and private e-mail systems, each
of whom manages a separate domain. No single international authority,
government, company, or other body assigns names and addresses to the network.

X.400 defines a two-level domain structure. Level-1 domains are termed ADMD and
level-2 domains are termed PRMD (PRivate Management Domain). As stated in
section 7.3.3 of the F.400 standard:

   In one country one or more ADMDs can exist. An ADMD is characterized by its
   provision of relaying functions between other Management Domains and the
   provision of Message Transfer Service for the applications provided within
   the ADMD

A PRMD "is characterized by the provision of messaging functions" with the domain
(F.400, section 7.3.4).

Typically, a company or organization operates a PRMD to facilitate communications
within a local organization and uses an ADMD to serve as the e-mail hub between
sites, either within the same country or internationally. If the PRMDs use the
transfer services of different ADMDs, or access mailboxes in the ADMDs, each
ADMD must be linked. This link could be direct or a relay through another ADMD.

The X.400 standard discusses administrations because CCITT is part of the
International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a United Nations organization.
CCITT groups governmental bodies (another name for administrations). However, a
number of private companies operate ADMDs and the number of companies grows as
the postal, telephone, and telegraph (PTT) authorities are sold to private
investors.
