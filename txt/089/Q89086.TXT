The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information applies to Microsoft Windows operating system running
with a DNA network. DNA is an unsupported network. This article includes the
following topics:

 - Setup for Microsoft or 100-percent compatible system

 - Network board software needs to be revision H for Windows 3.1

 - Installing on DNA's propriety boards

 - Persistent network connections

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setup for Microsoft or 100-Percent Compatible
---------------------------------------------

Windows must be installed as "Microsoft or 100% Compatible" when prompted for the
network configuration.

Network Board Software Needs to be Revision H for Windows 3.1
-------------------------------------------------------------

Running Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 under the DNA Networks
software may produce some problems unless you have updated to version 3.38 (Rev.
H) of DNA Networks proprietary boards or to version 5.02 (Rev. H) of NetBIOS
boards.

The following problems occur without the update:

 - When running Setup /N from a workstation without a hard drive, the "Install
   Applications" section of Setup can only modify the path, not the drive.

 - After entering either the graphical portion of Setup or when running Windows,
   floppy drive A no longer is accessible and may cause of the following error
   messages:

    - Current drive is no longer valid.

    - Cannot load COMMAND.COM.

    - Insert disk with batch file.

 - Network directories may not display in the following applications' dialog
   boxes:

    - AMI PRO version 2.0

    - Versions 2.1d and 3.0 of Microsoft Excel for Windows

    - Version 2.0 of Microsoft Word for Windows

    - WordPerfect version 5.1

Installing on DNA's Proprietary Boards
--------------------------------------

If you are installing on DNA's proprietary boards (as opposed to NetBIOS boards
such as EtherNet), the following information applies:

1. If you are using DNA's MegaNet board, Windows must be told not to use the
   same area in memory that the board uses for the MegaNet Window (a 16K page).
   To find out which page is being used, start the machine without loading any
   memory managers and read the DNA device driver banner. If it is says MegaNet,
   then note which page it says it is using. Exclude this page from Windows by
   adding an EMMEXCLUDE= entry to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
   For example, if the DNA banner reads

   MegaNet, RAM Window=C000

   then add EMMEXCLUDE=C000-C3FF to the SYSTEM.INI file.

   If the DNA banner reads

   MegaNet, RAM Window=C800

   then add EMMEXCLUDE=C800-CBFF to the SYSTEM.INI file.

2. Each machine that is running Windows should be using the DNA program
   WINFIX.COM. WINFIX.COM should be installed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and can
   be found on DNA distribution disk 1 in the FIXES subdirectory. This will keep
   DNA from displaying the error

   Unsupported NetBIOS call

   when Windows is executed. It will also allow Windows to properly detect
   network printers and drives that have been redirected over the DNA network.

3. DNA networks do not support Windows running in 386 enhanced mode as the
   master (server) if a DNA MegaNet board is installed running in MegaNet mode
   (the board is using a RAM window). Windows can still be run in 386 enhanced
   mode at workstations.

4. Print Manager functions are not supported. The DNA network utilities
   PRINT.SYS and SPOOL.SYS (together with the SPOOL command) provide the same
   functionality.

Persistent Network Connections
------------------------------

If you are using DNA network software on a machine without a hard disk, and you
are using persistent network connections under Windows 3.1, you may not be able
to use drive A after Windows is started. You will need to restart the computer
to gain access to drive A.

DNA has confirmed this to be a problem with its network driver. An updated driver
can be obtained from DNA.

To disable persistent network connections:

1. Run Control Panel.

2. Choose the Network icon.

3. Clear the Restore All Connections At Startup check box.

4. Choose the OK button to save your changes.
