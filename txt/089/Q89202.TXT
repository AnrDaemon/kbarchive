SUMMARY
=======

The spelling checker in Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Creative Writer
versions 1.0 and 1.1 do not handle some abbreviated words correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, the spelling checker marks the abbreviation "etc." as a misspelled
word. In the Spelling dialog box, it appears as "etc" (no period). If you choose
Suggest, the spelling checker will offer "etc." (with a period) as the
correction. If you accept this as the correction, you will end up with "etc.."
(two periods) as the corrected word.

If you check the spelling in the presentation again, "etc" will again be found as
having no period; if you again accept the offered correction, you will end up
with three periods. This continues to occur for as many times as you spell check
the presentation.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
