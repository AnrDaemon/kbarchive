 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To disable the Startup group from functioning in Windows for Workgroups, press
the SHIFT key immediately after the login prompt.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, the Startup group is used to
load applications automatically when starting Windows. You can disable these
programs by holding down the SHIFT key as Windows loads. Because Windows for
Workgroups prompts you for a case-sensitive password when loading, you must
enter your password before holding down the SHIFT key to disable the Startup
group.

If warnings or error messages appear after you type your password, respond
appropriately while holding down the SHIFT key.

NOTE: Since Windows for Workgroups checks to see if the SHIFT key has been
pressed immediately after the logon prompt, you may need to press the SHIFT key
while you press OK or ENTER in response to that prompt. Then continue to hold
down the SHIFT key to prevent starting applications.
