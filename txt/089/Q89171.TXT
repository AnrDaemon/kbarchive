The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information on Invisible Software's product Invisible
Network and its use with Microsoft Windows 3.0 and 3.1. The following topics are
included:

 - Using Invisible Network with Windows 3.0

 - Using Invisible Network with Windows 3.1

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using Invisible Network with Windows 3.0
----------------------------------------

Invisible Network provides nondedicated MS-DOS server operation in a peer-to-peer
environment. It will only function with Invisible Software's proprietary
Ethernet or twisted pair network adapters.

Setup
-----

Invisible Network 2.21a or later should be used. It will be detected by Windows
3.0 as "IBM PC LAN," provided that the network was loaded before the Windows
Setup program is run, and that the /I parameter (used to disable Windows
automatic hardware detection) is not being used. This is the correct choice for
this network.

Printing
--------

Printing over the network to a shared printer should work correctly using LPT1:,
LPT2:, or LPT3:. It has been noted, however, that the Windows Print Manager
displays the message

   A general network error has occurred.

In addition,

   [NETWORK ERROR]

is displayed on the status line for the redirected printer. For this reason, it
is recommended that you disable the use of the Print Manager by choosing the
Printers icon from the Control Panel and clearing the Use Print Manager check
box.

WARNING: If a job is printed while the Print Manager is in a restored state (not
minimized), the workstation hangs. This is an additional reason to disable the
Print Manager. Invisible Software is researching this problem.

386 Enhanced Mode
-----------------

386 enhanced mode is not recommended at this time on any machine that is
designated as a server (that is, any machine that shares a printer and/or disk
service). Workstations can run 386 enhanced mode.

Invisible Software recommends adding the following entries to the [386enh]
section of the Windows SYSTEM.INI file on workstations running in 386 enhanced
mode:

      network=*vnetbios,*dosnet
      FileSysChange=off
      InDOSPolling=TRUE
      INT28Critical=TRUE
      ReflectDosInt2A=FALSE
      UniqueDOSPSP=FALSE
      LPT1AutoAssign=0
      LPT2AutoAssign=0
      LPT3AutoAssign=0
      PerVMFiles=0

Additionally, you may need to add the line

      EMMExclude=XXXX-YYYY

where XXXX is the beginning address and YYYY is the ending address of the network
adapter in the reserved memory area.

Using Invisible Network with Windows 3.1
----------------------------------------

To run the Invisible Network with Windows 3.1, you must use version 3.13.

Steps to Install Invisible Network into Windows 3.1
---------------------------------------------------

1. Run Windows 3.1.

2. From the File menu, choose Run.

3. Type "setup" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

4. From the Options menu, choose Change System Settings.
