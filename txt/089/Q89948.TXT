SUMMARY
=======

Windows Sound System Sound Finder does not start minimized if you use
SHIFT+double click or SHIFT+ENTER to start it from the Program Manager group.

There is no workaround for this behavior. You must manually minimize Sound
Finder. You should not place Sound Finder in the Startup group unless you want
to use it maximized when starting Windows.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows Sound System Sound
Finder version 1.0 and 1.0a. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.
