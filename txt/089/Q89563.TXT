SUMMARY
=======

SetParent() can be used to change the parent window of a pop-up, overlapped, or
child window. However, pop-up and overlapped windows were not designed to have a
parent and they may function incorrectly if they are given a parent using
SetParent. For example, messages like "WM_ACTIVATEAPP" that are sent only to
top-level windows, will not be sent to a pop-up or overlapped window that has
been given a parent. Child windows can be safely re-parented.

The process that created the parent window can be the same as, or different than
the process that created the window that is being re-parented.
