-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Novell NetWare connectivity under Windows for Workgroups,
you may receive one of the following error messages:

   Memory is insufficient to run KRNL386.EXE

   -or-

   WINDOWMEMSIZE is too large in SYSTEM.INI

CAUSE
=====

These error messages occur in the following situations:

 - After you manually remove the Novell NetWare drivers from your CONFIG.SYS and
   AUTOEXEC.BAT files instead of removing them using Control Panel

   -or-

 - When you load PC Tools or PC-DOS RAMBoost from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file

If you remove the Novell NetWare drivers from the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
files, the network card fails to bind because the PROTOCOL.INI file is still set
up for Novell connectivity.

NOTE: This problem may also occur if you run QEMM and load high. his may also
occur if HP Explorer is loading high.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are running QEMM and programs in the high memory area (HMA), try loading
the programs in low memory. If the symptoms persist, try using HIMEM.SYS.

If you are running RAMBoost, remove the command from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and
restart your computer.
