======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Adaptec's ASPI4DOS.SYS driver versions 3.0 or earlier, you may
experience problems executing File Manager within Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups or Microsoft Windows 3.1. After you start File Manager, the cursor
may remain as an hourglass and the system may subsequently stop responding
(hang).

Your system may also stop (hang) when you attempt to save files.

CAUSE
=====

Adaptec's 1542B SCSI controller card requires ASPI4DOS.SYS driver version 3.0a
or later to operate correctly with version 3.1 of Microsoft Windows or Windows
for Workgroups.

ASPI4DOS.SYS, version 3.0, works correctly with Microsoft Windows version 3.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

You need to obtain an updated driver from Adaptec. Contact Adaptec to obtain the
latest driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you attempt to share a CD-ROM drive on a Windows for Workgroups machine, and
you experience frequent system hangs, VSERVER errors or general protection (GP)
faults, check your ASPI4DOS.SYS driver. It may be too new for your system BIOS.

ASPI4DOS.SYS drivers dated 6/91 or earlier do not work with MS-DOS versions
greater than 3.0.


For more information on ASPI4DOS.SYS, contact Adaptec technical support.
