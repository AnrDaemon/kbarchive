SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Word for Windows, certain actions may update fields in the header
or footer of a document, but these same actions will not update the fields in
the main body of the document.

Automatic updates are not retained until you save the document.

NOTE: You can manually update the fields in the main body of the document by
pressing F9 from within the field.
