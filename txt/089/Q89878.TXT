SUMMARY
=======

SoundScapes, a component of the Windows Sound System, works by setting a timer
to play a sound. Note the following:

 - If a sound is playing when the timer event occurs, SoundScapes does not play
   an additional sound.

 - If a sound is not playing, SoundScapes generates a random number from 0 to 99
   and compares it to the "chance" of a sound being played (chance is an entry
   in the CONTROL.INI file). If the random value is less than the chance, then
   SoundScapes randomly selects one of the sounds from the sound list and plays
   it at a random volume level unless position=0, in which case SoundScapes
   always plays at the same volume.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SoundScapes gets its information from the CONTROL.INI file in the Windows
directory. The important fields are:

   [SoundScapes]
   current=<soundscape name of current scape>
   Environment00=<first soundscape>
   Environment01=<second soundscape>
   Environment<??>=<last soundscape>
   Volume=<volume level from 0 to 255, 255 being loudest>
   PWProtected=<0 if there's no password protection; 1 if there is>
   Path=<directory for the soundscape sounds>

Each SoundScapes sound has an entry similar to the following:

   [SndScape.<soundscape name>]
   Numsounds=<number of sounds in the soundscape>
   Chance=<chance out of 100 of playing a sound every "Time" seconds>
   Time=<Number of seconds between timer clicks>
   Position=<1 if a random volume level is chosen; 0 to use maximum
   volume all the time>
   sound00=<first wave file>
   sound01=<second wave file>
   sound<# sounds - 1>=<last wave file>
