SUMMARY
=======

The FILTER COMMAND can be slow on networks because the filter is evaluated each
time the record pointer is moved. Using a filtered index can help to improve
performance.

Extensive use of macro substitution slows down any program. It does not matter if
the program is running single-user or multi-user.

Using a math coprocessor helps to increase speed in math-intensive programs and
helps to increase speed in drawing screens.

Changing the settings of the "bucket," "hmemory," and "mvarsiz" values in the
CONFIG.FX file can help to maximize the use of available memory and to increase
processing speed. See the chapter on Configurable Allocation Items in the
FoxBASE+ "User's Guide" for more information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because FoxBASE+ has its own internal cache, using another cache program is not
recommended. Certain cache routines may not follow the standard, which may lead
to database corruption.
