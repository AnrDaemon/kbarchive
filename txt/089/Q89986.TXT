SUMMARY
=======

Windows Sound System supports Windows-based applications that have built-in
sound and conform to the Windows 3.1 Software Development Kit (SDK).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows Sound System supports Windows software that uses waveform (.WAV) and
MIDI (.MID or .RMI) audio written for Windows 3.1 or Windows with Multimedia
Extensions 1.0. Windows Sound System supports MS-DOS-based software written for
Adlib or Sound Blaster cards only. Sound Blaster support requires configuration
through Windows Control Panel or by running the GAMECNFG.EXE program that comes
with Windows Sound System 2.0.

Windows Sound System uses installable device drivers for wave-out, wave-in,
MIDI-out, and auxiliary audio. Windows-based software can access all these types
using standard Windows 3.1 audio API calls.

The following restrictions apply to the wave-in and wave-out API support:

 - Simultaneous record and playback of audio is not possible with the current
   driver (version 1.0).

 - Only mono/stereo playback is possible.

 - Only 16/8-bit linear PCM playback is possible without the use of the Audio
   Compression Manager (ACM) module. (Mu-law and A-law are not supported in
   version 1.0).

 - The following sampling rates are directly supported by the board. Other ones
   can be achieved through the ACM module:

      5510, 6620, 8000, 9600, 11025, 16000, 18900, 22050, 27420,
      32000, 33075, 37800, 44100, 48000

The following restrictions apply to the MIDI-out support:

 - Only 12 simultaneous voices (including drums) are supported.

 - The patches are General MIDI compliant.

 - Each voice is either entirely on the left, right, or both channels; there is
   no fading.

 - The only MIDI messages used are:

   Note on/off
   Program change
   Pitch bend
   Balance
   Volume level
