SYMPTOMS
========

When running Windows on Novell NetWare, you may receive the following error
message:

   Cannot load a device specified in the initialization file for Windows in 386
   enhanced mode. The performance of Windows will not be affected.
   C:\WINDOWS\system\vnetware.386 VIPX: Device load failed. IPX is not installed
   or not the right version.

   Press any key to continue ...

This error is caused by one of the following conditions:

 - IPX.COM is not the correct version.

 - The VIPX.386 file located in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory is not the correct
   version.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IPX.COM Is Not the Correct Version
----------------------------------

To check the version of IPX being used, exit Windows and type "IPX I" at the
MS-DOS command prompt. The IPX version for Windows 3.1 should be 3.10. The IPX
version for Windows 3.0 should be at least 3.02a. If you have an earlier IPX
version, you must generate a new IPX.COM file. Please refer to your system
administrator or your Novell manual for the process.

VIPX.386 Located in WINDOWS\SYSTEM Directory Is Not Correct Version
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Search the entire hard drive and make sure the only VIPX.386 file on the system
is located in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory, and is the same date as the rest of
the Windows files.

For more information on VIPX.386 version requirements, query on the following
