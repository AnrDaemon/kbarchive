The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you run the Microsoft Diagnostic Utility (MSD.EXE) or MEM /D under
Windows in 386 enhanced mode, no matter what extended memory specification
(XMS) driver version you are using in your CONFIG.SYS file, MSD.EXE and MEM
/D always report the driver version as 2.05 and the XMS version as 2.0.

When Windows starts in 386 enhanced mode, the functionality provided by
HIMEM.SYS is taken over by the Windows memory manager (WIN386.EXE) and it
conforms to XMS version 2.0.
