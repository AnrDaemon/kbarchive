SUMMARY
=======

The following information applies to the APPEND command in FoxBASE+:

 - The APPEND BLANK command locks only the file header.

 - The APPEND FROM command does not support the dBASE III PLUS IMPORT/EXPORT
   command. However, the APPEND FROM and COPY TO commands support reading and
   creating ASCII text files with TYPE DELIMITED or TYPE SDF. FoxBASE+ does not
   directly support importing and exporting DIF, SYLK, or other file types.

 - To load a DATE field type from an ASCII field with the APPEND FROM command,
   the date must be stored as YYYYMMDD.

 - The APPEND FROM command cannot import a memo field.

 - The APPEND FROM SDF command loads fixed-length records that are separated by
   spaces in a columnar form. Records are delimited by a carriage return and a
   linefeed pair.

 - The APPEND FROM DELIMITED command uses quotation marks to delimit character
   fields in an ASCII text file, unless the SET DELIMITER TO command specifies a
   different delimiter. Commas separate the fields, unless the TYPE BLANK
   command specifies that fields are separated by blanks.
