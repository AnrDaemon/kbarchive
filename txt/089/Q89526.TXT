The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

When you install the Windows Productivity Pack 3.1 on removable media, such as a
Bernoulli or SyQuest drive, you receive the following error message:

   The location you have chosen to install Microsoft Productivity Pack is
   invalid or not allowed. Please check the drive and/or directory name.

This message appears even if Windows is installed on the removable drive and
there is sufficient disk space.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setup only allows you to install on a fixed disk. When you install Windows
Productivity Pack 3.1 on removable media, such as a Bernoulli or Syquest drive,
SETUP.EXE fails. Setup incorrectly assumes that you are installing to a floppy
disk, and determines that there is insufficient disk space for the
installation.

This was tested with the Bernoulli driver RCD.SYS 7.0 and 7.04.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Install Productivity Pack to a directory on a fixed disk.

2. Create a new ProdPack directory on the removable drive and copy the files
   from the fixed disk directory to the new directory.

3. Change Program Item Properties to reflect the new program location. You
   receive this message:

   The specified path points to a file that may not be available during later
   Windows sessions. Do you want to continue?

4. Choose OK to dismiss this message.
