SUMMARY
=======

Windows Sound System Quick Recorder incorrectly creates 256-color bitmaps for
its sound files. If you drag a picture icon into another program, such as
Paintbrush, the image is displayed as a black box. If you want to use picture
icons created in Quick Recorder, use 16-color images.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows Sound System Quick
Recorder versions 1.0 and 1.0a. This problem was corrected in Windows Sound
System version 2.0.
