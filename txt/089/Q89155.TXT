SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft PowerPoint, the pattern of an object fill shows through between the
lines of a double-line style border.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no way to prevent this problem from occurring. However, you can use the
following workaround to prevent the pattern of an object fill from showing
between the lines of a double-line style border:

1. Draw a shape (rectangle, square, or circle) and fill it with the pattern fill
   you want. Set the line style for the Border to No Line, or None.

2. Draw a second object on top of the first object. It should be of the same
   shape, only slightly larger.

3. Format the second object as unfilled and select the double-line style border
   you want.

The pattern-filled object should show through the unfilled, framed object. If the
two are positioned correctly, they should look like a single framed, filled
object. You can even select both of them and use the Group option in the Arrange
menu to turn them into a single object. Using this workaround, the pattern will
not show through between the lines of the double-line style border.
