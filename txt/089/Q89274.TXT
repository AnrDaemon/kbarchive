MORE INFORMATION
================

Version Required for Windows 3.0
--------------------------------

Windows 3.0 requires a PC LAN network version 1.32 or later.

No File Manager Connections in Windows 3.0
------------------------------------------

In Windows 3.0, all network connections should be made before starting Windows.
File Manager cannot connect to PC LAN network shares.

Requires InDOSPolling=True
--------------------------

When running PC LAN with Windows 3.0 and 3.1, you must add the following line to
the SYSTEM.INI file's [386enh] section:

   InDOSPolling=True

Broadcast Message May Hang Workstation
--------------------------------------

On some versions of PC LAN, network broadcast messages may hang the workstation
receiving them. If this is the case, then either disable broadcast messages or
contact your vendor for an updated version.

For more information on this topic, please refer to the NETWORKS.WRI file that
comes with Windows 3.1.

Controlling Multiple Sessions
-----------------------------

You can have up to 255 files open on a PC LAN server. To successfully open this
many files, files=255 must be set in the CONFIG.SYS file of the server. Because
Windows keeps 14 files open on the server, the maximum number of Windows
sessions that can be run from the PC LAN server is around 18, provided no other
files are open on the server:

   sessions = 255/14 = 18

The 255-file limitation is a limitation of MS-DOS. Servers that run on different
operating systems such as OS/2 do not experience this same limitation.

The IBM PC LAN product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
