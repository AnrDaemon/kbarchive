TITLE   :Changing Computer's Role Causes Workstation to Not Start
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

If you change a server's role from backup or primary to standalone and back
again (as when you synchronize the user accounts database) services such as the
Remote Access Service (RAS) no longer start.

CAUSE
=====

When a server's role is changed to standalone, the Netlogon Service is removed.
(You can confirm this by looking at the srvservices line in the LANMAN.INI
file.) When the role is changed to backup or primary, the Netlogon service is
added, but it is added to the end of the srvservices line in the LANMAN.INI
file, so all services before Netlogon are started first. Some services such as
the Remote Access Service require Netlogon to be running before they can start,
so they fail to start, preventing the workstation from starting.

RESOLUTION
==========

After switching roles on a server (for example, backup -> standalone ->
backup), examine the LANMAN.INI file and make sure that the Netlogon service is
listed before any other service, such as RAS.
