-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to start Norton's Utility version 6.01 Directory Sort from within
Windows, you may receive the following error message:

   Caution: Fastopen is installed. Because Fastopen keeps information about
   directories including the location of directory entries, Directory Sort will
   not work when Fastopen is in use.

If you run Directory Sort from MS-DOS, outside of Windows, the program runs
normally.

CAUSE
=====

Norton's Directory Sort is giving an incorrect error message. The error message
should say that you cannot run this program from within a multitasking
environment because the low-level disk access that Directory Sort performs may
cause data corruption if another application attempts to access the disk at the
same time.

WORKAROUND
==========

Run Norton's Directory Sort from outside the Windows environment.


In addition to Directory Sort, Norton technical support recommends that the
following programs should not be run from within Microsoft Windows 3.1:

 - Speed Disk

 - Calibrate

 - Erase Protect

 - Directory Sort

 - Unerase
