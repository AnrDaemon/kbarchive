SUMMARY
=======

BttnCur.exe contains information about using buttons and cursors in the
Microsoft Windows graphical environment. BttnCur.zip contains the source code to
a dynamic- link library (DLL) that contains 15 new standard cursors and 9
standard command images to use as buttons on an application's toolbar. Other
code in the DLL draws a button using one of these images (or another image
provided by an application) in one of six different states. With this code, an
application can provide only one image for a button and dynamically create other
states at run time. This dramatically reduces the storage required for an
application to provide a button-rich graphical interface.
