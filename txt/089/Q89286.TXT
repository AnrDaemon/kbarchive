SUMMARY
=======

When running an MS-DOS 3270 or 5250 emulation package under Windows 3.0 in real
or standard mode, or Windows 3.1 in standard mode, you cannot switch away from
the emulator back to Windows without losing connection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most emulator packages that allow a workstation to connect to mini and mainframe
computers expect to have constant communication or they timeout. MS-DOS-based
applications in real and standard mode run exclusive. This means they do not
function when you switch away from them.

Some companies have written terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs that their
3270 packages to be switched away from without losing connection. Contact your
vendor to see if the package you are using supports this functionality.

This problem does not occur in 386 enhanced mode because MS-DOS-based
applications can be set by using its PIF to operate in the background.
