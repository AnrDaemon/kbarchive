======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When performing an upgrade installation of Windows 3.1, Setup rebuilds the Main,
Accessories, and Games program groups with defaults. In addition, PIF files for
MS-DOS-based applications that are found when you run Express Setup or Custom
Setup, and then select Setup Applications, are overwritten with defaults.

NOTE: The Startup group will not be modified.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Main, Games, and Accessories groups are returned to their default
configuration when you upgrade to Windows 3.1. If you have customized these
groups by deleting icons from them, those icons will be restored during setup.
If you have added additional icons to the groups, these icons will not be
deleted. Additional groups that you or other applications have set up will not
be affected.

In addition, any program information files (PIFs) that you created should be
backed up to ensure that they are not overwritten by a default PIF for the
application.

WORKAROUND
==========

Back up all the .GRP and PIF files before upgrading. These files are set up by
default in the WINDOWS directory. After the upgrade is complete, restore them to
the WINDOWS directory.

If you are upgrading to Windows for Workgroups and want to preserve these default
groups, be aware that the above workaround removes the following icons from
their respective groups:

 - Main Group

   Clipbook Viewer
   Mail
   Schedule+

 - Accessories Group

   Chat
   WinMeter
   NetWatcher

 - Games Group

   Hearts
