SUMMARY
=======

When using Windows on Banyan VINES network version 4.0, you cannot drag and drop
a file in File Manager into a directory. The following message occurs:

   Error Copying/Moving File
   Cannot replace <drive>:\<directory>: Access Denied

where <drive> and <directory> are the drive and directory into which
you are trying to drag and drop the file.

Note: This behavior also occurs when using the keyboard to copy or move a file if
you do not give the full path name AND filename in the To box of the Move or
Copy dialog box.

This problem is corrected by version 4.1 of Banyan VINES or Banyan VINES 4.1 path
5 and in Windows 3.1

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem use the keyboard to copy or move the file, and give
the full path name AND filename in the To box.

NOTE: This will only work for individual files and not groups of files.
