SUMMARY
=======

Ami Pro has confirmed that after installing the "Working model" of Ami Pro 2.0
under Windows 3.1, general protection (GP) faults may occur when you restart
Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs because the following four files are copied by the Ami Pro
installation program into the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory:

 - SHELL.DLL

 - OLECLI.DLL

 - OLESVR.DLL

 - COMMDLG.DLL

To correct the problem, expand the four files from the Windows 3.1 disks into the
Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

Disk locations are as follows:

                  Disk Size
Filename     1.44MB  1.2MB  720K
---------------------------------

SHELL.DL_      4       5       8
OLECLI.DL_     5       4       A
OLESVR.DL_     4       5       8
