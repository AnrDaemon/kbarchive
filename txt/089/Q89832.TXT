SUMMARY
=======

When Clipboard files (*.CLP) are saved, they are dependent on the number of
colors the video driver can support. Files that are saved with Clipboard using
Windows 3.1 open correctly only if the video driver being used supports the same
number of colors as it did when the files were saved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Clipboard files can be created by choosing Save from the File menu in Microsoft
Windows Clipboard. If you are using a 16-color video driver and save a .CLP
file, it will open correctly, only on a system with a video driver that supports
16 colors. The video driver resolution (640 x 480, 800 x 600, 1024 x 768) does
not matter. Clipboard files created using a video driver that supports a greater
number of colors, such as 256, only opens on a system that supports that same
number of colors.

If you attempt to open a .CLP file that was saved with more colors than the
current video driver supports, the image may not appear. Attempting to paste the
invisible image to another application may result in corrupted input.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Change the video driver to support the same number of colors as the .CLP
   file.

   -or-

 - Use another application to transfer the data, such as Paintbrush, which uses
   bitmap (.BMP) format, or Notepad, which uses text (.TXT) format.
