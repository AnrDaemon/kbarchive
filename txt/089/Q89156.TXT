The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to write to a file, the action fails and a "File Access Denied"
(error 1705) error message is displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

The steps you must use to resolve this problem depends on the network product
you are using.

For a LANtastic network, do the following:

1. Check the files and locks on the SHARE command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The
   following are the recommended settings:

         share /f:5120 /l:500

2. Verify that the .EXE, .RSC, and .OVL files are marked as read- only. If
   necessary, change the security using the MS-DOS ATTRIB command (for example,
   ATTRIB +R <filename>).

3. Ensure that the CONFIG.FP file on the server redirects the OVERLAY= to a
   directory other than the directory containing the FOXPRO.EXE file.

For a Novell network, do the following:

1. Check the user's privileges.

2. Have the user log in as a supervisor and repeat the operation.

3. Ensure that the .EXE, .ESO and .ESL files are marked as read-only. If
   necessary, change the security using the MS-DOS ATTRIB command (ATTRIB +R
   <filename>).

LANtastic is manufactured by Artisoft, Inc. and Novell products by Novell, Inc.,
both vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
