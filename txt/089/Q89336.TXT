TITLE   :"Write Protected Disk" Errors in WinLogin SETUP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error messages occur at the end of the WinLogin setup process if
you install a WinLogin database from the WinLogin 1.0 master disks

   System Error
   Write-protected disk in drive X:

   -and-

   Unable to write new INF file 'X:\stfsetup.in_'.

where X: is the floppy drive containing the master disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After successfully completing the setup process, the WinLogin Setup program
writes the location of the newly installed database to the STFSETUP.IN_ file on
the master disk, so it can use this as the default database location during
reinstalls. The above error messages occur because the WinLogin master disk is
write-protected. The only side effect of this error is that the newly installed
database location will not be the default database location if you reinstall
WinLogin. This error has no effect on the installed copy of WinLogin.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, install WinLogin from a backup copy of the master disk,
and do not write-protect the backup copy until you finish running the WinLogin
Setup program. An alternative is to copy all of the files from the master disk
to a network drive, and write-protect all these files except STFSETUP.IN_.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
