======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows in standard mode on a network, you may receive the
following message when trying to switch between applications:

   Fatal Error - Cannot Swap Windows

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when multiple machines use the same directory for Windows
temporary files. Because Windows uses standard filenames when it creates swap
files, more than one swap file can have the same name and intermittent errors
can occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, set the TEMP environment variable to a directory on the
local hard drive. If you are using a diskless workstation, set the TEMP variable
to a unique directory for each machine.
