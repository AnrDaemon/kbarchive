-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The LPTx-options line is added to the [Network] section of the WIN.INI file when
a permanent printer connection to a Novell NetWare print queue is established.
The information written in the WIN.INI file is relevant to the Novell CAPTURE
command and PRINTCON utility. For example:

        LPT3-options=200,1,8,0,0,LST;JohnD

MORE INFORMATION
================

The meaning of each value is as follows:

   Value           Definition
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

   LPTx-options=   LPTx-options, where x is the port number used
   200,            Notification of spooled print job
   1,              Number of copies for a print job
   8,              Inserts left hand tab of specified size (default 8)
   0,              Enable time outs (time in seconds job is held in
                      queue)
   0,              Form name (a predefined form set up by PRINTCON)
   LST;            Banner text (cover page for each print job)
   JohnD           Banner name (user)

For every LPT port that is permanently attached to a print queue, there is a
corresponding LPTx-options setting present in the [Network] section of the
WIN.INI file. (You can modify this setting with the Networks application in
Windows Control Panel.)
