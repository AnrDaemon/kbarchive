SUMMARY
=======

The Novell NetWare protocol IPX is not listed in the Available Protocols dialog
box in the Network options in Control Panel when you choose the Adapters button
and then choose the Setup button.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because Novell NetWare is the only network that uses the IPX protocol, Windows
for Workgroups does not allow IPX to be added as a standalone protocol. IPX must
be added by installing Novell NetWare Connectivity through Windows for
Workgroups. To add Novell NetWare Connectivity take the following steps:

1. From the Main group, start Control Panel.

2. Choose the Network icon.

3. Choose the Networks button.

4. Novell NetWare should appear on the left in the Available Network Types list.
   Select Novell NetWare and choose the Add button, then choose the OK button.

This also adds the Novell NetWare button to File Manager and Print Manager. If
IPX were added alone, the NetWare button(s) would not be present in File Manager
or Print Manager, and thus not be possible to map drives or capture printers
from within Windows for Workgroups for the Novell file servers in use.

IPX is a proprietary Novell NetWare protocol. The Windows for Workgroups
implementation of IPX is in two parts: MSIPX.SYS and MSIPX.COM. These two files
replace the single Novell NetWare file IPX.COM.
