======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To unload the real mode redirector, log off from workgroup services, and
disconnect from the currently connected servers, type the following at the
MS-DOS command prompt:

   net stop /y

The /Y switch allows you to perform the above functions without having to provide
any input.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To connect to available network servers from MS-DOS and load the workgroup
software for MS-DOS (real mode redirector), type ONE of the following at the
MS-DOS command prompt:

 - net start workstation

 - net start basic

 - net start full

VSERVER.386 is the server VxD. A computer can still be a server after executing
the NET START WORKSTATION command in 386 enhanced mode, but it cannot be a
browse master. Browse service requires the virtual redirector (VREDIR.386) to
load the browse service (VBROWSE.386).

Typing "net stop" (without the quotation marks) unloads the real-mode redirector
and the following prompts appear:

   You are currently logged on as <user name>
   Do you want to log off? (Y/N)[N]:

If you have existing connections and you respond "Y," the following message
appears:

   Continuing will cancel these connections:
   "device=\\server\share"

   Do you want to continue this operation? (Y/N)[N]:

If you respond "Y," the following displays:

   <user name> was logged off successfully.
   Command completed successfully.

If you type "net stop /y" (without the quotation marks), the above two prompts
default to a response of "Y" and you are not required to respond.
