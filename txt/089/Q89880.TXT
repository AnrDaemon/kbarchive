TITLE   :Toolbar Buttons Extend Beyond the Toolbar in File Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you customize the toolbar in File Manager, some buttons may extend to the
right beyond the edge of the File Manager window and become inaccessible.

CAUSE
=====

This most often occurs if you use Windows for Workgroups at lower video
resolutions. At lower resolutions you may not be able to use all of the icons
available for the toolbar because they extend into an inaccessible area of File
Manager.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1 and 3.11 QWIII.DRV. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no workaround for this problem. You can avoid the problem by maximizing
File Manager to determine the maximum number of toolbar icons that you can have.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Install the VGA driver that is provided with Windows for Workgroups.

2. From the Main group, start File Manager.

3. From the Options menu, choose Customize Toolbar.

4. Choose the first button in the Available Buttons list, then choose the Add
   button.

5. Continue with step 4 until the Available Buttons list is empty, then choose
   the Close button.

6. Maximize File Manager and note that all the toolbar icons cannot be accessed.
