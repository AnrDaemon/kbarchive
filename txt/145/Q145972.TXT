TITLE   :XCLN: Cannot Move Messages by Moving Group Header
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the messages in the Microsoft Exchange Inbox are grouped by Subject, the
group headers cannot be dragged and dropped into any other folder. In addition,
right clicking on the group header will not bring up the shortcut menu.

WORKAROUND
==========

To move these messages, you can expand the group header to display the actual
messages and then move the messages rather than the group header.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of the Microsoft
Exchange Clients for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
