appearance, regardless of the value of the Appearance property.

This problem does not occur in Visual Basic, 16-bit, version 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no known workaround.

STATUS
======

This is a Windows 32-bit limitation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a ComboBox control, Combo1, of any style, to Form1.

3. Set the Appearance property of Combo1 to "0 - Flat". In design and run mode,
   the appearance of the control remains 3-D.
