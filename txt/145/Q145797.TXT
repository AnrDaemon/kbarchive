TITLE   :No User Account Authentication Appears in Internet Explorer
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you set up the Internet Information Server 1.0 FTP server and try to
connect to the server using Internet Explorer, a Windows NT user account
authentication dialog box does not appear. Instead, the following error message
appears:

   The attempt to load 'ftp://<ftpservername>' failed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you clear the Allow Anonymous Connection check box for
the FTP server in Internet Information Server and disable the Internet Guest
account.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, enter the user account information in the following
format:

   ftp://<user name>:<password>@<ftpservername>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 1.0 and Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 1.5 and 2.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Then the Allow Anonymous Connection check box is cleared, Windows NT passwords
are sent to the server without encryption. Therefore, users are required to
enter valid Windows NT user names and passwords to log onto the FTP service.
This check box is checked by default for security reasons.
