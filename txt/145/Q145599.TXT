PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Xircom Netaccess Multiport modem in Windows NT, you may
have problems installing other network software or components (for example:
TCP/IP or related components, such as DHCP or WINS) that require protocol
binding with your network adapter.

CAUSE
=====

The Xircom Netaccess Multiport modem card provides multiple modem access that
you can use with the Remote Access Service (RAS). This card is not a network
adapter, but it appears as a network adapter when you network bindings in
Control Panel Network.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Xircom Netaccess Multiport modem adapter is not on Windows NT Hardware
Compatibility List (HCL). Microsoft does not support this adapter or the driver
provided by the manufacturer.

To work around this problem:

1. In Control Panel Network, click Bindings.

2. In the "Show Bindings for" list, select the Xircom Netaccess adapter.

3. Select the protocol that is bound with the Xircom Netaccess Multiport modem
   and click Disable. Do not disable the binding with Ndis-Wan.

4. Click OK and quit Network Settings.

5. Shut down and restart Windows NT.
