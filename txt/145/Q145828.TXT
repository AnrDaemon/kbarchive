The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

On your computer running Windows NT and the File and Print Services for NetWare
(FPNW) service, the following event appears in the security event log:

   Event ID: 537
   Description:
   unexpected error occurred during logon.

CAUSE
=====

There is a Windows NT server with the same name as the Windows NT FPNW server
service name on your network. This FPNW service name must be different than the
regular Windows NT server name.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the FPNW Server Name field, type a new name that is unique on your network.
The new name does not take effect until you stop and restart the FPNW service.

The FPNW Server Name is the name that NetWare client computers use to refer to
the server.
