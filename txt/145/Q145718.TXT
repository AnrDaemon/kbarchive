TITLE   :PC Gen: Err Msg: Error Copying... when Running MMFCLEAN.EXE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the MMFClean utility, MMFCLEAN.EXE, is used against a mail message file
(.MMF) with a hexadecimal identifier (hex-id) of more than three significant
digits, MMFCLEAN.EXE will not affect the file.

You may also get an error message in the MMFCLEAN.LOG file:

   Error copying <drive>:\MAILDATA\MMF\<hex-id>.MMF

where "drive" is the drive the postoffice is mapped to, and the "hex-id" is for
the .MMF file that could not be cleaned.

CAUSE
=====

MMFCLEAN.EXE will only effectively operate on the three digits left of the
decimal point. For example, the MMFCLEAN.LOG indicates the following error when
executed against MMF filename 00001234.MMF:

   User1 00000234
   Error copying M:\MMF\00000234.MMF to M:\MMF\~~MMFCCN.TMP

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been resolved in version 3.5.4096 of MMFCLEAN.EXE. Please
contact Microsoft Product Support Services in order to obtain the latest
revision of MMFCLEAN.EXE.
