TITLE   :XCLN: Boldon James MAPI X.500 Address Book Client Service Crash
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You are using the Boldon James MAPI X.500 Address Book client service on a
computer that is also running Microsoft Exchange Server. When you attempt to
save configuration changes, the Inbox or the Outlook client stops responding. An
access violation message similar to the following appears:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated EXCHNGE32.EXE
   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x6de3e107

This will not happen if the Inbox client or the Outlook client software is
installed on a computer other than the one running Microsoft Exchange Server.

CAUSE
=====

When installed on the same computer as Microsoft Exchange Server, the client
Setup.exe will not overwrite the existing Wmsui[32].Dll files. This is proper
behavior.

However, the DBCS-enabled code in the server's Wmsui that displays property sheet
dialogs (for address book and configuration) would access violate on close.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 5.0
Server U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query
on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
