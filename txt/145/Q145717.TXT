SUMMARY
=======

Information in the Windows NT Resource Kit regarding the LPD service is
incorrect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Windows NT Resource Guide, volume 2, page 357, it states under the "To
Start or Stop the LPDSVC Service" heading:

   Double-click the Services option in Control Panel, select Lpdsvc, and then
   choose the Start button.

   This is not correct. Instead, it should say:

   Double-click the Services option in Control Panel, select TCP/IP Print Server,
   and then choose the Start button.
