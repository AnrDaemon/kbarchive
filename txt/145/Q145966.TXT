TITLE   :XCLN: Personal Views Lost When Changing Stores
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the store to which new mail is delivered, user-defined views
seem to be lost.

MORE INFORMATION
================

User-defined views are stored in the IPM_COMMON_VIEWS folder of the default
store. If the store is changed, personal views will be lost unless the user
copies them to the new store. The user can do this by selecting the "Copy Design
of Forms & Views" checkbox available under the Tools, Application Design,
Copy Folder Design menu. They will want to copy the views from the root folder
of that store to the root folder of the new default store.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: view store personal
