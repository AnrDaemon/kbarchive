SYMPTOMS
========

The WIDTH # statement is used to assign an output-line width to a file opened
using the Open statement. However, the sample code given in the Visual Basic
Help file does not work in a form.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem is that Visual Basic interprets the "Width" statement as a property
of the Form when the code is run from a Form module. When run from a Code module
or a Class module, the statement functions as documented because there is no
default object on which to apply the Width property. Visual Basic 4.0 can be
forced to use the correct Width statement in this case by specifying the call
using "Typelib.Method" syntax. The Width statement is actually a "Visual Basic
for Applications" (VBA) method, so the following syntax must be used:

      VBA.Width filenum, width

      Private Sub Command1_Click()

         Open "TESTFILE" For Output As #1
         VBA.Width 1, 5 ' Note:  "#" symbol omitted
         For I = 0 To 9
            Print #1, Chr(48 + I);
         Next I
         Close #1

      End Sub

NOTE: The compiler will not accept this statement unless the "#" symbol is
removed.

Steps to Reproduce
------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default. Place the
   following code in Form1's Form_Click Event.

         Private Sub Form_Click()
           Open "TESTFILE" For Output As #1  ' Open file for output.
           Width #1, 5 ' Set output-line width to 5.
           For I = 0 To 9  ' Loop 10 times.
               Print #1, Chr(48 + I); ' Prints 5 characters per line.
           Next I
           Close #1    ' Close file.
         End Sub

2. Run the program and then click the form. An "Invalid use of property" error
   is generated.
