TITLE   :XFOR: cc:Mail Messages Are Not Delivered by DEC Mail Bus
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Messages that originate from cc:Mail and pass through an X.400 connector to DEC
Mail Bus may end up in the BAD Mail Directory on the DEC Mail Bus system. The
message will not be delivered to the final recipient, and a non- delivery-report
(NDR) is not sent back to the originator of the message.

CAUSE
=====

The cc:Mail Connector is incorrectly setting the MAPI property
PR_RECIPIENT_NUMBER to -1, which the store then maps to the corresponding XAPI
attribute for Recipient Number.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DEC Mail Bus system will report the following error as a reason for the
failure:

   <OriginallySpecifiedRecipientNo>
   ERROR: ASN.1 Encoding Error, Integer Value Exceeds 32 bits

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 5.0
Server U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query
