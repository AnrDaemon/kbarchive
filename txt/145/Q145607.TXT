KEYWORDS:kbtool kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual FoxPro allows you to Customize the different toolbars that come with the
product. The Help for the Customize Toolbar dialog box states, "To add the
button, drag it to the desired toolbar." When you try this with the Forms
Controls Toolbar, it creates a new toolbar with the button that you tried to add
to the Forms Control Toolbar instead of adding it on to the Form Controls
toolbar.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. On the View menu, click ToolBars

2. In the Toolbars dialog box, select the Form Controls check box, and then
   click the Customize button.

3. From the Customize Toolbar dialog box, drag the Run button to the Form
   Controls Toolbar.

Instead of adding it to the Form Controls Toolbar, Visual FoxPro creates a new
toolbar with the Run button on it. If you repeat the steps using the Report
Controls Toolbar, Visual FoxPro adds the button to the Report Controls Toolbar
as expected.
