SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Compose New Fax Wizard to send a fax, you cannot specify the
font that is used when the fax is sent. The system font that Windows 95 uses to
display text in menus, title bars, and dialog boxes is always used when a fax is
sent, even if you specify that a different font should be used when sending mail
with Microsoft Exchange.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can specify the font that you want Microsoft Exchange to use when sending
mail by clicking Options on the Tools menu in Microsoft Exchange, clicking the
Send tab, and then clicking Font. The font you specify is used by default when
you compose a new message in Microsoft Exchange, but not when you run the
Compose New Fax Wizard from the Start menu or from Microsoft Exchange.

To start the Compose New Fax Wizard from the Start menu, click the Start button,
point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to Fax, and then click Compose
New Fax. To start the Compose New Fax Wizard from Microsoft Exchange, click New
Fax on the Compose menu.

To specify the font that you want Microsoft Exchange to use when sending a fax,
you must compose the fax using the New Message command on the Compose menu
instead of the New Fax command. To change the font when you are composing a new
message, click Font on the Format menu.

If you have sent a fax to the recipient previously, you can select that recipient
from your personal address book by clicking Address Book on the Tools menu, and
then clicking Personal Address Book in the Show Names From The box.

If you have not sent a fax to the recipient previously, you must specify the
recipient's address. Use the following syntax for the address

   [fax:<nnnnnnn>]

where <nnnnnnn> is the recipient's fax number.
