TITLE   :XADM: 1993 Private Extension Support on Per-Message Envelope
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message from a DEC All-in-One mail system to a Microsoft
Exchange Server with the X.400 Connector, the message may not get to the
intended Microsoft Exchange Recipient and the original sender may not receive a
Non-Delivery Report (NDR). No errors will be recorded in the Windows NT Event
Log.

However, messages sent from Microsoft Exchange to DEC All-In-One recipients flow
fine. Additionally, messages sent from Microsoft Exchange to DEC with a read
receipt requested will successfully return the read notification back to the
Microsoft Exchange sender.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 1993 X.400 recommendation supports a per-message envelope Private Extension.
Digital Equipment's latest version of Mailbus400 MTA (v2.0) implements this
extension. Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 does not support per-message
envelope Private Extensions. Service Pack 2 (SP2) and Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0a add support for per-message envelope and report content Private
Extensions.

NOTE: Microsoft Exchange Server does not support per-recipient Private
Extensions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
