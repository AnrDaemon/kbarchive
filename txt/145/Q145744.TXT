TITLE   :PRB: Client Installed from ReadOnly Server Won't Start
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible to perform a client installation (netsetup) from a server that is
marked readonly. The installation will process normally, but once the
installation is complete, the client will not run.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the server share attributes to "FULL" and the client will start normally.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Perform a server installation of Visual SourceSafe and share the directory
   with "readonly" rights.

2. Perform a client installation on another computer from the readonly server.
   Click Ignore if any error messages appear.

3. The setup will continue normally.

4. Attempt to launch the client, and an error dialog box appears containing
   illegible text. The text looks similar to "wllowlluwllowll" and the client
   will not start.

5. Set the server share attributes to "FULL" and the client will start normally.

NOTE: This behavior occurs whenever the server share is marked as readonly.
