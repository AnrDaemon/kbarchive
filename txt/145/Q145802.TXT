SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Find By Symptom feature in Microsoft Pregnancy and Child Care,
sometimes the final result does not seem to represent an accurate answer that is
based on the information you provided.

The Find By Symptom feature is designed to ask a series of questions. These
questions help determine the possible cause of a medical symptom.

CAUSE
=====

Depending upon the question content (weight of the question), one question may
take priority, or overwhelm another in a way that does not seem intuitive to the
person asking the question.

STATUS
======

The behavior of the module reflects real life situations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, although a parent may report to their physician that the child has
had an appendectomy, the parent may be wrong. Physicians often discount
information they are told based on answers they receive to other questions.

An example of this counter-intuitive behavior is a child with abdominal pain.
When you answered questions in the Find By Symptom feature, you may have
responded that the child has had an appendectomy. However, the weight of the
other questions may still point to peritonitis (result of a ruptured, or burst
appendix). The peritonitis category would then refer you to the appendicitis
article that may seem anti-intuitive.
