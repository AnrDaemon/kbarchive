TITLE   :PRB: Resource Language Must Match the Current System Language
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbwizard kbMFC kbVC400 kbLocalization kbClassWizard kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The ClassWizard, included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under some circumstances, ClassWizard does not show the control IDs for a dialog
resource in the Control IDs listbox under Member Variable Tab.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. If the language settings of the resource are not the same as
the language settings of the operating system, you will see this behavior. For
example, if you are using US English settings for the operating system and the
dialog resource is in some other language, you will see this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

By design, the language setting for the resources must be identical to the
language setting for the operating system. There are two ways to synchronize
your resources language:

Method One: Reset the Language for an Existing Resource
-------------------------------------------------------

1. From the Resource View, highlight the resource in question, and then
   right-click it.

2. Select Properties.

3. Choose the language that matches that of your operating system.

Method Two: Copy an Existing Resource to One that Matches Your Language
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Right-click the dialog's name in Resource View, and then click Insert Copy.

2. In Insert Resource Copy window, select the language that exactly matches the
   language setting of the operating system.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Generate a dialog-based application by using MFC AppWizard.

2. Change to Resource View.

3. Open the main window dialog.

4. Add an edit control.

5. Right-click the dialog's name in Resource View, and click Properties. In the
   Dialog properties window, change Language Settings to some language other
   than the current system language.

6. Start ClassWizard.

7. Click the Member Variables tab. The ID for the edit control does not show up
   in the Control IDs list.

8. Change the Language Settings property to match the current system language.
   Now, ClassWizard will show the IDs in Member Variables tab.

For more information about using the resource editor and localizing your
application please see:

 - "Using the Resource Editors" in the Help file's "Visual C++ User's Guide," in
   the "Working with Resources" section.
