SYMPTOMS
========

When the DHCP lease of your Windows 95 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11 computer
is released and renewed, the node type and scope ID are not updated. For
example, when you release the lease, make changes to the Node Type and Scope ID
information and renew the lease with the IPCONFIG /RENEW (or WINIPCFG /RENEW for
Windows 95) command, the new lease does not include the updated Node Type and
Scope ID.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, reboot your Windows 95 or Windows for Workgroups
3.11 computer.

STATUS
======
