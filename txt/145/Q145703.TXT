TITLE   :Windows Socket Error Running Program Using IPX/SPX
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run a program that uses the IPX/SPX protocol, such as ArcServe
Backup Agent for NetWare by Cheyenne, you may receive the following error
message:

   Windows Socket error, Couldn't create socket(10047)

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if the Wsock32.dll file is missing, is damaged, or has been
replaced by a third-party protocol stack's sockets interface.

RESOLUTION
==========

Extract a new copy of the original Wsock32.dll file. To do so, follow these
steps:

1. Rename the Wsock32.dll file in the Windows\System folder to Wsock32.3rd.

2. Use the Extract tool to extract a new copy of the Wsock32.dll file from your
   original Windows 95 disks or CD-ROM to the Windows\System folder. For
   information about using the Extract tool, please see the following article in
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

A socket contains three pieces of information: an internetwork address, a
protocol, and a port number. The address information must contain a network ID
and a node ID. Because both TCP/IP and IPX/SPX have network and node information
incorporated in their addressing schemes, either protocol can use the sockets
interface. The port number combined with the protocol determines whether the
socket uses TCP, UDP, or IPX, and which service will be used.

The component files that make up the sockets interface for Windows 95 are
Winsock.dll and Wsock32.dll. The files that are included with Windows 95 support
the sockets interface for both TCP/IP and IPX/SPX. The Cheyenne ArcServe Agent
makes calls directly to Wsock32.dll to obtain an IPX socket for communication
with a NetWare server to perform backup operations over the network.

Because some third-party vendors may require functionality from the sockets
interface for their proprietary protocol stacks, they may replace the component
files that make up the sockets interface with their own proprietary versions of
these files. If the third-party vendor's sockets interface does not support
sockets using IPX/SPX, any program that uses the sockets interface to
communicate using IPX/SPX may generate an error message.
