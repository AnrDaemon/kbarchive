-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can run both Remote Access Server (RAS) and the Multitasking MTA for Windows
NT (NT MMTA) from the same Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51 server, using
asynchronous communication, RAS for network connections, and the NT MMTA for
Mail delivery.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you configure a Windows NT version 3.51 Server as a RAS server, the COM
ports that the RAS server will be using are configured through Networks under
the Control Panel.

The COM ports that the NT MMTA will be using are set, during the configuration,
by the AsyncCommPort parameter of the EXTERNAL.INI file. The /AsyncCommPort
parameter will be read by the MMTA application when it runs as a service or from
the CDM line. For example,

EXTERNAL.INI
------------

   [External - Async1]
   AsyncCommPort=Com2

Command line
------------

   EXTERNAL -Dm /AsyncCommPort=Com2

Notes:

 - Additional EXTERNAL.INI parameters and External command line options are
   required. Refer to Appendix A "External Program Options" in the Multitasking
   MTA for Windows NT "Administrator's Guide" for more information.

 - The RAS server and the NT MMTA can not specify the same COM ports. For
   example, if you are using RAS on COM1, you would specify COM2 for the NT
   MMTA.


When the NTMMTA starts as a service or as an application from the CMD line, both
of its instances (Services) will start, and data will be transfered. The
starting of the services occures regardless of being set up as automatic or
manual startup, or the order of the services.
