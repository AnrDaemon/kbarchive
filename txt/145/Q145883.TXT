======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Expndsym.cmd file is only available on the following CDs:

 - Simplified Chinese Windows NT Server 4.0

 - Traditional Chinese Windows NT Server 4.0

 - Korean Windows NT Server 4.0

MORE INFORMATION
================

The purpose of Expndsym.cmd is to expand the compressed debug symbol files to
the Winnt\System32 directory. In the Windows NT traditional Chinese, simplified
Chinese, and Korean compact disks, only server PPC debug symbol files are
compressed. Windows NT Workstation CDs do not have compressed symbol files,
thus, they do not need Expndsym.cmd. The U.S. version of Windows NT Workstation
and Windows NT Server CDs have all symbol files compressed, and Expndsym.cmd is
on both CDs.

The software development kit (SDK) Setup file copies debug symbols from retail
CDs to the hard disk drive. The SDK Setup file is able to expand and copy. If
you do not have the SDK, you can copy the files manually.

Additional query words: debug symbol
