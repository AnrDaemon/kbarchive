TITLE   :Quick Viewer Blank When You Remote Control to Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.1 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade your Systems Management Server 1.1 client computers to Service
Pack 1 and use Remote Control to access the client, the fonts are displayed
incorrectly. They are spaced out and cannot be read. In addition, the Systems
Management Server Quick View windows is blank.


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the remote control client uses a higher pixel or color
depth resolution than the Systems Management Server.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, install the IDIS_LM.DLL file from the System
Management Server 1.1 compact disc (not Service Pack 1).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. A fix to this problem is in development, but has not been
regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft
does not recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information on the availability of this fix.
