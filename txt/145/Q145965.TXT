-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you transfer messages remotely via Remote Access Services (RAS), all the
processor time is used while the transfer of the messages is occurring.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design. For performance reasons the 16-bit client uses all the
processor time during transfers.
