======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article gives you the information you will need to modify the SWDEPEND.INI
file so that Visual Basic's Setup Wizard generates a Setup program that
correctly installs your control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Create a section in the SWDEPEND.INI file. The section's name should be the
filename of your control, including the OCX extension. For example, for OLE
controls created using Microsoft Foundation Classes version 3.0, the new section
would look like this:

      [MYCTRL.OCX]
      Register=$(DLLSelfRegister)
      Dest=$(WinSysPath)
      Uses1=MFC30.DLL
      Uses2=OC30.DLL
      ...

The complete list of files that you need to list as dependencies will depend on
the options you used to build the control. Second example: For OLE Controls
created using Microsoft Foundation Classes version 4.0, the new section would
look like this:

      [MYCTRL.OCX]
      Register=$(DLLSelfRegister)
      Dest=$(WinSysPath)
      Uses1=OCX Runtime Support

REFERENCES
==========

Complete information on the syntax of the SWDEPEND.INI file can be found in the
Visual Basic online help file. From the Contents tab of the help file, Click
"Read Me," then "Setup Toolkit and SetupWizard," then "SetupWizard Dependency
File Notes for Microsoft Visual Basic."
