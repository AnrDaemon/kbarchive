OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After using the Slider control's ClearSel method, the SelStart property is set
to -1. According to the Visual Basic documentation and to the Online Help, the
SelStart property should be identical to the Value property after using the
ClearSel method.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Start Visual Basic.

2. Start a new project. Form1 is created by default.

3. Add a Slider control to Form1.

   Note: With Visual Basic Versions 5.0 and later, you must first reference the
   Microsoft Windows Common Controls library.

4. Change the SelectRange property of Slider1 to True.

5. From the Run menu, choose Start (ALT, R, S) or press F5 to start the
   application. Immediately press CTRL+BREAK, select Break from the Run menu, or
   press the Pause button on the toolbar to pause execution.

6. The following lines of code will select a range in the Slider control. Type
   them on separate lines in the Debug window.

         Slider1.SelStart = 2
         Slider1.SelLength = 3

7. After visually verifying that the correct range is selected in the slider
   control, invoke the slider's ClearSel method by typing the following in the
   Debug window:

         Slider1.ClearSel

8. Examine the SelStart property of the slider by typing

         Print Slider1.SelStart

   in the Debug window.

   According to the documentation, this should return a 0, because the Value
   property of the slider is 0 by default and has not been changed. However, it
   instead returns a value of -1.
