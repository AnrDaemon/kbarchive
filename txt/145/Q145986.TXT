MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs when the Exchange MTA receives a message from a foreign MTA
that has an illegally formed X400 address containing a country code with a
single character. All X400 country codes must be either two or three characters
long.

The MTA hangs when it attempts to perform content conversion on the message
containing the invalid address. The Microsoft Exchange version 4.0 SP1, SP2,
SP3, and SP4 MTA will not log content conversion failures to the BF0.LOG files
if APDU logging is enabled. However, the Microsoft Exchange version 5.0 MTA will
log content conversion errors to the BF0.LOG files if APDU logging has been
enabled. This functionality has also been added for all 4.0 MTAs starting with
build 996.18 which is a post SP4 build. This feature is extremely desirable
since it allows messages that fail content conversion to be logged to the APDU
logs in order to determine the cause of the failure. APDU logging is enabled by
setting APDU logging to maximum and X.400 Service logging to minimum.
