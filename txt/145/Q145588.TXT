TITLE   :SMS Client Group and Icons Not Created for RAS Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you execute the Systems Management Server (SMS) Client Setup from a Windows
for Workgroups or Windows 95 client via Remote Access Service (RAS), the SMS
Client Group and Icons are not created.

CAUSE
=====

After the first phase of Client Setup completes, you are instructed to restart
the system to allow changes to take affect. Since Windows for Workgroups and
Windows 95 RAS clients do not have a network connection when they are started,
the SMSRUN16.EXE file, called from the load= line in the WIN.INI, does not
execute properly. The SMS Client Group and Icons are not created. This also
prevents any autostart components such as PGC and PCM from starting at bootup.

WORKAROUND
==========

After the system has started, make a RAS connection to your network and the
manually execute SMSRUN16.EXE located in the \MS\SMS\BIN directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
