TITLE   :XCLN: Search Items Don't Match Criteria
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Find feature to locate a piece of mail, the search results may
not seem to reflect the syntax of the query.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS,
Windows 3.x, Windows 95, and Windows NT clients. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On the Tools menu there is a Find option that can be used to locate data in the
user's mailbox. Under the Find option, users can choose an Advanced button to
perform a more specific search for needed information. One of the options here
is the choice "Only items that do no match these conditions."

Under normal circumstances, this would cause the search engine to locate data
that does not match the search criteria on the first query page. However, it
also has the effect of negating all the query data on the Advanced page.

For example, there is a choice on the Advanced search page to search for Only
Unread Items. If the user chooses this option and THEN chooses the option to
also search for items that DO NOT match these conditions, the net effect is to
search for items that are already read by the user.
