TITLE   :XCON: GWART Is Incorrect Due to Latency in Directory Replication
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible that during directory replication the Gateway Address Routing
Table (GWART) will be created incorrectly, reflecting incorrect routes. Once
directory replication has completed, the GWARTs will be correct. If the
Microsoft Exchange Server system is large and there is a high likelihood of
latency in the directory replication updates, there it is likely that the GWART
will be incorrect for a number of days. While the GWART is incorrect, it will be
possible for messages to be routed incorrectly, leading eventually to NDRs.

STATUS
======

version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
