SYMPTOMS
========

When you open FrontPage Explorer and click the List Webs button in the Open Webs
dialog box or create a new Web, you get an HTTP 400 error message.

CAUSE
=====

This error indicates insufficient memory due to one or more of the following:

 - Not enough physical Random Access Memory (RAM).
 - Insufficient free space on your hard disk drive.
 - Not enough virtual memory.
 - Invalid or no Temp directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this error, do the following:

1. Make sure that you have at least 16 megabytes (MB) of physical RAM installed
   on your computer if you are running the Personal Web Server, FrontPage
   Explorer, and FrontPage Editor at the same time. If you are not running the
   Personal Web Server, but you are running FrontPage Explorer and FrontPage
   Editor, make sure your computer has at least 8 MB of physical RAM.

2. Verify that you have at least 16 MB of free space on the hard disk.

3. Make sure that you have a permanent swap file that is at least 20 MB.

4. Check that there is a valid SET TEMP statement in the Autoexec.bat file. Also
   make sure that the Temp directory exists and is not full of temporary files.
   Microsoft recommends that you delete these temporary files after you exit
   Windows.
