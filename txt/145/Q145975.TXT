TITLE   :XADM: Knowledge of Other Servers in Site Not Instantaneous
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When two or more servers are simultaneously added to a site, Reps-To and
Reps-From information may not be complete in all servers until after the
knowledge consistency checker (KCC) runs at least once.

This is because the initial setup does not make all the replica links. This
functionality is intended by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Reps-To and Reps-from are object attributes for the site that tell a particular
server about the presence of other servers in the site with which they need to
exchange information.

The KCC needs to run once or more depending on the number of servers installed on
the site. The amount of KCC runs needed for all servers on the site to have
knowledge of all other servers depends on the number of servers in the site.
