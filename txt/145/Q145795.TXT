SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange Windows clients, the "When selecting, automatically select
entire word" option does not always work. It will not select the entire word
when you select the last character of a word that is followed by a punctuation
mark or hard return

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0
Windows, Windows NT, and Windows 95 clients. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
