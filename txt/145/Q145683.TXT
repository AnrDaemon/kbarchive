TITLE   :BUG: Changing ListItem.Selected Doesn't Change SelectedItem
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:4.00 | 4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Setting the Selected property of a ListItem object in a ListView control to True
does not change the SelectedItem property of the ListView control to correspond
to this ListItem.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, use the SelectedItem property of the ListView control
instead of the Selected property of an individual ListItem. Setting the
SelectedItem property of a ListView control to a given ListItem will correctly
modify the Selected property of that ListItem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce
------------------

1. Start Visual Basic, or if it is already running, choose New Project from the
   File menu.

2. Add a single ListView control to Form1.

3. Add the following code to Form1:

      Option Explicit

      Private Sub Form_Load()
          Dim LI As ListItem
          Dim i As Integer

          For i = 1 To 3
              Set LI = listview1.ListItems.Add(, , "Test " & i)
              LI.Selected = True
          Next i

          Debug.Print "SelectedItem = " & listview1.SelectedItem.Text

          For i = 1 To 3
              Debug.Print listview1.ListItems(i).Text & ", Selected = " _
              & listview1.ListItems(i).Selected
          Next i
      End Sub

4. Press F5 to run the project. Notice the output in the debug window:

   SelectedItem = Test 1
   Test 1, Selected = False
   Test 2, Selected = False
   Test 3, Selected = True

   Although the Selected property of each ListItem is correct, the SelectedItem
   property of the ListView control itself still refers to the first ListItem.
   Setting the Selected property of the ListItems did not modify the
   SelectedItem property of the ListView control. To work around the problem,
   set the SelectedItem property instead. For example, in this sample, change
   the Selected line inside the first For..Next loop from

         LI.Selected = True

   to:

         Set ListView1.SelectedItem = LI

   Running the project after this change has been made will cause the expected
   output (that is, the Text property of SelectedItem is now 'Test 3') to be
   displayed in the debug window.
