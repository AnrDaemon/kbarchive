TITLE   :XADM: Migrated MS Mail 3.x X400 PAB Entries NDR w/ Bad Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to send mail to a recipient in your Personal Address Book (PAB),
and this PAB entry was migrated from a version 3.x Microsoft Mail for Windows
mail message file (.mmf), you may get the following undeliverable message from
the System Administrator:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   Subject:msgsubject
   Sent:1/1/80 4:05:41PM

   The following recipients could not be reached:
   Migrated Ms Mail User (X400)' on 1/1/80 4:05:42PM
   The message was undelivered because the specified recipient postal address was
   incorrectMSEXCH:MSExchangeIS:sitename:SERVERNAME

CAUSE
=====

During the migration process of a .mmf file (either through the Migration Wizard
or Import menu option), the existing PAB entries are created in a Microsoft
Exchange Personal Address Book. With a Microsoft Mail X400 type PAB entry, all
of the fields in the recipients OR address are migrated regardless of whether
they contain data. For example, if a user created a X400 PAB entry in Microsoft
Mail using the X400 fields template as follows:

   Alias: User1
   Country Code: US
   Administration Domain Name:  (one space)
   Private Domain Name: MICROSOFT
   Personal Name: Surname: user1
   Given Name:
   Initials:
   Organization Name: SiteName
   Organizational Unit Names (OU):
   Organizational Unit Names (OU):
   Domain attribute type:
   value:
   Domain attribute type:
   value:
   Comment:

When the above is migrated into a Microsoft Exchange PAB, and a message is
addressed to this user, the address formed for the recipient will be as
follows:

   c=US;ADMD=;PRMD=MICROSOFT;S=User1;G=;I=;O=SiteName;OU=;OU=;DDA.TYPE=;
   DDA.VALUE=;DA.TY PE=;DDA.VALUE=

Even though the fields (G, I, and OU) had no value (ADMD contains a single space
and is valid) in the Microsoft Mail PAB entry, they were still migrated into the
newly formed address in Microsoft Exchange. Blank entries are invalid for X400
fields; therefore, the Message Transfer Agent rejects the message and the
Information Store returns it to the sender.

RESOLUTION
==========

The migration utilities were updated to parse out any blank or null fields that
exist in a Microsoft Mail X400 PAB entry. By parsing out these blank fields, a
valid X400 address is formed in the Microsoft Exchange PAB and messages will no
longer NDR. The same address as above will look as follows after you apply the
fix:

   C=US;ADMD= ;PRMD=MICROSOFT;S=User1;O=SiteName.

NOTE: The fix needs to be applied before you migrate the .mmf file.

STATUS
======

version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
