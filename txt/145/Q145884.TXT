TITLE   :FindFirstFile Returns Error "The Network Name Was Deleted"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork kbProgramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you programmatically add a share (NetShareAdd) and directly after this run
FindFirstFile on the directory just shared, the following error is returned:

   The network name was deleted.

This only happens if the share was created on the local computer.

CAUSE
=====

The message "Invalid UID or TID" is returned internally because the SMBs
SrvSmbSessionSetupAndX and SrvSmbTreeConnectAndX haven't occurred yet.

WORKAROUND
==========

After doing the NetShareAdd, call FindFirstFile more than once. After the first
call, the error is not returned.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the correct SHARE_INFO_502 structure, the following code would cause this
error:

   ret = NetShareAdd(TEXT("\\\\SERVER"),502, (LPBYTE)&si_502,NULL);

   if ( ret != 0)
   {
      wprintf(TEXT("NetShareAdd() error!"));
      return;
   }

   if((fh=FindFirstFile(TEXT("\\\\SERVER\\TEST\\*"),&wfd))==
   INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE){
      ErrorHandler(TEXT("FindFirstFile() failed!"));}

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server and
Workstation version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
