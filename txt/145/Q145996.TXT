TITLE   :FIX: _setmaxstdio Causes Access Violation
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCRT kbVC kbVC410fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C Run-Time (CRT), used with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The CRT function _setmaxstdio does not work properly. The function sets the
maximum number of files an application can open with the stream I/O functions,
like fopen. It is documented in the README book in the online documentation, and
in the Vcread.wri file.

Using _setmaxstdio results in the following error when you exit the program or
call the fopen function:

   Unhandled exception in <Project>.exe: 0xC0000005: Access Violation

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use the _setmaxstdio function. Here are two workarounds:

 - Keep track of the number of files opened with fopen, and do not open more
   than 512.

-or-

 - If the application needs to open more than 512 files, use the low-level I/O
   functions: _open, _read, and _write. These allow up to 2048 files to be
   opened.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 4.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------------

   /* Compile options needed: none
   */ 

   #include <stdio.h>

   void main()
   {
       _setmaxstdio(511);
       FILE *text = fopen("textfile.txt","w");
       fclose(text);
   }
