TITLE   :XCLN: Upgrading From SFS Mail to Exchange Causes E-Forms
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After upgrading to Microsoft Exchange, Electronic Forms Designer 1.0 based forms
may no longer work correctly if run from previous versions of Microsoft Mail.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The files needed to launch the old e-forms have been changed
and migrated to the new format for Microsoft Exchange. These e-forms will work
correctly if used from within the Microsoft Exchange client.

When you start previous mail programs (MS Mail versions 3.x), to send a message
or retrieve a note, some functions, such as those needed by the e-forms
designer, will no longer work correctly. This is because the old MAPI.DLL has
been replaced by a newer version and, depending on the client, MAILSPL.EXE has
been renamed and is no longer used.
