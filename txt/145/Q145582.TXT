TITLE   :SMS Only Reports 16mb RAM On MS-DOS and Windows Systems
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On many Intel x86-based computers, Systems Management Server (SMS) reports an
MS-DOS, Windows or Windows 95 system that contains more than 16mb of RAM as only
having 16mb total.

The MS-DOS MEM.COM and MSD.EXE commands also report only 16mb even though a PC
hardware memory test counts the correct amount of memory.

CAUSE
=====

This is due to how the hardware reports its memory configuration to MS-DOS. SMS
queries MS-DOS with the same mechanism as MSD and the MS-DOS MEM command to
determine the amount of memory reported. If MS-DOS has the incorrect value, it
reports this incorrect amount to all 3 programs.

This is also the case with Windows 95 systems, as INVDOS for SMS 1.1 is used for
all MS-DOS and Non-NT Windows clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
