TITLE   :PRB: Remote View of 2.x Table Changes Numeric Field Data Type
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a remote view based on a FoxPro 2.x table and a numeric field is
present, the view will change the data type of the field to a double that
defaults to two decimal places.

CAUSE
=====

The field type is determined by the ODBC driver in use.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before the view is opened for a browse, issue the following command:

      =DBSETPROP('<View_name.fieldname>','field','datatype','n(<nX>,<nY>)')

In this example, the <View_name.fieldname> is the name of the remote view
and field. The <nX>, <nY> in the n parameters should be replaced
with the original field size followed by a comma and then the original decimal
places.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Copy the Invoices table from FoxPro for MS-DOS 2.6 or FoxPro for Windows 2.6
   into your default Visual FoxPro directory.

2. Modify a database, and create a new remote view.

3. Select Available data sources, and choose FoxPro Files from the list.

4. When the Open dialog box appears, choose the Invoices table.

5. Choose your fields to display, and then run the query.

6. You should notice that the INO field in the view now has a decimal point with
   two zeros.

7. Type the following command in the command window:

         ?DBGETPROP('remote view name.fieldname', 'field', 'datatype')

   Notice it returns b(8,2), indicating a datatype of Double.

8. Type the following command in the command window:

         ?DBSSETPROP('remote view name.fieldname',  ;
            'field','datatype','n(4,0)')

   This will set the data type back to its correct value.
