TITLE   :FIX: SQLSetProp() Without Expression Does Not Restore Defaults
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Leaving off the optional [eExpression] in SQLSetProp() may not restore Visual
FoxPro defaults for all SQL properties.

WORKAROUND
==========

The values must be set manually, instead of relying on SQLSetProp() to restore
the default values.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The help file describes eExpression as "specifies the value for the setting you
designate with cSetting. If you omit eExpression, the default value is restored
for the setting."

However, the following properties are not restored to their default settings when
leaving eExpression off:

   WaitTime - Resets to zero and default is 100
   Transactions - Gives error message "Property value is out of bounds"
   DispLogin - Gives error message "Property value is out of bounds"
   BatchMode - Resets to false (.F.)

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Type the following commands in the Command Window:

      x = SQLCONN()                  && You can use any data source.
      ?SQLGetProp(x,"WaitTime")      && Returns 100
      ?SQLSetProp(x,"WaitTime",200)  && Returns 1
      ?SQLGetProp(x,"WaitTime")      && Returns 200
      ?SQLSetProp(x,"WaitTime")      && Returns 1
      ?SQLGetProp(x,"WaitTime")      && Returns 0!
      ?SQLDisConn(x)

The last call to SQLGetProp() returns 0 when the default for WaitTime is 100.
