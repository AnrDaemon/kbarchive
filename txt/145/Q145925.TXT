The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Win32 SDK, Japanese Edition, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows 95 Japanese Edition does not and will not support keisen (ruled
line) character attributes for the SetConsoleTextAttribute API. Keisen are
incorporated into Windows NT for OS/2-J console applications compatibility.

These attributes are designed for IBM-J's local video display adapter's
hardware attribute sets.

The include file Wincon.h includes the keisen attribute settings for
lead/trail byte, reverse fore/back ground, overline/underline, left and
right line. However, these attributes are ignored by the Windows 95
implementation of SetConsoleTextAttribute.
