SYMPTOMS
========

If you double-click an HTML file in File Manager, (for example: c:\MyPage.htm)
Internet Explorer displays the following error message:

   This program does not support the protocol for accessing
   'Files:///c:\MyPage.htm'

CAUSE
=====

When you install Internet Explorer, it adds a new association for HTML files.
However, the association contains a syntax error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Open File Manager.

2. Select Associate from the File menu.

3. From the Files with Extension menu, select HTM. You see htm(c:\<correct
   Path>\iexplore.exe) in the "Associate With:" dialog box.
   htm(c:\<correct Path>\iexplore.exe) is highlighted.

4. Click the Change type... button.

5. Change the text in the Command: text box from:

   c:\<correct Path>\iexplore.exe files:///%1"

   to

   c:\<correct Path>\iexplore.exe file:///%1"

   NOTE: Change the word "files" to "file".

6. Click the OK button.

7. Click the OK button.
