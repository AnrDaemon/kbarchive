TITLE   :XCLN: Insert Message View Shows Incorrect List
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0 RC2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, when you insert a message into a newly composed
message, the Insert Message dialog box shows the incorrect view.

CAUSE
=====

If you enable and then remove an Inbox filter, when you attempt to insert a
message into a new message, the list of available messages is that of the
filtered Inbox and not of the actual Inbox. The problem is the views do not get
refreshed timely when doing an Insert Message.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can change focus to another folder, then change back to the Inbox. This
forces a refresh of the Folder view, and the correct view will then be used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange version
4.0 Windows clients. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
