TITLE   :XCLN: No Read Receipt Indicator for Message Headers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using the Microsoft Exchange Remote Client to view message headers, the
properties dialog does not indicate that the incoming message is requesting a
Read Receipt. Therefore, you cannot avoid downloading a message with a Read
Receipt in order to prevent the automatic response being sent during the next
mail transfer.


STATUS
======

With the current design, there is no way to verify if a message is requesting a
Read Receipt from within the Remote Mail viewer. The Read Receipt property is
not displayed due to performance reasons. Also, unlike the Microsoft Mail Remote
client, the Read Receipt icon (!) will not be displayed beside the message. (In
Microsoft Exchange, the red "!" icon indicates Importance High.)
