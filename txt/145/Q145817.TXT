-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Visual FoxPro, you can format date type input data as {mm/dd/yy}, or, if you
type directly in a date field, as mm/dd/yy. However, when you perform a remote
query on an SQL table and format the data in this fashion, an ODBC error is the
result.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If, in a remote query, you pass date, time, or timestamp values to an SQL table,
you need to format the data with the following escape clauses:

 - Date value: {d 'yyyy-mm-dd'}, where yyyy represents the year, mm the month,
   and dd the day.

 - Time value: {t 'hh:mm:ss'}, where hh represents the hours, mm the minutes,
   and ss the seconds.

 - Timestamp value: {ts 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss'}.

In a SQL Pass Through command, you can use the following syntax to retrieve the
value of a date field:

      =SQLEXEC( nConnHandle, "SELECT * FROM TITLES WHERE
         Titles.pubdate<{ts '1995-06-12 12:55:00'}", 'MyCursor')

You can use the following syntax to create a remote view that queries datetime
information:

      CREATE SQL VIEW sqldate REMOTE CONNECTION sqldate AS SELECT * FROM ;
         dbo.titles WHERE Titles.pubdate<{ts '1985-06-12 12:55:00'}

In the View Designer, ensure that the date, the time, or the timestamp values are
formatted as needed in the Examples field of the Selection Criteria tab. Once
the view is saved, the information in the Examples field is saved with the view.
If the view is opened and modified, the information disappears and has to be
typed back in the Examples field.


Note that when you pass the field name (not a value) as a parameter to a remote
query, you do not receive an ODBC error because Visual FoxPro performs a
conversion.
