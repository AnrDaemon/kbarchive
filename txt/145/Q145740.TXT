SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to start a Dial-Up Networking connection using a
command line in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To start a Dial-Up Networking connection using a command line, use the following
syntax

   rundll rnaui.dll,RnaDial <connectoid>

where <connectoid> is the name of the connection you want to start.

For example, to start a connection named "My Connection," use the following
command line:

   rundll rnaui.dll,RnaDial My Connection

You can use this command line in an MS-DOS session, or by clicking the Start
button, clicking Run, and then typing the line in the Open box.

Notes
-----

 - The RnaDial and <connectoid> components of the command line are case
   sensitive, and the location of spaces and commas is critical.

 - Although you can start a Dial-Up Networking connection using a command line,
   you cannot start the Dial-Up Networking Server using a command line.
