SYMPTOMS
========

When you paste an appointment from the Clipboard, the start time of the new
(pasted) appointment is the start time you selected for the new appointment. The
ending time of the appointment is determined by the length of the appointment.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The described behavior is expected.

When an appointment is pasted from the Clipboard, the start of the appointment is
the start of the time you selected, and the end of the appointment is based on
the length of the appointment in the Clipboard. MORE INFORMATION
