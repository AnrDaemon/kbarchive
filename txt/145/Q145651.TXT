SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running a multi-threaded Windows Sockets program using the IPX
protocol, Windows 95 may stop responding (hang), or you may receive an error
message similar to the following on a blue screen:

   An exception 0E has occurred at [segment]:[address] in VxD WSIPX(01) +
   [offset]. This was called from [segment]:[address] in VxD NWLINK(01) +
   [offset]. It may be possible to continue normally.

CAUSE
=====

When a multi-threaded Windows Sockets program uses the IPX protocol, a page
fault can occur if an invalid pointer to a buffer used by Windows Sockets over
IPX is used.

Note that this error occurs only with multi-threaded Windows Sockets programs; it
does not occur with single-threaded programs.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
