TITLE   :FIX: CDC::CreatePointFont() May Create Wrong Size Font
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0

KEYWORDS:kbcode kbDocView kbFont kbGDI kbMFC kbVC400bug kbVC410fix kbNoUpdate

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Calling CDC::CreatePointFont() results in a font that is not of the point size
requested. This will occur when the y component of the DC's viewport origin is
not at 0. A common place for this to occur would be in a CScrollView class where
the user has scrolled the view vertically.

CAUSE
=====

MFC uses DPtoLP() to map the given device coordinates to logical coordinates.
The case where the viewport origin is not at 0 is not taken into consideration
by this code.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the y component of the viewport origin to 0 before calling
CreatePointFont(). The following code demonstrates the workaround. Here pDC is a
pointer to a CDC.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed: default
   */ 
   POINT pt;
   SetViewportOrgEx(pDC->GetSafeHdc(), 0, 0, &pt); // set origin to 0,0
   CreatePointFont(120, "Courier", pDC);
   SetViewportOrgEx(pDC->GetSafeHdc(), pt.x, pt,y, NULL); // restore origin

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 4.1.
