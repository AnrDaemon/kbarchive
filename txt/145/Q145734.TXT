-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install a printer in Windows NT 3.51, the following error
message appears:

   The application or dll ./devices/<drive>:/<%SystemRoot%>/system32
   /spool/drivers/w32x86/rasddui.dll is not a valid Windows NT image. Please
   check this against your installation diskette.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Print Manager is not able to load RASDDUI.DLL due to
heavy I/O stress of the computer. The RASDDUI.DLL is unloaded if Windows NT has
been using it before installing the printer. This problem may occur with files
other than RASDDUI.DLL.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest US Service Pack for Windows NT. For

the file from the Windows NT 3.51 CD-ROM disc.

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 2.
