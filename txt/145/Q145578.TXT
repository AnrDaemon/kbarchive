If you change the drive letter of the system drive to "unassigned", after
rebooting the following error message appears:

   STOP: c000021a {Fatal System Error}
   The Session Manager Initialization system process terminated unexpectedly with
   a status of 0xC000003a (0x00000000 0x00000000).
   The system has shutdown.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one of the following:

 - You must use the Emergency Repair Disk and replace the system hive of the
   registry or re-install Windows NT. Selecting "Last Known Good" will not
   correct this problem.

   -or-

 - Install Windows NT to a separate directory and modify the registry of the
   original Windows NT that experiences the symptom above.

   WARNING 1: If you have implemented any of the Microsoft Software Fault
   Tolerance solutions, including mirroring, stripe sets and volume sets in
   Windows NT, do NOT perform the following procedures.

   WARNING 2: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

   1. Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and locate and select the
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree.

   2. From the Registry menu, select Load Hive.

   3. Find the file that contains the Hive in the following directory of the
      original Windows NT installation that experiences the symptom above:
      %SystemRoot%\System32\Config\System

   4. In the Load Hive dialog box, type TEMP for the key name.

   5. A new TEMP hive is now listed. In TEMP, find and select Disk.

   6. From the Edit menu, select Binary.

   7. Delete all the binary information.

   8. Click OK and select TEMP.

   9. From the Registry menu, select Unload Hive. This unloads the hive from the
      current session and saves it to the original Windows NT location.

   10. Quit Registry Editor.

   11. Shut down and restart the original installation of Windows NT.
