SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to place OLE information into a SQL table by using the
SQL Pass Through (SPT) function SQLEXEC(). To achieve this, you need to pass the
field as a parameter instead of passing a file name value.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To place an OLE object such as a .wav or an .avi file into an Image field in a
SQL table, you need to store it in a Visual FoxPro general field, and then call
INSERT INTO to insert the general field in an Image field. For example, you can
use the following syntax if you have a connection to a data source and you want
to store the OLE information to an image field named imagfld:

      = SQLEXEC(mhandle,"INSERT INTO test(field1,imagfld);
          VALUES('Sound',?table.g_fld)")

In this example, the field name of the local table is passed as a parameter to
the server. This ensures that Visual FoxPro preserves the binary format of the
OLE object.

Note that if you pass the .wav file name in the INSERT command and bring the
information back to Visual FoxPro, the error "OLE Object is invalid" is
displayed when you click the General field. If you have an OLE object that is
not stored in a .dbf file, you can create a temporary cursor and store the file
in a cursor before you upload it. For example:

      CREATE CURSOR tmpole (g_fld G)
      APPEND BLANK
      APPEND GENERAL g_fld FROM "C:\win95\media\chimes.wav"
