SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector recipient (ADMINSCH) is not hidden
from the Global Address List so that this address is exported along with other
recipients during Directory Synchronization with Microsoft Mail postoffices.

The Microsoft Mail Schedule+ distribution program (SCHDIST.EXE) needs to find an
ADMINSCH mailbox in the user list of each remote postoffice and this includes
Exchange. If this mailbox is not found in the user list of a postoffice, that
postoffice is not included in Schedule Distribution.

Similarly, the Free/Busy gateway in Microsoft Exchange also requires an ADMINSCH
account in the user list received from each Microsoft Mail Postoffice during
Directory Synchronization. If you check the properties for the Sched+ Free/Busy
Connector you can see the Alias name is ADMINSCH.
