SUMMARY
=======

There are two Setup.exe files on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. One is located in the
root folder of the CD-ROM and is 3664 bytes in size, while the other is in the
Win95 folder and is 5184 bytes in size.

Note that the version of the Setup.exe file in the root folder of the CD-ROM is
not a beta copy or a damaged version of the Setup.exe file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the Setup.exe file located in the root folder of the CD-ROM to start
Setup without manually changing to the Win95 folder first. This version of
Setup.exe calls a file in the Win95 folder called Suhelper.bin, which unloads
the original Setup.exe and then loads the version of Setup.exe in the Win95
folder. Suhelper.bin also passes any command-line parameters to the version of
Setup.exe in the Win95 folder. Setup then continues normally.

Suhelper.bin is necessary because there can be only one instance of Setup.exe
loaded in memory at a time.
