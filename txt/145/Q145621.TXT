SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS), the
print banner settings on a captured NDS printer may be reset to the default
values after you restart your computer. For example, the Banner check box and
the Banner description box on the Capture Settings tab may be reset.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the RestorePersistentCaptureFlags function in the
Nwnp32.dll file incorrectly restores the capture flag settings.
