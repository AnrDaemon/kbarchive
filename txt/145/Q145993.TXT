TITLE   :BUG: Crystal Reports AppWizard Disables Multi-Language Support
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.1,4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbMFC kbVC400bug kbVC410bug kbVC420bug kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The AppWizard, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Step One of the MFC AppWizard, it is possible to select the language of the
resources (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish). However, if you select
the Crystal Reports AppWizard and then select MFC AppWizard, it disables
multi-language resource options for MFC AppWizard in Step One.


RESOLUTION
==========

Exit MSDEV, and run it again. If you create a new workspace using MFC AppWizard,
you will see English as well as the other language choice resources in Step One.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

   present.
