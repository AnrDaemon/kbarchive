TITLE   :XCLN: Shiva Does Not Always Prompt to Hang Up Connection
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbinterop

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Shiva does not always prompt you to Hang-up the connection. It neither hangs up
the connection nor displays a prompt.

WORKAROUND
==========

Because the Shiva software supports MS-DOS operations, as well as Windows, the
Connectw.exe program will not disconnect if it is exited to support further
connection status with MS-DOS applications. You are not prompted to terminate
the connection.

You can leave the Connectw.exe application running minimized and it will
disconnect properly.

This is a Shiva issue.

Additional query words: third party modem dialup
