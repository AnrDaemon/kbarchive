-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information on configuring permissions for Windows NT
accounts in the Administrator program of Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the Permissions property page to specify the rights that users or groups
have on the Configuration container.

Permissions that you set on the Configuration container are inherited by all
objects and containers within the Configuration container. For example, a user
with Modify Permissions rights on the Configuration container is able to modify
permissions on all subordinate containers and objects of the Configuration
container.

If permissions are set on the Site container, they are only inherited by the
recipients container. This is useful for allocating permissions for Admin
Operators who are only required to add/modify user mailboxes and not change any
of the Connectors, Directory Replication, and Server configurations.
