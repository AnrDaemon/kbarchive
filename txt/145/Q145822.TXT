SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for creating an import library for Apple Code Fragment shared
libraries in "Visual C++ Porting Applications to the Macintosh," Chapter 19
(Macintosh Shared Libraries) under "Code Fragment Manager Shared Libraries"
contain various documentation errors. This article gives the correct
documentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The steps to create an import library should read as follows:

1. Use the MFILE COPY command to copy the code fragment library file from the
   Macintosh to your computer.

         MFILE COPY ":MACINTOSH HD:MYLIB" MYLIB

2. Use the dumpbin utility to place all exported functions and variables into a
   file called MY.EXPORTS.

         DUMPBIN /EXPORTS MYLIB > MY.EXPORTS

3. Edit MY.EXPORTS to get just the names of the exported symbols.

4. Create a .DEF file (MYLIB.DEF) that contains the following lines:

         LIBRARY  MYLIBNAME
         EXPORTS

   Here MYLIBNAME is the fragment name from the 'cfrg' resource in the Macintosh
   shared library, and the list of export names in MY.EXPORTS is placed after
   the EXPORTS keyword.

5. Use the LIB utility to create MYLIBNAME.LIB.

         LIB /MACHINE:MPPC /DEF:MYLIB.DEF
