SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Internet Mail Connector (IMC) supports the Multipurpose Internet
Message Extentions (MIME) standard. This allows the IMC to send and receive
messages with attachments to and from other MIME compliant systems.

The IMC is compliant with RFC 1521 "MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
Part One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet
Message Bodies." This RFC document sets standards for the format of message
bodies to allow multi-part textual and non-textual message bodies to be
represented and exchanged without loss of information.

As per this RFC, the IMC expects messages received from the Internet to specify
attachment filenames using the "filename=" parameter on the "Content-Type" MIME
header. The IMC also uses this format to specify attachment filenames when
sending out messages containing attachments.

The IMC also recognizes the "Content-Disposition" MIME header and can read
attachment filenames in incoming messages if they are specified with this
header. However, the IMC will not use this header when sending messages out to
the Internet.
