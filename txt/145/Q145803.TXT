KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Pregnancy and Child Care, Preview on MSN 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to print an Overview, only the Copy option is available. The
Print option is not available (dimmed).

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, capture the screen image into the Clipboard and
paste the graphic image into a word processing application such as WordPad.

To capture the image, do the following:

1. Make sure the Overview window is open.

2. Press and hold down the ALT keyboard key while you press the PRINT SCRN
   keyboard key. This copies the screen image to your Windows Clipboard.

3. Paste the image into your word processing program. For more information about
   how to accomplish this task, see the instructions for your word processing
   program.

   NOTE: The word processing application must be capable of accepting a graphic
   image.
