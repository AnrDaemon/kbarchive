TITLE   :FIX: DUMPBIN, LIB, and EDITBIN Fail on File Names with Spaces
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVC410fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Linker (LINK.EXE) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The command-line utilities Dumpbin.exe, Editbin.exe, and Lib.exe do not accept
file names that contain embedded spaces. For example, this code:

      DUMPBIN /ALL "my test.obj"

results in this error:

   DUMPBIN : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file "my"

CAUSE
=====

Dumpbin.exe, Lib.exe, and Editbin.exe are front-end utilities that spawn and
pass their arguments to Link.exe. When the front-end utility parses its command
line, it strips the quotation marks. This stripped argument is passed to Link
.exe by the spawning program.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use LINK with the file names that contain embedded spaces instead of using the
front-end utilities. The syntax is:

      LINK  /<Link Utility Switch>  [Utility Arguments]

Here [Utility Arguments] is the list of arguments for the front-end utility.

Front-End Utility Link Utility Switch

EDITBIN.EXE         /EDIT
DUMPBIN.EXE         /DUMP
LIB.EXE             /LIB

For example, the equivalent of:

      DUMP /ALL "my test.obj"

is:

      LINK /DUMPBIN /ALL "my test.obj"

Similarly, LINK /LIB is equivalent to LIB and LINK /EDIT is equivalent to
EDITBIN.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 4.1.
