======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0, 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Developer Studio does not detect changes to project files located on remote
computers when those project files are modified by an external source on a
remote computer. This occurs when Developer Studio is running on Windows 95,
Windows 98, or Windows Millennium Edition (Me). It may also occur on Windows NT
or Windows 2000 when the remote files are on network servers that are not
running Windows.


CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs on networked systems that do not support the file change
notification functions defined in the Win32 API.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around problem 1, you need to reload the file manually.

To work around problem 2, you need to do a Rebuild All of the project, rather
than a Build.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two ways this problem manifests:

1. If a remote file is open in Developer Studio and is modified by an external
   source, Developer Studio should notify the user that the file has been
   changed outside of the source editor and prompts the user to reload the file.
   However, there is no notification.

2. If a remote file is modified by an external source on a remote computer and a
   build is launched, Developer Studio does not detect it. It will not recompile
   the file or do whatever build step is necessary to rebuild files that are
   dependent on the remote file.

Additional query words: modify update dependency
