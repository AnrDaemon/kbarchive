TITLE   :XCLN: Err Msg: The Folder Could Not Be Opened...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When accessing a mailbox folder which you have full owner permissions, you may
get the following error message if you do not have proper access permissions:

When using Microsoft Exchange version 4.0 clients -

   The Folder could not be opened. You do not have sufficient permission to
   perform this operation on this object. See the folder contact or your system
   administrator.

When using Microsoft Exchange version 5.0 clients -

   The folder could not be opened. The client operation failed.

NOTE: The properties for this mailbox will show that you are the owner of the
mailbox.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The Microsoft Exchange Permission User Interface (UI), used
by private and public Exchange stores, does not allow you to set recursive
permissions on folders.

WORKAROUND
==========

You must set each folders permission individually.

MORE INFORMATION
================

New sub-folders will inherit the properties of their parent folder when they are
created; however, the permissions of the existing sub-folders will not be
modified.

If you are given permissions to a folder, and a sub-folder is created, you will
have the same permissions to the sub-folder that you have to the parent folder.
If you are given permissions to the parent folder after the sub-folder is
created, you will not have permissions to the sub-folder.
