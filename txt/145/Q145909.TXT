TITLE   :FPNW: Invalid User Name Consumes a Seat License
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Novell NetWare client logs into File and Print Services for NetWare
(FPNW) with a user name that is not known in the local user account database or
in any trusted domain, the login fails.

Although the login failed, FPNW reports a license usage to the licensing server
if it is set up in per seat licensing mode. Therefore, the License Manager list
of per seat licenses for File and Print Services may become filled with invalid
user names. If the license limit is reached, the administrator has to use
License Manager and manually delete invalid user accounts.

CAUSE
=====

FPNW registers the user with License Manager before it tries to logon the user.
FPNW does not have the SID so it reports the user by name. Any misspelled user
name or logon attack against FPNW uses one per seat license.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for
NetWare version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 4.0.

Additional query words: 4.00
