Notes about Adobe Acrobat Reader
--------------------------------

Text pasted from Adobe Acrobat Reader retains its character level formatting (for
example, fonts, bold, italic, underline, color, and so on). However, some
reformatting of the text after you paste it into Microsoft Word is probably
necessary.

If security has been set in a PDF file, you may be unable to select and copy the
contents of the PDF document for use in Word.
