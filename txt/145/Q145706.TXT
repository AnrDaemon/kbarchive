The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you are using the Microsoft Schedule+ 7.0 Windows Client and have never
opened your Microsoft Schedule+ file, you will not have a <username>.SCD
file on your local machine. If you receive a meeting request, Microsoft
Schedule+ will book the meeting for you and place it on your mail server's copy
of your schedule.

When you open Microsoft Schedule+ for the first time you will be prompted to
choose a name for your local .SCD file. Upon viewing your new Microsoft
Schedule+ file, the events booked prior to this that were placed on the server
will not be visible.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to see events booked prior to first use, you should synchronize your
.SCD file with the server. Synchronize Now can be found by clicking on Options
on the Tools menu. Microsoft Schedule+ does not check the server for
appointments made prior to the first use nor automatically synchronize the .SCD
files. A newly created .SCD file will not prompt Microsoft Schedule+ to
synchronize it with the server.

Additional query words: 7.0 schedule plus
