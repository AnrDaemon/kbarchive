TITLE   :XCLN: "Close and Return" from Word Doesn't Return to Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you open a Microsoft Word document that has been dragged from Windows
Explorer or the Windows File Manager and copied into either a shared or personal
folder, Word maintains an OLE connection to the document. When you choose Close
And Return To Exchange on the Word File menu, the document closes, but you are
not returned to Microsoft Exchange.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs because Word's File Close command has "and return to
Microsoft Exchange" appended to the Close menu because Word was launched as an
OLE server. This same behavior is seen in other applications that are launched
as OLE servers.
