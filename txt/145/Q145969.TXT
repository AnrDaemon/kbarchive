TITLE   :XADM: Incorrect Network Drive Confirmation Dialogs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.00 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a System Administrator attempts to create a Microsoft Exchange network
share point on a Novell Netware server, an incorrect dialog box path might be
displayed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Administrator is prompted for the network location to install the Microsoft
Exchange files during the normal course of creating the client share point. They
are also prompted for the location of the MSAPPS shared files directory (MSAPPS
includes spell checking).

If the Administrator enters a Novell Server as the network location, after they
have confirmed it, a confirmation dialog box might appear with the network path
displayed with three backslashes. Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem
with ACME Setup.

ACME Setup is the program used by many Microsoft products to provide a
standardized, customizable installation routine. Depending on the version of
ACME setup used by a given program, this problem may appear. Since ACME Setup is
independent of Microsoft Exchange, it is possible that this problem will appear
with the installation of other programs as well.
