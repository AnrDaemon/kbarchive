-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Mac OS (all) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a mail message in the Inbox by double-clicking it, you may get the
following Apple Macintosh System error:

   Sorry, a system error of type 10 or 11 occurred.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Macintosh is an Apple PowerBook series computer
connected to the local area network (LAN) via a Farallon Ethernet PCMCIA card.

According to Farallon, the card cannot maintain a stable network connection to
either Microsoft Windows NT or Novell NetWare servers. As a result, you can not
open the mail message and get the corresponding system error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Farallon has an updated driver for their Ethernet PCMCIA cards that will resolve
this problem. For information on how to obtain this new driver, please contact
Farallon Technical Support at (510) 814-5000.
