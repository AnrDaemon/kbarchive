SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Internet Explorer version 1.5, you may get the following
STOP message:

   Unable to save C:\TEMP\<filename>. Disk may be full.
   The attempt to load ftp:<filename> failed.

CAUSE
=====

This may not be due to a full disk problem, as stated in the error. The problem
can be due to the client browser not providing a \temp directory.

Create a temp directory off the root of the boot drive. For example: "C:\TEMP".
