SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to join a multiplayer game of Microsoft Urban Assault, the
Start button may not be displayed on the Start Game screen after you click I Am
Ready.

This behavior can occur if the host of the multiplayer game exits from the game
before a client has joined the game, and then attempts to rejoin the multiplayer
game as a client.

RESOLUTION

To prevent this issue from occurring, the host of the multiplayer game must not
exit from the game until a client has joined the game.

1.0.
