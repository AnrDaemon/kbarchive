TITLE   :SMS: Retaining Status Summaries After Advertisement Done
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbStatSum

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you delete an advertisement, the status summary for the advertisement is
also deleted. This prevents a build-up of obsolete status summaries. However,
you may want to maintain the status summaries after you are done using the
advertisement for a variety of reasons, such as:

 - You expect status information to continue to arrive from child sites.

 - You want to collect status information on advertisements over time.

 - The advertisement was a pilot project, and you want to analyze the summary
   data as you plan the full rollout.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To stop an advertisement but maintain the status summary for the advertisement,
do either of the following:

 - Set the expiration time for the advertisement to a time in the past, as
   follows:

   1. Open the SMS Administrator console and expand Site Database. Then expand
      Advertisements.

   2. Right-click the advertisement you want to modify, and then click
      Properties on the shortcut menu.

   3. Click the Schedule tab.

   4. Set the Advertisement Will Expire to a time in the past. As little as a
      minute before the present is sufficient.

   The advertisement and its status summary continue to exist but the
   advertisement no longer runs on clients.

 - Disable the program, as follows:

   1. Open the SMS Administrator console and expand Site Database. Then expand
      Packages, expand the package you want to modify, and expand Programs.

   2. Right-click the program you want to modify, and then click Properties on
      the shortcut menu.

   3. Click the Advanced tab.

   4. Select the Disable this program on computers where it is advertised
      checkbox.

   This prevents any advertisement from running the program. The advertisement
   and its status summary continue to exist in the Administrator Console, but
   the advertisement for the program no longer runs on clients.
