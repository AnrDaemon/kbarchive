======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Active Server Pages 
 - ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), versions 1.5, 2.0, 2.01, 2.1, 2.1 SP1, 2.1 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Active Server Pages (ASP) and ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) cannot access a
Microsoft Access database across a universal naming convention (UNC) Path. The
following error message is generated:

   Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80004005' [Microsoft][ODBC
   Microsoft Access 97 Driver]
   The Microsoft Jet database engine cannot open the file '(unknown)'. It is
   already opened exclusively by another user, or you need permission to view
   its data.
   /scripts/default.asp, line 11

CAUSE
=====

Internet Information Server (IIS) is not passing valid credentials to the share.
This behavior could occur because:

 - The Web page's authenticated user, often the IUSR_Servername account, is not
   a valid account on the computer that is hosting the database file.

   -or-

 - IIS is passing a secondary token for the account that does not have
   permission to access the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Resolution 1:

This is more of an example of how to set this up assuming the following
conditions:

Webserver name: Server1

Database resides on the following share: \\Server2\Sharefolder\db.mdb

ConnectionString used:

   Set CN=Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
   CN.Open "DBQ=\\Server2\Sharefolder\db.mdb"

1. On both Server1 and Server2, create an Microsoft Windows NT account named
   "Server1Guest" (without the quotation marks) and give it the same password.*
   See NOTE.

2. On Server2, make sure that this account has sufficient privileges to access
   the database.

3. Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) on Server1. Drill down to your
   application, right-click on it, and then click to open Properties.

4. On the Security tab, make sure that the Allow Anonymous option is enabled.
   Click the Edit button for this option twice so that you are viewing the
   Account. It will usually be "IUSR_Server1."

5. Deselect Enable Password Synchronization, and change the user and password to
   Server1Guest and whatever password that you have chosen. DO NOT re-select
   Enable Password Synchronization.

6. Recycle the Web server. On the Start menu, select Run, and then type:

   "net stop iisadmin /y
   net start W3SVC" (without the quotation marks)

7. On Server1 in NT Explorer, make sure that Server1Guest has permissions to
   Inetpub/wwwroot/AppName and its subdirectories.

   *NOTE: This can be any valid NT Username, and you may leave it as
   IUSR_Server1. You must change the password and make sure that the Username
   and the password are EXACTLY the same in IIS on Server1, and in the User
   Manager for Domains in both Server1 and Server2.

Resolution 2.

1. Map a drive (x:) to the share and have it connect as someuser.

2. Create your ODBC connection to the mapped drive (x:\directory\database.mdb).

3. Set the virtual directory that the ASP is running under to: Run in separate
   memory space.

4. Create an IWAM_<computer name> account on the share computer and give
   it a password.

5. Grant that user the appropriate rights to the files and directory.

6. Synchronize the password that you assigned to the IWAM account on the
   ShareComputer with the IISComputer.

7. On the IISComputer, open the Internet Service Manager and expand the
   Microsoft Transaction Server folder until you reach the Packages Installed
   folder.

8. Highlight the following package name: IIS - {<Web site
   name>//Root/<virtual directory name>}, and choose Properties.

9. Click on the Identity tab and type in the password that you used for the
   IWAM_<computer name> account.

10. Stop and restart the Virtual Web site.

When you run a virtual directory in its own memory space, it runs as the
IWAM_<computer name> account. However, during the installation of IIS,
that account never gets a password. When you create the account for the share
computer, you must give it a password and synchronize the account passwords with
the IISComputer. The only step that is missing is the specification of the the
account password for the package that IIS creates.
