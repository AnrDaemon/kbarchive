SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to export a registry key with new default regional

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Regional Settings.

3. Make the appropriate changes to the settings, click OK, and the close Control
   Panel.

4. Use Registry Editor to export the following key to a file named
   Regional.reg:

   HKEY_USERS\.Default\Control Panel\International

5. Copy the Regional.reg file to other computers, double-click the file to load
   the new settings, and then restart the computer to cause the new settings to
   take effect.

NOTE: If the above registry key does not reflect the changes you made to the
regional settings, you may have user profiles enabled on the computer. If user
profiles are enabled, the changed default regional settings are not maintained
after the computer is rebooted. For more information about this issue, see the
