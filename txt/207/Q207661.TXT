-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer versions 1.0, 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When passing an argument to the Watch feature of the Systems Management Server
Installer, the following error might appear:

   The file C:\winnt\program.exe argument is not a valid Win32 application. You
   must use the 32-bit edition of the Microsoft SMS Installer to run Win32
   applications and the 16-bit edition to run Win16 applications.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server Installer Watch function executes the entire
string passed to it from the Watch "Application Path" line.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, put the command line with the arguments in a batch
file and call the batch file from the Systems Management Server Installer Watch
"Application Path."
