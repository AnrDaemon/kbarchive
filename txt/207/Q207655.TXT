PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2, 3 
 - Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up Web Publishing and Outlook Web Access (OWA)
on the same server, or on different servers. This enables users to access their
Exchange mailboxes through the Internet by means of the proxy server and host
their company's main Web site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Start the Internet Service Manager (ISM), which loads the Internet
   Information Server snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

2. On the Action menu, click Web Proxy, and click Properties.

3. On the Publishing tab, click to select the Enable Web Publishing check box.

4. Select "Send incoming requests to the local server".

5. Add an exception to send requests for

   http://<FQDN>/exchange/

   -to-

   http://<Server>/exchange/

   Where:

   FQDN = The registered MX record
   Server = The NetBIOS name or IP address of the Exchange Server running.

6. When accessing OWA, use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the
   Exchange Server computer.

If the Proxy Server, IIS Server, Exchange Server and OWA are running on the same
computer, it is not necessary to set an exception for OWA. However, the Default
Web Site's IP Address should be bound to "All Unassigned".

If the Proxy Server and the Outlook Web Access server are on different servers,
you will need to add an exception to send requests for:

   http://<FQDN>/exchange/

   -to-

   http://<Server>/exchange/

Where:

   FQDN = The Fully Qualified Domain Name of the Proxy server
   Server = The NetBIOS name or IP address of the IIS server running Outlook Web
   Access.
