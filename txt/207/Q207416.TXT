TITLE   :SMS: Distribution Manager Does Not Process a New Package
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbPackage kbSoftwareDist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server (SMS) Distribution Manager may not process the
source files for a Software Distribution package as expected; in this scenario,
the Distmgr.log file may log the following error:

   Error 32: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by
   another process.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the directory chosen for the source is frequently
used by the system or other applications -- for example, the TEMP directory. If
the source directory is being used by another program or process, the source
files for the package may become locked, thereby preventing the Distribution
Manager from gaining access to the file.

This behavior can also occur if a file window (using My Computer) or Microsoft
Windows Explorer is currently viewing the directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, ensure that the source directory is not in use when
you create the package. Also, create a separate source and ensure that all
source files for the new package are copied to that directory. SMS considers all
files and sub-folders within this location to be source files for the package.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Log entries in the Distmgr.log and status messages in the Distribution Manager
component status node of the Administrator console indicate the number of
retries already attempted and the latest status of the operation. Distribution
Manager retries the operation if it triggers an error 32.
