The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When compiling a Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic (VBCE) application which
includes a Declare statement, the following error message may appear:

   The Declare statement is incorrectly formatted. Please see the documentation
   for more information on the format of a Declare statement.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Winceapi.txt file incorrectly includes some Declare statements that include
parameters declared as "Any". This is not supported in Windows CE. By changing
the declaration of the parameters to another data type, such as Long, the error
will be avoided.

For example, the following Declare statement needs to be changed:

   Declare Function SendMessage Lib "Coredll" Alias "SendMessageW" ( _
      ByVal hwnd As Long, _
      ByVal wMsg As Long, _
      ByVal wParam As Long, _
      lParam As Any) As Long

The statement can be changed to the following:

   Declare Function SendMessage Lib "Coredll" Alias "SendMessageW" ( _
       ByVal hwnd As Long, _
       ByVal wMsg As Long, _
       ByVal wParam As Long, _
       ByVal lParam As Long) As Long
