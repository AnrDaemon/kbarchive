SYMPTOMS
========

Word may be unable to automatically recover your document after Word shut down
unexpectedly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur when any of the following conditions are true:

 - An AutoRecover file has not been created yet.

   By default, an AutoRecover file will not be saved until ten minutes after you
   start work on it. After ten minutes, the AutoRecover file is created. If a
   failure shuts down Word prematurely, Word will use the AutoRecover file to
   recover the document.

   -or-

 - An AutoRecover file is deleted after the document has been saved.

   A new AutoRecover file is not created until after the next AutoRecover
   duration (by default: ten minutes after you start working on the document).

   -or-

 - The document was closed and changes were not saved.

   Once a document has been closed, the AutoRecover file is deleted. There is no
   way to recover the document once the file has been closed and changes were
   not saved.

WORKAROUND
==========

To change the AutoRecover Save duration, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Save tab.

2. In the "Save AutoRecover Info Every" box, change the number to the desired
   time interval between AutoRecover saves, and click OK.

NOTE: AutoRecover is not a substitute for saving your document. When you use
AutoRecover, Word creates a temporary file to recover your document if Word
shuts down unexpectedly. You must still save your document in order to retain
your changes.
