SYMPTOMS
========

Some utilities that are included with NetWare 3.1x and NetWare 4.x do not work
with Windows NT 4.0 running Client Services or Gateway Services for NetWare.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To find out what NetWare utilities are compatible with Windows NT 4.0, perform
the following steps:

1. Go to Control Panel

2. Click on GSNW or CSNW

3. Click Help

4. Click Help Topics

5. Click Run 16-Bit Utilities and NetWare-Aware Applications

The following is the list of supported 16-bit NetWare Utilities.

MS-DOS 16-Bit NetWare Utilities
-------------------------------

You can use the Explorer or the net use command to perform the same functions as
the NetWare attach, capture, login, and logout utilities, which are not
supported and can cause failures. Use the net view command to perform the same
function as the NetWare slist utility. Like the NetWare capture command, the net
use command enables MS-DOS and Windows applications to print to a specific port.
In addition, you can use the Printers folder to connect to printer queues.
