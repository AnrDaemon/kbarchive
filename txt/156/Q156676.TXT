======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to install Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 on a computer that
uses a 80386 processor, the following error messages may occur:

   Windows NT requires an 80486 or later processor. Setup cannot continue.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 is compiled for use on computers with 80486 or
later processors and will not install on a computer with an 80386 processor.
Some computers on the Microsoft Windows NT version 3.5x Hardware Compatibility
List (HCL) contain the 80386 processor. Although the HCL for Windows NT 4.0
suggests that computers on the Windows NT 3.51 HCL are expected to run Windows
NT 4.0, any computers listed with the 80386 processor will not run Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0.
