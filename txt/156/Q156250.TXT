TITLE   :SMS: Job Status Remains Active When Sent to Entire Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you send a package to an entire site, the package is sent to all clients in
the site, regardless of the supported platforms selected in the package
properties. Because the package may not be able to run under all platforms, the
Job Status remains Active, but the Job Status Details (which displays the SMSIDs
for the clients that are not able to run the package) shows a status of None.

CAUSE
=====

Job status is only updated when the client generates a Status MIF, and that MIF
is put into the database. If a client does not run the job, a status MIF is not
created.

WORKAROUND
==========

Only send platform-sensitive packages to clients that can run them. You can send
these packages by using machine groups, query results, or individual clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
