TITLE   :Windows NT Setup Stops Responding w/HP CDR4020I on SCSI Chain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running Winnt /b on a computer that has a Hewlett-Packard (HP) CDR4020I on
a SCSI chain, Setup either stops responding at the blue screen after the first
restart, or it stops responding on the third setup disk.

CAUSE
=====

The HP CDR4020I is a Write Once Read Many (WORM) device. Windows NT does not
support WORM devices because of how they register themselves with the SCSI host
adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disconnect the power to the HP CDR4020I and restart Setup. It will bypass the
detection of the HP CDR4020I and complete the setup process.

NOTE: This problem may occur with other WORM devices. For testing purposes
disconnect the WORM and rerun Setup.

The Hewlett-Packard CDR4020I is manufactured by Hewlett-Packard Inc., a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
