SUMMARY
=======

The example in the Visual FoxPro Help under "Switching Between Local and Remote
Data at Run Time" has an error. Step 7 states the following incorrectly:

   In the Init event code for the data environment, call the data environment's
   OpenTables method:

         THIS.OpenTables

MORE INFORMATION
================

For the example to work correctly, step 7 should be changed to the following:

   In the Load event code for the form, call the data environment's OpenTables
   method:

         THISFORM.Dataenvironment.OpenTables

You must also change step 8, which states the following incorrectly:

   In the Init event code for the cursor, set the CursorSource property to the
   appropriate view, based on the setting of the user-defined form property.

   For example, the following code checks the form property and accordingly sets
   the CursorSource to a remote or local view:

         IF THISFORM.UseRemote = .T.
            THIS.CursorSource = RemoteView
         ELSE
            THIS.CursorSource = LocalView
         ENDIF

Change step 8 to the following:

   In the OpenTables method code for the data environment, set the CursorSource
   property of the cursor to the appropriate view, based on the setting of the
   user-defined form property.

   For example, the following code checks the form property and accordingly sets
   the CursorSource to a remote or local view:

         IF THISFORM.UseRemote = .T.
            THIS.Cursor1.CursorSource = RemoteView
         ELSE
            THIS.Cursor1.CursorSource = LocalView
         ENDIF

NOTE: The topic "Switching Between Local and Remote Data at Run Time" does not
appear in the Visual FoxPro 5.0 Help.
