TITLE   :XADM: ISINTEG Reports Errors on Replicated NNTP News Folders
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When replicating NNTP newsgroup folders from a computer running an newer version
of Microsoft Exchange Server to a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server
4.0, ISINTEG may report warnings when run on the public store of the computer
running Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0. The warnings look similar to the
following:

   ISINTEG -pub may report mismatches in the following properties:
   6696000B
   6697000B
   66A584B0
   66A60102
   66A60102

CAUSE
=====

NNTP newsgroup properties that get replicated with the folder to a computer
running Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 are not recognized by ISINTEG, and
therefore cause ISINTEG to generate warnings.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With the hotfix,
ISINTEG was changed to recognize the new NNTP newsgroup properties that can be
replicated to a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
