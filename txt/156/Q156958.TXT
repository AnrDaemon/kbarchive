TITLE   :Serial Service Won't Stop with Serial Printer Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a serial printer is installed on Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0
workstation or server, the serial service cannot be stopped, even when there are
no jobs being printed.

CAUSE
=====

The spooler design assumes that it exclusively holds a port when a printer is
connected and a print queue is created. The design does not allow for other
applications to do bidirectional communication with devices.


RESOLUTION
==========

A new version of Localmon.dll has been developed that allows the serial service
to be stopped, even when a serial printer is attached. Once the serial service
is stopped, other applications can access the port. This version of Localmon.dll
is not needed in most environments.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
