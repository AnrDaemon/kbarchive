TITLE   :BUG: Execute SQL Toolbar Button Not Disabled with Focus Change
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDebug kbEEdition kbSQL kbVC kbSQLProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2

SYMPTOMS
========

The "Execute SQL" button on the database toolbar is not always disabled when the
focus changes to a non-stored-procedure window.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the button is clicked when the current window is not a stored-procedure
window, the stored procedure or ad-hoc query in the window that had focus last
gets executed. To avoid any undesirable effects as a result, make sure the
desired stored-procedure window has focus prior to executing.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
