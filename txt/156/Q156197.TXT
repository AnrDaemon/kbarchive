 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run setup for your custom Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition (ODE)
application or Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) application, you may
receive the following error message when you place the second disk into your
disk drive:

   Insert the disk labeled:

   '<Your Application Name> Setup: Disk2' into Drive A:

CAUSE
=====

You copied your Disks folders to drive A without first opening each folder and
highlighting all the files in the folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you copy the files from the Disks folder, make sure you open the folders
and highlight all of the files in each folder before you try to copy them to the
floppy disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Windows Explorer, locate the folder that has your disk images. The default
   name for this folder is Disks.

2. Open the folder so that it displays all your disk images. These should be
   named Disk1, Disk2, Disk3, and so on.

3. Highlight the Disk1 folder, and drag it to drive A to copy the contents of
   the folder to drive A.

4. Repeat step 3 for all of the folders.

5. Start Setup for your custom application.

6. After Setup has processed Disk1, it prompts you for Disk2.

7. Place Disk2 into the disk drive. Note that after reading Disk2, Setup
   continues to prompt you for it, even though it is in the disk drive.
