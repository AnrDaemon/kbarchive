TITLE   :PRB: NULL and .NULL. Are Not Interchangeable in Properties
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 5.0, when assigning a null value to a property in the
Properties window, you need to use .NULL. instead of NULL. The values are not
interchangeable when used in a property in the Properties window.

CAUSE
=====

In the Properties window, you do not have to enter quotes to enter a string. The
text NULL entered without the quotes is interpreted as the string 'NULL' instead
of the actual .NULL. value.

WORKAROUND
==========

You need to enter the string as .NULL. in the Properties window.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

At times, you may wonder why you can enter the following in the Command window
and get the expected result:

      X=NULL
      ?ISNULL(X)   <-- .T. is return

However, ISNULL() evaluates as .F. instead of .T. when a NULL value, without the
period on both ends, is assigned to a property in the Properties window.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Create a new property named NullProperty.

3. In the Properties window, assign NULL to NullProperty property (that is,
   without periods before and after NULL).

4. Put the following in the form Init:

         ?ISNULL(THIS.NullProperty)

5. Run the form.

Visual FoxPro returns .F.
