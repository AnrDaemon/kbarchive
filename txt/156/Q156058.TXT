PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error occurs when attempting to set the PageCount property of a
PageFrame control to a value greater than 99:

   "Expression evaluates to an illegal value"

CAUSE
=====

Where Microsoft Visual FoxPro versions 3.0 and 3.0b allowed a PageFrame control
to have more than 99 pages, Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 5.0 and 6.0 only
allow a maximum of 99 pages in a PageFrame control.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
