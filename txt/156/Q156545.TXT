SUMMARY
=======

To set up a secondary Microsoft Mail proxy address for Microsoft Mail users to
send mail to:

1. In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, bring up the
   properties of the mailbox you want a to add a new proxy address for.

2. Click the "E-mail Addresses" tab.

3. Click New and click Microsoft Mail Address.

4. Enter the information requested and apply.

   This new proxy address must now be defined as an external postoffice on all
   Microsoft Mail Postoffices that are indirect via the Microsoft Mail Connector
   Interchange Connector postoffice.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Example:

Bob needs a secondary proxy address. So we give Bob a new proxy address with his
old NET/PO: OLDNET/OLDPO/BOB. Now Bob has two MS-type addresses:

   MS:ORG/SITE/BOB
   MS:OLDNET/OLDPO/BOB

Now you need to go to the Microsoft Mail server and use the Microsoft Exchange
Server Administrator program to create a new postoffice definition for
OLDNET/OLDPO as indirect via ORG/SITE. This will allow Microsoft Mail users to
mail to this address.

NOTE: Exchange users will receive non-delivery reports (NDRs) when sending mail
messages to this address. This procedure only allows foreign mail systems to use
the second proxy address.
