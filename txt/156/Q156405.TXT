TITLE   :Cannot Administrate the Microsoft Index Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

KEYWORDS:kbenv kbOSWin2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 1.0 
 - Indexing Service 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to administrate Microsoft Index Server running with Microsoft
Internet Information Server (IIS) version 2.0, you may see the following error
message with Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0:

   Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site
   http://<server>/srchadm/admin.htm

   The requested header was not found.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the Index Server only allows Administrative accounts and the System
account access to the administrative functions of the server. If you only have
Allow Anonymous selected in the Microsoft Internet Service Manager Password
Authentication, any user is denied access, and the user will get the above error
message.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check either Basic (Clear Text) or Microsoft Windows NT Challenge/Response
authentication under the Microsoft Internet Service Manager Password
Authentication. This will allow users to use any browser for Index Server
administration.
