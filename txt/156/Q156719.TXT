TITLE   :XCLN: Mac Client Doesn't Handle MacBinary Type I Attachments
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running a Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client and receive a message
with attachments that are in MacBinary I format, the following error will be
displayed when you open the message:

   /!\ Can't get the time stamp of MacintoshHD:System Folder:
   Exchange Temporary Items:Attachment Name.
   Microsoft Exchange will assume it is dirty. <OK>

It will be followed by:

   /!\The application associated with this attachment could not be started.
   Attachment Name (System Error = -43) <OK>

and then when you close the message:

   [Attachment Name] - has actual attachment name
   /!\The temporary file has disappeared. Changes could not be saved.
   <OK>

CAUSE
=====

Currently, the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client does not support attachments
in MacBinary I format

WORKAROUND
==========

Originators should send you messages using any encoding other than MacBinary I.

Note: The Macintosh Client does support the MacBinary II format.

STATUS
======

version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
