TITLE   :Index Server Will Not Index Virtual Directories
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0; :
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbOSWin2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 1.0 
 - Indexing Service 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Index Server will not index a virtual root. The queries will not hit
any documents on that virtual root, and the server statistics will show that no
indexing has occurred on that virtual root.

In the event viewer, you may see the following error message:

   Cannot logon to <domain name>\<user name> because of error 87.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Index Server uses the complete <domain name\user name> to access
the files to be indexed. If the <domain name\user name> is entered
incorrectly, the indexing operation will fail with the above error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the following:

1. The domain name and user name are separated with a backslash "\" not forward
   slash "/". For example,

      DOMAIN/user is wrong. (forward slash)

      DOMAIN\user is correct. (backslash)
 

2. The domain is assigned along with the user name:

      northamerica\user1 (domain name\username)
 

   If the user name is by itself, Index Server will not function properly.

3. The password is correct.

4. The account has interactive logon privileges on the target computer.
