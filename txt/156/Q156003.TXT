PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0a,4.0c,7.0,97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install the Internet Assistant for Microsoft PowerPoint on a
computer that has PowerPoint 4.0 or PowerPoint 97 installed, but not PowerPoint
95, you may receive the following error message:

   Error: You don't have Visual Basic add-ins installed with PowerPoint. Please
   run PowerPoint setup

CAUSE
=====

PowerPoint 95 is designed to accept add-in products written in Microsoft Visual
Basic. The setup program for the Internet Assistant checks the Windows Registry
to see if that add-in support has been installed. If PowerPoint 95 has not been
installed, the proper information is not written to the Windows Registry.

You may also receive this error if you install PowerPoint 95, but you choose the
Laptop (minimum) installation option. The Laptop installation does not install
the Visual Basic add-in support.

PowerPoint 97 has this ability and does not need to have the Internet Assistant
installed to provide this service. It can be accessed from the File menu.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have PowerPoint 4.0 and you want to use the Internet Assistant, you must
upgrade to PowerPoint 95. Furthermore, when you install PowerPoint 95, you
should not choose the Laptop (minimum) installation.

If you have already installed PowerPoint 95 with the Laptop installation, use
PowerPoint Setup to remove PowerPoint. Then, reinstall it using the Typical or
Custom/Complete installation choices.
