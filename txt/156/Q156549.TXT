TITLE   :FIX: Click Event of a List Box Fires Twice
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0

KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 3.0 and 3.0b for Windows, when you click on an item in a list
box, the Click event fires and runs the code in the Click event. If the item in
the List box is already highlighted and the item is clicked again, the code in
the Click event runs twice.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the desired effect is to click on an item and have the Click event fire once
and not fire again until another item is chosen, create a form as follows:

1. Create a form and place a list box on it.

2. While the list box is highlighted, set the RowSourceType property to Value in
   the Properties box.

3. In the RowSource property, type the following values:

         AAA, BBB, CCC, DDD

4. In the Click event of the list box, type the following code:

         WAIT WINDOW "List box, Click event"

   NOTE: If you run the form at this point, the problem described above occurs.

5. Modify the form and create a custom property for the form by clicking New
   Property on the Form menu. In the New Property box type "OneClick" (without
   the quotation marks).

6. In the Init event of the form, type "ThisForm.OneClick = X " (without the
   quotation marks).

7. In the Click event of the list box change the current code with the
   following:

         IF This.DisplayValue != ThisForm.OneClick
            WAIT WINDOW "List box, Click event"
            ThisForm.OneClick = This.DisplayValue
         ENDIF

   If an item is selected and the Click event needs to be fired regardless of it
   being previously highlighted, then the code is going to be fired twice. There
   is no workaround for this case.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro
version 5.0 for Windows.
