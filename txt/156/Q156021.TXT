SUMMARY
=======

The FillColor and BackColor properties provide control over the colors of an
object. The FillColor property controls the pen color that fills an object and
works in conjunction with the FillStyle property. Because the FillStyle property
is transparent by default, the effects of changing the FillColor property may
not appear immediately. By changing the FillStyle property to Solid or to
another fill pattern, the effects of the FillColor property become apparent.

The BackColor property colors areas of the shape that the FillColor property
leaves unchanged. For example, if the FillColor property is set to blue and the
FillStyle property is set to 3 - Vertical Lines, the BackColor property fills in
areas between the vertical blue lines. However, if the BackStyle property is set
to Transparent, the BackColor property is ignored.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To specify a shape with a blue background and red stripes, perform the following
steps:

1. Create a form.

2. Place a shape on the form using the Form Controls toolbar.

   BackColor = 0,0,255
