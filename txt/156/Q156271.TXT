SUMMARY
=======

An installation script is required for "Run Command on Workstation" packages, if
the executable file specified in the Package Command Line terminates after
calling a second executable file that relies on accessing the package share
location to continue.

Many applications run a setup program, and the original executable (such as
Setup.exe) does not keep running throughout the duration of setup. When creating
a "Run Command on Workstation" package, the executable file to run is specified.
When the workstation receives that package, and the Package Command Manager
(PCM) goes to run it, PCM does a NET USE to the package share location. As soon
as the original executable file is finished running, PCM deletes the share. If
the executable file spawned another executable file before it closed, the second
application will fail if it relies on the source share. The error messages that
may result from this problem vary from application to application. PCM will
report in the Pcmwin.log file that the package ran successfully.

There may or may not be error messages when the installation fails, depending on
the setup application. The following are examples of common error messages or
problems that may be encountered:

   Insert Disk 16 in Drive N:

   Unable to read from Drive N:

   Disk Error Drive/on Device N:

   Error reading Drive N

   Error opening file XXX

   Error in script line 123 - cannot open media script file

Buttons or windows may be blank or not drawn correctly

The system stops responding

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - If the application to be installed is an MS-DOS-based application, or a
   Windows-based application on a client computer running Windows NT, it may be
   possible to create a batch file containing the command for the setup
   executable file, and then use the batch file as the command line when
   creating the package.

 - If the application is a 16-bit application for a computer running Windows
   3.1, Windows NT, or Windows 95, use Execute.exe to run a two- phase setup
   program under the PCM program. Execute.exe is provided with the Systems
   Management Server 1.2 Resource Kit, and requires a basic understanding of
   Visual C++.

 - Copy the source files to the local hard drive, before launching setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSTest is not the only option for writing an installation script for "Run
Command on Workstation" packages. There are other options, such as using
InstallShield or WINInstall, Visual Basic, C, or even Visual Test (for client
computers running Windows NT only).

NOTE: If the entire setup program runs from a single executable file (many
programs do), it is not necessary to write an installation script at all.

The following are some third-party applications that can be used to write an
installation script:

 - MSTest by Microsoft Corporation

 - Visual Test by Microsoft Corporation

 - InstallShield by Installshield Corporation

 - WINInstall by Seagate (formerly OnDemand Software)

 - WinBatch by Wilson WindowWare

 - LAN Script by ABC Systems

 - Wise Solutions, Inc.
