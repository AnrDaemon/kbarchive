TITLE   :Setting Up Virtual Directory May Cause "Logon Failure" ErrMsg
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WinNT:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up Internet Information Server (IIS) version 2.0 with a virtual
directory to a NetWare server, you may receive the following error message:

   Logon failure: unknown user or password.

CAUSE
=====

Internet Information Server uses the username and password in the Virtual
Directory Configuration dialog box to connect to the NetWare server. IIS assumes
this is a valid account on both the NetWare server and the Windows NT Server
computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use User Manager for domains to assure that the account used to access
the NetWare server is valid on both the NetWare server and in the Windows NT
domain local database. If the account is a domain user, then remember to use the
<domain name>\<username> nomenclature when you enter the user name.

Additional query words: log on
