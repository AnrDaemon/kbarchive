TITLE   :SMS: Standalone Servers Report to Site Server Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory kbSCMan smsinv smssiteconfigman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Any standalone computers running Windows NT Server that belong to a second tier
domain will report their inventory to the Systems Management Server site
server's domain instead of to their own domain if both of the following
conditions are true:

 - The Systems Management Server sites have two or more Windows NT Server
   domains.

-and-

 - The domain is configured to automatically detect all servers.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server Site Configuration Manager is giving the wrong
domain to the client set up during the initial installation of the server
through the "Auto-detect all servers" option. Site Configuration Manager always
specifies the site server's domain, so that the logon server that is used is
from the site server's domain. This results in an Sms.ini file created on the
client containing the site server domain instead of its own domain.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.


A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should
be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information.
