TITLE   :BUG: MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN Does Not Reset BackColor Property
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbui kbvfp kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN command to reset the value of the BackColor
property of the _SCREEN system variable does not work.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this by issuing the following command:

      _SCREEN.ResetToDefault('BackColor')

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to the Help file in Visual FoxPro 5.0, to return the main Visual
FoxPro window to its startup configuration, issue the MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN
command without any additional clauses. When you do so, it visually resets the
_SCREEN BackColor property to the startup color, which is white, but the value
of the BackColor property still has the previous value.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

In the Command window, issue the following commands:

      _SCREEN.BackColor = RGB(192,192,192)
      ? _SCREEN.BackColor    && The value of BackColor is 12632256.
      MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN
      ? _SCREEN.BackColor

_SCREEN.BackColor changes to white visually, but the value of the BackColor
property is still 12632256.

Now issue these commands in the Command window:

      _SCREEN.ResetToDefault('BackColor')
      ? _SCREEN.BackColor

The BackColor property is now 16777215 (which is white).
