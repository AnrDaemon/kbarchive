DOCUMENT:Q156643  14-DEC-1999  [foxpro]
TITLE   :PRB: Company Name Does Not Appear in Version Dialog
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The company name typed in the Project Information dialog does not appear after
choosing Company Name from the list box in the EXE Version dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

These are two independent pieces of information. Visual FoxPro does not tie them
together. The Project Information window provides a way to enter information
about a project (.PJX) file and its contents. The EXE version dialog relates to
the executable file. A developer may want to place different information in
these two dialogs.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program called Test that contains a Wait Window command.

2. Create a project called Test and add the program Test to it.

3. Click the Project menu pad and choose Project Info.

4. In the Company field, type "Microsoft" (without the quotation marks) and
   click the OK button.

5. Choose Build from the Project Manager and click Version. In the Version
   Information section, click Company Name in the list box. No company name
   appears in the Value box.
