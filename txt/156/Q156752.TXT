KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A graph created with the Graph Wizard may appear in black and white while the
legend appears in color.

CAUSE
=====

When a graph contains a large number of data points, the graph output will
appear in black and white.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a graph contains a very large number of data points, the Graph Wizard is
unable to display the multitude of data items in color. The legend reflects the
colors of the data series of the graph. Because there are fewer data series
elements than individual data points, the legend appears in color.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start the Graph Wizard and choose the Orders table from the testdata database
   located in the \Samples\Data folder.

2. Select the following fields for the graph and choose Next:

   Freight, Order_amt, Order_dsc, Order_net, and Emp_id.

3. Place Emp_id in the Axis area and place Freight, Order_amt, Order_dsc, and
   Order_net in the Data Series area. Choose Next.

4. On the top row, select the bar graph second from the right. Choose Finish.

5. Select the following options: "Add a legend to the graph," "Save graph to a
   table," and "Show null values." Choose Finish, and give the table a name.

6. Choose Yes when a warning message appears stating:

   You have over 100 records to graph. The graph may be crowded and hard to read.
   Do you want to prepare the graph anyway?

7. Note that the graph appears in black and white while the legend has color.
