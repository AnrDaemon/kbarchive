TITLE   :HOWTO: Use the DataToClip Method
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can easily send the contents of a table or a portion of the contents of a
table, cursor, or view to the Clipboard with the DataToClip() method.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the table open, issue this command in the Command window:

      _VFP.DataToClip()

You can then paste the records that have been copied to the Clipboard into a
document or worksheet. The online documentation has an example of using the
DataToClip method from an Excel module that is using FoxPro as an OLE server.
This code needs some modification to run. The Help file and the Online
Documentation give the following syntax:

   DataToClip([nWorkArea | cTableAlias]|[, nRecords] [, nClipFormat])

If the nClipFormat property is 1, columns are space-delimited. If the nClipFormat
property is 3, the columns are delimited with tabs (which is nice for creating
tables in Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel). The default is to copy all
records from the currently selected work area, so be sure to specify nRecords if
it is a table with a large number of records.

If you would like to copy only some fields or if you want records based on some
criteria, issue a SELECT - SQL command first and use the DataToClip method on
the cursor created.

One limitation is that the DataToClip method does not handle .NULL. field values.
It may or may not copy the record containing the .NULL. value, or other records
may be missing.
