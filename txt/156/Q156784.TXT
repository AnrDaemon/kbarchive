OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

SYMPTOMS
========


A Systems Management Server shared application started with Appstart.exe
(Appsta32.exe) may have problems where dependencies exist on environment
variables within the new process. If the current environment variable size is
greater than 1,146 bytes, the environment variables of the new process can
become corrupt. This can cause problems for applications that depend on the
environment variables.

CAUSE
=====

A problem exists in the 32-bit APPSTART component of SMS which causes the new
environment passed to a new PGC application process to be corrupted.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining
the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
