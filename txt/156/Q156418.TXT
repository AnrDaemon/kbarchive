TITLE   :SMS: Standalone Servers Report to Site Server Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork kbInventory kbSCMan smsinv smssiteconfigman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When Systems Management Server sites have two or more Windows NT domains, and
the domain is configured to auto-detect all servers, any Windows NT standalone
servers that belong to a second tier domain will report their inventory to the
Systems Management Server site server's domain, rather than their own domain.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server Site Configuration Manager is giving the wrong
domain to the client set up during the initial installation of the server
through the auto-detect all servers option. Site Configuration Manager always
specifies the site server's domain, so that the logon server that is used is
from the site server's domain. This results in an Sms.ini file containing the
site server domain (instead of its own domain) being created on the client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
