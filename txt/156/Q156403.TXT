PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Macintosh inventory records do not display the network adapter card hardware
address or IP address of a Macintosh client running Macintosh operating system
version 7.5.3 with Macintosh Open Transport 1.0 or 1.1.

CAUSE
=====

Macintosh Open Transport is installed on Apple Power Macintoshes to support PCI
network adapters and to support streams-based protocols such as Macintosh
TCP/IP. With the introduction of Macintosh Open Transport, the method the
Systems Management Server InvMac component uses to determine the network adapter
card address and the TCP/IP address is no longer available.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. A supported fix is now available for SMS 1.2, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack
that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
