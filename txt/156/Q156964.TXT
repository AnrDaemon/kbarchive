   TITLE : How to Re-create Default Icons Deleted from Desktop

If you need to reinstall the program, you can choose one of the following options
to reinstall Internet Explorer 2.0:

 - Right-click the Iexplore.inf file located in the %SystemRoot%\Inf folder, and
   then click Install.

 - Run Windows NT Setup and perform an Upgrade installation over the top of the
   existing installation.

 - Run the Setup for Internet Explorer 2.0 for Windows NT 3.51. This will
   install it on Windows NT 4.0. You can find a copy of this on the Microsoft
   FTP server at: ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/msdownload/ie2/winnt/

Replacing the Internet Explorer after it has been removed can also be done by
going to %systemroot%\inf\iexplorer.inf, right click on the inf and select
install. It will require the NT Disk but will reinstall just Internet Explorer
2.0. This will work even if the system has been updated to a 3.x version of
Internet Explorer and you need access to the World Wide Web to download another
copy of Internet Explorer.
