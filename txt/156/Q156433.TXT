SYMPTOMS
========

An administrator is not allowed to update or modify user system variables (for
example, SET PATH=TEMP) on an existing mandatory profile.

CAUSE
=====

When an administrator attempts to add or modify a mandatory profile's system
variable(s), the system updates the administrator's profile and not the
mandatory profile.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

1. The administrator must rename the mandatory profile (.man) to a user profile
   (.usr).

2. Assign the user profile (.usr) to an administrator.

3. Log off and log on as the administrator that is using the profile.

4. Configure the profile as desired and save the profile as a user profile
   (.usr).

5. Rename the user profile (.usr) to a mandatory profile (.man).

6. Assign the updated profile back to the user/group.

-or-

Create a new mandatory profile through User Profile Editor with the desired
configuration.
