DOCUMENT:Q156187  10-AUG-2001  [winnt]
TITLE   :Cannot Locate Readme.doc on MSDN Compact Disc
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open Readme.doc on the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)
compact disc that contains Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0, you may not be able
to open the file as the documentation suggests.

CAUSE
=====

The documentation shipped with the MSDN compact disc set that includes Microsoft
Windows NT version 4.0 incorrectly refers to a Readme.doc file in the root
directory that does not exist.

RESOLUTION
==========

The MSDN documentation incorrectly states the filename and location of the
preinstallation notes for Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0. The documentation
should reference Setup.txt (uncompressed) in the directory corresponding to the
architecture being used (for example, I386 for Intel-based hardware).

Setup.txt notes preinstallation issues specific to hardware, firmware, and
general installation topics of Microsoft Windows NT.

You can find supplemental
(http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/supplemental) release
notes in Readme.wri, Network.wri, and Printer.wri. Windows NT Setup installs
Readme.wri in the following directory:

   <System Root>\System32

Network.wri and Printer.wri can be found in the system root directory after
installation.

The books and manuals for Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0, including the Start
Here manual, are organized by chapter as uncompressed .doc files and can be
found in the Support\Books directory on the compact disc.
