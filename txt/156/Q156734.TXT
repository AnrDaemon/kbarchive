SYMPTOMS

When you attempt to import a Directory Import file using the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program, you may encounter the following error:

   The attribute Member of is not directly importable.

In addition, in the Windows NT Event Viewer, you will find the following event
logged by MSExchangeDSImp:

   Event ID: 154
   The attribute Member of is not directly importable.

SUMMARY
=======

The import file field Member Of is not a valid import field. It can only be
exported from Microsoft Exchange.

WORKAROUND
==========

When using the import function of Exchange Administrator to add mailboxes to a
Distribution List, use one of the following two options:

1. Create an import file with a list of DL's and put the list of users for that
   DL in the Members field.

2. Create an import file with a list of mailboxes and put the list of DL's that
   each mailbox should belong to in a field titled Members instead of Member Of.
