TITLE   :Boot Loader Screen Keeps Repeating During Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, during the GUI-mode portion of
Windows NT Setup, the boot loader screen counts down from the default 5 seconds
to 0, the screen goes black, and then the boot loader screen reappears and
cycles through this process indefinitely.

CAUSE
=====

The boot drive may be infected with a boot-sector virus.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a reputable third-party virus scanning product to detect and clean the boot
sector of the system drive. Do not use FDISK /MBR as some boot sector viruses
may permanently damage the boot sector when removed in this manner.


Additional query words: 4.00 loop load
