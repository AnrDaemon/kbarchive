SUMMARY
=======

To determine whether you have the domestic or international version of Internet
Information Server (IIS), you can view the version information of the Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) security provider file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The domestic versions of IIS provide a higher level of data encryption than the
international versions and are restricted from export. In IIS 1.0, the SSL
provider file is Sslsspi.dll; in IIS 2.0 it is the Schannel.dll file. These
files are located in the %Systemroot%\System32 directory.

To view the version information under Windows NT 3.51:

1. Open File Manager.

2. Select the appropriate .dll file in File Manager.

3. Press ALT+ENTER.

4. Select File Information.

To View the version information under Windows NT 4.0:

1. Right-click the appropriate .dll file.

2. Click Properties.

3. Select Version.

The domestic version will read SSL Security Provider (Domestic Use Only); the
international version simply reads "SSL Security Provider."
