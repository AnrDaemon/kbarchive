 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setting the BorderWidth property to 0 for a Shape control does not make the
border of the Shape control disappear.

same color as the FillColor property for the Shape object.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

Setting the BorderWidth property to 0 in Visual FoxPro 3.0 and 3.0b works as
expected. This only appears to be a problem in Visual FoxPro 5.0.

2. Add a Shape control to the form.

3. In the Properties window, change the BorderWidth property of the Shape
   control to 0.

   The border of the Shape control still appears in the form.
