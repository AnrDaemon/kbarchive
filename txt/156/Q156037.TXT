The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro requires that ActiveX Controls support a minimum set of interfaces
as defined in the document "OLE Control and Container Guidelines," version 1.1.

For more information on the OLE Control and Container Guidelines and ActiveX
technology, see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q137555 OLE Controls and Control Containers Guidelines

   Q154544 Description of ActiveX Technologies

This information is also available on MSDN and at the OLE Developers Web Site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The interfaces required by Visual FoxPro are those defined in the OLE Control
and Container Guidelines document, version 1.1. Visual FoxPro 3.0 supports
controls defined as Simple Controls. Visual FoxPro version 5.0 supports the
following categories of controls: Simple Controls, Simple Frame Controls, and
Simple Data Bound Controls.

Visual FoxPro does not support and may not function correctly with controls that
do not meet these guidelines. This may include new ActiveX controls designed
specifically for the Internet. These controls generally include a very minimum
set of interfaces.

There is no mechanism provided by OLE that allows Visual FoxPro to verify whether
a control meets these Guidelines or to filter the list of controls.

When version 5.0 of Visual FoxPro shipped, a new standard was being developed to
allow ActiveX controls to register that they required one or more specific
categories of features. This standard will allow ActiveX control containers to
eliminate controls that require known, unsupported categories. These registry
entries are not recognized by Visual FoxPro 5.0.

Additional query words: SimpleFrame DataBound Standards
