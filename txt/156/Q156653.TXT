TITLE   :Disabling the Installation of IE 2.0 During Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, Internet Explorer (IE) 2.0 for Windows NT 4.0 is installed and
placed on the desktop.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The method of disabling the installation of IE 2.0 works with a normal network
installation of Windows NT or an Unattended installation. To enable the
installation of IE 2.0 again, simply remove the semicolon from the line.

WARNING: Incorrect modifications to INF files can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from modifications of INF files can
be solved. Use this method at your own risk.

To disable the installation of Internet Explorer 2.0 during setup, the
Iexplore.inf entry in Syssetup.inf needs to be commented or deleted.

By default Syssetup.inf is compressed on the Windows NT 4.0 CD.

1. Copy the I386 directory from the Windows NT 4.0 CD to a hard disk drive.

2. Expand the Syssetup.in_ to Syssetup.inf

   NOTE: Expand.exe must be run from within Windows NT, that is, expand
   Syssetup.in_ to Syssetup.inf

3. Rename Syssetup.in_ to Syssetup.old. By default, Setup will use the
   compressed version if both exist.

4. Open Syssetup.inf and search for Iexplore.inf and insert a semicolon in front
   of Iexplore.inf.

The change should look like this:

[Infs.Always]
; iexplore.inf,DefaultInstall
