TITLE   :XCLN: Unread Messages Might not be Displayed in Bold
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible for unread message headers to not be displayed in Bold in the
Microsoft Exchange client. This can be caused by the font that is selected to
display message headers in the Inbox.

NOTE: The unread message count still displays correctly on the Microsoft Exchange
status bar.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, Microsoft Exchange will use MS Sans Serif 8pt for message headers.
If that has been changed, the aforementioned symptoms might occur. The steps
below discuss how to modify the system settings. If you choose this method, the
icon font is changed for all desktop icons, not just Microsoft Exchange client
Inbox headers:

1. Click the Start button, click Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Display icon.

   NOTE: You can skip steps 1 and 2 if you click the desktop with the right
   (secondary) mouse button and then click Properties.

3. Click the Appearance tab.

4. On the Item menu, click Icon.

5. On the Font menu, select a different font, and then click OK.
