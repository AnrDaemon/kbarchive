TITLE   :Low Free Conventional Memory with OEM Service Release 2
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2), there may not be enough free
conventional memory.

CAUSE
=====

Buffers are being loaded into conventional memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the following lines to the Config.sys file in the root folder of the boot
drive, and then restart your computer:

   DOS=HIGH,UMB
   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS
   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\SETVER.EXE
   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\IFSHLP.SYS
   BUFFERS=13

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a "buffers=" value is not specified in the Config.sys file, buffers are set
to 23. Buffers are loaded into the High Memory Area (HMA) if space allows.
Io.sys and Msdos.sys are also normally loaded into the HMA, leaving insufficient
room to store 23 buffers. The buffers are therefore loaded into conventional
memory, creating the low memory situation.
