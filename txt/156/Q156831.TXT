SUMMARY
=======

To shoot the ball from the free throw line, you need to hold the shoot button
down, or tap it several times. In game play each time you tap the shoot button
the player pump fakes, but from the free throw line there is no pump fake and
the player will not release the ball.

If you release the shoot button at just the right moment, the player shoots the
ball. The shot ranges for players in Full Court Press vary by player skill
level. The shot range for good shooters is much larger than the shot range for
bad shooters, and therefore gives you a much greater margin for error.
