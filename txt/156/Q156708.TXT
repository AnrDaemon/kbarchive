TITLE   :XADM: Rule Forces CPU Usage Above 90%, Stops Message Delivery
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Foreign system Read Receipts, when delivered by the Microsoft Exchange Message
Transfer Agent (MTA) and then processed by a Microsoft Exchange Inbox rule that
moves the message to the sent mail folder, can cause the Microsoft Exchange
Information Store (IS) service to use 90-100% of the CPU. The MTA will then fail
to deliver any further messages to the IS. The IS service cannot be stopped once
this problem occurs and a reboot of the Microsoft Exchange Server computer is
required.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mail messages will still be able to be sent out from the Microsoft Exchange
Server and users will still be able to send and receive messages from other
users on the same Microsoft Exchange Server but all messages coming into the
Microsoft Exchange Server will be held up in the MTA Private Information Store
queue.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
