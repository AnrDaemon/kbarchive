The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Offline views in Visual FoxPro allow you to work with a selected amount of data
while it is disconnected from the server. Then you can reconnect to the server
and update the data.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With offline views, you can work with data offline, meaning the data is no
longer connected to the server. This allows you to take your work on the road or
to save a connection to the server by working with the data locally.

You can also take your data to another site with offline views. Once you have
created an offline view (using the CREATEOFFLINE function), you can copy the
necessary files to a disk or to a laptop and be on your way.

If you do not want to tie up a connection to the server, you can create an
offline view and do the work locally, somewhat simulating a peer-to-peer
network. Once you have finished the work, you can use the offline view's ONLINE
clause and update the data on the server.
