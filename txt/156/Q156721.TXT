TITLE   :XCLN: Double-Clicking an Attachment Might Open New Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click on a file attachment in the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh
client, it might open a new message and insert the attachment into the new
message.

CAUSE
=====

This will occur if the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client does not recognize
the file attachment. This happens when the attachment does not have a Mac
creator or type, or there is no mapping from the file extension, creator, or
type. The unrecognized file attachment will be stamped with a creator of 'EXCH'
and a type of 'XCAT' and this will cause the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client
to open a new message.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, use a program such as ResEdit or the shareware Snitch
More Info plug-in to reset the creator to '----' and the type to '????' on all
saved attachments. This will prevent the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client
from starting when these documents are clicked.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   " SERVPACK" (without the quotation marks)


MORE INFORMATION
================

This fix corrects the reported problems for all attachments received after this
version of the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client is installed. It will not fix
this problem for attachments received and saved prior to the installation of
this fix.
