TITLE   :Disabling Access to Network Resources Using System Policies
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The default user icon in System Policy Editor lets you hide network resources in
Network Neighborhood or even completely hide the Network Neighborhood itself
(Default User\Shell\Restrictions\Hide Network Neighborhood).

However, users can still browse network resources from Windows Explorer and My
Computer using the Map Network Drive icon in addition to the NET VIEW and NET
USE commands issued from the command prompt.

WORKAROUND
==========

In My Computer, select the "Hide drives in My Computer" check box under Default
User\Shell\Restrictions\Hide Drives. Although the Map Network Drive button
continues to show a list of servers, logical network drives are not visible in
Windows Explorer, My Computer, or at the MS-DOS prompt.

Attempts to establish new logical drive connections from the command prompt
appear to work. A NET USE to a network resource completes with the message
"Command completed successfully." Attempts to access the resource, however, fail
with an error message: "The device is not ready."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
