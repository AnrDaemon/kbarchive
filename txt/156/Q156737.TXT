Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add an array property to the form and name it aListItems1[9].

3. In the Load event of the form, add the following code:

      DIMENSION ThisForm.aListItems1[9]
      ThisForm.aListItems1[1]="First"
      ThisForm.aListItems1[2]="Second"
      ThisForm.aListItems1[3]="\Third"
      ThisForm.aListItems1[4]="Fourth"
      ThisForm.aListItems1[5]="Fifth"
      ThisForm.aListItems1[6]="Sixth"
      ThisForm.aListItems1[7]="Seventh"
      ThisForm.aListItems1[8]="\Eighth"
      ThisForm.aListItems1[9]="Ninth"

4. Add a TextBox to the form.

5. Add a ListBox to the form, and set the properties as follows:

      ControlSource = ThisForm.Text1.Value
      RowSourceType = 5 - Array
      RowSource = ThisForm.aListItems1

6. Save and run the form.

7. Using the keyboard arrows to move up and down in the ListBox, try to select
   the disabled items. Note that the disabled item gets selected and the value
   is displayed in the TextBox.
