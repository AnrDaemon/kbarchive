TITLE   :PRB: Unable to Reference SCX with Spaces in Filename
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a form contains spaces in its file name, you may be unable to reference the
form object created when this form is run either from program code or in the
Debug or Watch window.

RESOLUTION
==========

Successfully referencing form objects by SCX name requires replacing any space
character(s) with underscores.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a form is created by the DO FORM command, Visual FoxPro attempts to use the
filename, minus the .SCX extension, as a variable to store the object reference
for the form. If the filename contains spaces, Visual FoxPro determines that it
is not a valid variable name and transforms it into something valid by replacing
the spaces with underscores.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form by entering the following in the Command window:

      MODI FORM "X X"

2. From the File menu, choose Save, and then close the Form Designer.

3. Run the form by entering the following in the Command window:

      DO FORM  "X X"

4. In Visual FoxPro 3.0 or 3.0b, open the Debug window and type X X in the
   left-hand side. In Visual FoxPro 5.0, open the Visual FoxPro Debugger and
   type X X in the Watch window.

Following this behavior, note that:

 - You will not see (Object) next to the X X in the Debug or Watch window.

 - If the X X is replaced with X_X, the form object can be correctly referenced.
