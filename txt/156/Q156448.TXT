The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you upgrade from SourceSafe 3.x to Visual SourceSafe 4.0, all of the 8.3
files that were in mixed case are now in upper case. The case of long file names
are preserved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you noticed this change right after the upgrade, then running the 32-bit
Ddconv.exe utility dated 1/9/96 or later may resolve the problem. The Ddconv.exe
utility is available from most Microsoft download sites. It is included with the
Analyze.exe utility.

If you noticed this change some time after the upgrade, the newer Ddconv.exe may
or may not work. If it does not work, the only option is to rename the files in
Visual SourceSafe. To do this, access the File Menu and choose the Rename...
option.

REFERENCES
==========

The analyze utility can be obtained with directions in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:
