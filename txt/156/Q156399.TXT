TITLE   :XADM: JET Asserts on Heavily Used Multivalued Columns in the DS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When performing an operation in the directory (for example, adding connectors,
setting up replication, and so on) the JET may produce an assertion (if running
the debug build of Edb.dll) or possibly Dr. Watson (if running the retail
version). The assertion looks similar to the following:

   Jet Assertion Failure
   Rel. 1416.0, File bm.c, Line 1218
   (pfucbldx->ssib.pbf)->cWaitLatch > 0 &&
   (pfucbldx->ssi.pbf)->cPin > 0 &&
   (pfucbldx0>ssib.pbf)->ppibWaitLatch == (pbmfix->ppib) PID: 416, TID:
   224

CAUSE
=====

During the expunge of a back link, JET deletes the old index item and inserts
another. While inserting another item, it causes another split on the index and
a move of some items also belonging to this cleanup. Because the new page is not
wait latched, it asserts. This happens only on indexes of multivalue columns
that the DS just added and uses heavily.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With the hotfix,
JET aborts the cleanup (expunging) and retries it when it realizes that some
items were moved.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
