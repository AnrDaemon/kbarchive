TITLE   :Unable to Use Standard Program I/O in PERL Script
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are unable to use standard programming I/O methods to pass arguments and/or
data to and from external command or separate PERL Scripts that are spawned from
a parent script.

CAUSE
=====

When you spawn a script or external command from a CGI application, it is
created in a separate process. By default Microsoft Internet Information Server
(IIS) 2.0 does not create a console and does not support standard I/O
redirection between processes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, edit the registry as described below.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and locate the following registry subkey
   in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree:

      \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\Parameters

2. Click Add Value on the Edit menu.

3. Type the following:

      Value Name: CreateProcessWithNewConsole
      Data Type: REG_DWORD
      DateValue = 1

   NOTE: Creating a new console for each CGI script has serious performance
   implications and should not be done unless slower performance is acceptable.


MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information about supported registry parameters, please see the
Online documentation for IIS 2.0. Go to the product documentation link and
choose Chapter 10 from the contents page then Service Specific Registry Entries
with Common Names. Search on CreateProcessWithNewConsole.
