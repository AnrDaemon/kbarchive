TITLE   :WSAAsyncGetHostByName() Returns IP Address in Reverse Order
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0; :2.2c
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork msnets

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Winsock Applications that issue a WSAAsyncGetHostByName() against MS real mode
TCP/IP Winsock.dll receive IP address in reverse order

A Winsock application such as Internet Explorer 2.01 or Netscape 2.02 running on
Windows 3.1 with MS real mode TCP/IP stack will fail to connect a remote host
when the application issues a WSAAsyncGetHostByName() to resolve the remote host
name to IP address. For example, WSAAsyncGetHostByName() will return
"99.88.77.66" if the remote host IP address is "66.77.88.99".

CAUSE
=====

The Winsock.dll, distributed with real mode TCP/IP for LAN Manager and MS
Network Client, improperly formats the IP address.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, try to use GetHostByName() instead of the
WSAAsyncGetHostByName() call.

A work around for Internet Explorer is to put Use_Async_DNS=no in the [Services]
section of Iexplore.ini. This forces the Net_MultiGetHostByName_Async (w32net.c)
to call WS_GETHOSTBYNAME instead of WS_WSAASYNCGETHOSTBYNAME.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Network Client
3.0 and Lan Manager 2.2c.
