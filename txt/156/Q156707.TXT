TITLE   :XADM: NDR's Due to Non-Printable Characters in the DDA Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a message is received by Microsoft Exchange and the sender's address
contains a DDA Value, characters within the string might be translated by
Microsoft Exchange. This can cause the originating system to refuse to accept
replies to the sender.

CAUSE
=====

The only characters allowed in the ORName address DomainDefinedAttribute are
printable characters. However, Microsoft Exchange translates character sequences
used to indicate special characters in DDA values and sends these non-printable
characters to other email systems. For example: the character string (b) is
translated to ! and the character string (a) is translated to @.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
