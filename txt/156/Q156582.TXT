TITLE   :PRB: Opening Database Named IN.DBC as a Table Causes Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to open a .dbc file named In.dbc as a table with the USE command
causes the following error message to appear:

   Expression is not valid outside of With/EndWith.

CAUSE
=====

The USE command has an IN clause. In this case, Visual FoxPro cannot determine
whether the word "In" is a clause of the command or the file name.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following syntax successfully opens the .dbc file as a table:

      USE "In.dbc"

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In this case, the syntax of the USE command is ambiguous. The USE IN <exp>
command closes a table located in the specified work area. Since it is not clear
that "In" is a file name, FoxPro treats it like a clause of the USE command.

When FoxPro interprets the USE command, it attempts to evaluate the .dbc file as
a property. Since no such property exists, the error message appears.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Command window, type the following code:

         CREATE DATABASE In
         CLOSE DATABASE
         USE In.dbc

2. After the above error appears, click the Cancel button.

3. Type the following line in the Command window to open the database as a
   table:

         USE "In.dbc"
