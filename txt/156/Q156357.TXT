TITLE   :Windows NT Pauses During Startup with Adaptec 1542CP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an Adaptec 1542CP in a computer running Windows NT Server or
Workstation, Windows NT may pause during startup for up to 5 minutes. Event
Viewer may indicate Event Id 9 - "Device\SCSIportX did not respond within the
timeout period."

CAUSE
=====

This error can be caused by a setting in the computer's BIOS.

The setting in question may be First available interrupt and contain a numeric
value. This setting determines what IRQs are available to the computer's PCI
devices. Other BIOS manufacturers use Reserved by ISA to deny PCI devices access
to those specified interrupts.

With Plug and Play disabled on the Adaptec 1542CP (which is the desired setting
when using this controller with Windows NT), the default interrupt chosen by the
controller is IRQ 10. If any PCI devices attempt to use this IRQ (based on the
BIOS setting for available interrupts), you may experience the above symptoms.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ensure that any available interrupts are NOT equal to the IRQ setting of the
Adaptec controller. If your BIOS uses the Reserved by ISA scheme of interrupt
control, then ensure the BIOS has reserved the Adaptec's IRQ setting as Reserved
by ISA.
