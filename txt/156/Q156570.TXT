PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT, versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send Internet (SMTP) mail using the Internet Mail service in
a Microsoft Exchange client and you have Microsoft Mail with a LAN connection
configured at the same time, your message will not stay at the Outbox until you
force delivery via the Internet Mail service. Instead, you might receive a
Non-Delivery Notification (NDN) from your Microsoft Mail Postoffice or the
message will be delivered by Microsoft Mail via the configured gateway.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs when the Microsoft Mail transport has been enabled to deliver
to SMTP addresses through the mail gateway on the Microsoft Mail Server side.

WORKAROUND
==========

To keep the Microsoft Mail transport from delivering the SMTP message and let
the Internet Mail service deliver it via the Internet Service Provider, follow
these steps:

1. Double-click the Inbox icon on the desktop to start the Microsoft Exchange
   client.

2. From the Tools menu, click Services.

3. Select Microsoft Mail from Services and click Properties.

4. Select the Delivery tab and click Address Type.

5. Clear SMTP checkbox under Only Send Mail to These Address Types.
