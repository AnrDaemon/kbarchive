======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95, you
might receive the following error message:

   Your administrator must install MAPI before you can install the Exchange
   client.

After you click OK, the setup program exits.

CAUSE
=====

You are attempting to install the Microsoft Exchange client on a shared
installation of Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must install a shared version of the Microsoft Exchange client on a shared
version of Windows 95. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Login to a shared Windows 95 computer with an account that has full
   permissions to the shared Windows 95 directory.

2. Create a Microsoft Exchange network install point by running "Setup /A"
   (without the quotation marks). This will install a shared copy of the
   Microsoft Exchange client on the network share as well as update files in the
   shared Windows 95 directory.

3. Install the Microsoft Exchange client on each shared Windows 95 computer by
   running Setup from the Microsoft Exchange network install point with no
   parameters.
