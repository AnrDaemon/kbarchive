TITLE   :Basic Authentication Prompt Before NT Challenge/Response
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you select both Basic (Clear Text) and Windows NT Challenge/Response
authentication from WWW Services properties and try to access the web server
from a client logon to the Internet Information Server's domain, the web client
should use the client logon credentials from the cache. However, a Username
Password dialog box will appear on the web client.

CAUSE
=====

If you select both Basic (Clear Text) and Windows NT Challenge/Response
authentication from WWW Services properties, Internet Information Server should
try to authenticate with Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication first. If
that fails, Internet Information Server should try to authenticate with Basic
(Clear Text). However, it is a known problem that Internet Information Server
executes this sequence in reverse order.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 1.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 2.0.
