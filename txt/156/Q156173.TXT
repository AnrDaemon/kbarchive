SUMMARY
=======

The Class Browser has been updated for Visual FoxPro 5.0. It includes new
functionality. This article describes tips for using some of these new features.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following are some tips for using the new Class Browser:

 - You can right-click the Open and Add toolbar buttons to display a list of the
   last eight files that were opened in the Class Browser and that are not
   currently displayed in the active Class Browser window. Click the desired
   class from the list to reopen it.

 - You can use Shift+F10 to bring up the right-click Shortcut menu.

 - You can right-click in the Class Browser and click Export on the Shortcut
   menu to export a class definition to a .prg file.

 - You can default to a specific class and member name when you are starting up
   the Class Browser programmatically. See the following example:

         DO (_browser) WITH "mylib","myclass.cMessage"

 - You can drag and drop the class icon from within the Class Browser onto the
   Command window to execute the following commands (the icon to drag is located
   next to the Type drop-down list box in the Class Browser):

         SET CLASSLIB TO <classlib> ADDITIVE
         objectvar=CREATEOBJECT(<class>)

 - You can rename methods and properties with the Class Browser by right-
   clicking on the method or property and clicking Rename on the Shortcut menu.
   If you rename or move a class, all .vcx and .scx files open in all instances
   of the Class Browser window are updated automatically if they contain those
   subclasses or instances. So, if you rename a class, it is recommended that
   all .vcx and .scx files that use that class or subclass are loaded in the
   Class Browser window. If a form is not in the Class Browser when a class it
   contains is renamed, an instantiation error occurs when you open the form.
   The Class Browser asks you to locate the class.

 - You can drag and drop a class between two instances of the Class Browser. To
   copy, hold down the control key during the drag.

 - You can drag and drop an instance of the selected class onto a running form
   or container, adding it to that container (or desktop, which adds to
   _screen). You can also do this manually. First, select the class that you
   want to create in the Class Browser, then click in the Command window to
   place the blinking cursor in the Command window. Second, move the mouse
   pointer to a form or the Visual FoxPro desktop, making sure the blinking
   cursor is still in the Command window. Then, in the Command window, execute
   the following command:

         _oBrowser.FormAddObject(SYS(1270))

   An instance of the class is created where the mouse is located.

 - Type library information can be viewed by doing the following:

   1. In the Class Browser, click the Open button or the View Additional File
      button.

   2. In the Files of type drop-down list in the Open dialog box, choose
      Application, *.olb, or *.tlb.

   The type library information for the selected file is displayed in the Members
   list. (You can view this information in Help by searching for "type library"
   (without the quotation marks).)
