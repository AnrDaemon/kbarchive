SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the Pool Manager sample in Visual FoxPro 5.0 and later.
The Pool Manager is an example of a Custom OLE Automation Server created in
Visual FoxPro.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Pool Manager sample (located in Samples\Servers) illustrates Custom OLE
Automation Servers, created in Visual FoxPro, used to balance work loads and
handle job requests from clients.

NOTE: The sample is merely an example and not necessarily optimized for use in an
industrial setting.

You (the client) can send jobs to the Pool Manager (Visual FoxPro Custom OLE
Server), which might be remote, and have the Pool Manager handle the job
processing. This allows you to continue working (asynchronously) because the
Pool Manager is handling all the work. The client does not need a timer
continuously checking to see if a job is done, because the Pool Manager makes an
OLE call back. The jobs requested are dummy simulation jobs.

You can expand the Pool Manager class to provide better control on how many
servers to deploy, timing of servers, and so forth. All of these are variables
that can be controlled by the user to impact performance.
