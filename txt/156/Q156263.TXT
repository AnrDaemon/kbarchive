TITLE   :Some Text Not Printed When Using HP DeskJet 855c
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 855c, you may notice
that some of the text is missing or has been clipped from the page. The same
document can be printed correctly from Microsoft Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT 4.0 printer driver for the HP DeskJet 855c has a larger
unprintable area than the printer driver included with Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

To print your documents correctly, use one of the following methods:

 - Use Windows 95 to print to the HP DeskJet 855c.

 - Adjust the text in the document into the printable region on the page.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The unprintable region on the page is the region outside the margins allowed by
the printer driver. The following table lists the unprintable region (in inches)
for the HP DeskJet 855c printer drivers in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 95:
