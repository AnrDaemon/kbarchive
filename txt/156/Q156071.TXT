TITLE   :PRB: Launching .Exe File Returns "Document Is Locked" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When launching an executable by double-clicking the file, the following error
message appears:

   The document <document name> is locked, so you will not be able to save
   any changes. Do you want to open it anyway?

   <Cancel> <OK>

After the error message appears, you can click OK to start the executable.

CAUSE
=====

The file is locked, usually at the Finder level.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Select the document at the Finder level.

2. From the File menu, choose Get Info, or press Command+I.

3. Deselect the Locked option (in the lower left corner), and close the Get Info
   dialog box.

NOTE: If a Word for Macintosh document locks in a similar manner and you
double-click the document, the same error message returns.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Visual FoxPro for Macintosh 3.0b the executable file is a Microsoft FoxPro
document instead of an application program as it is in FoxPro for Macintosh 2.6.
Therefore, it depends on the Visual FoxPro Support Library as its application.

For multi-user applications, the Visual FoxPro for Macintosh Support Library
should be locked instead of the executable file.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Visual FoxPro for Macintosh 3.0 executable file.

2. Go to the Finder, and select the executable file.

3. From the File menu, choose Get Info and check the Locked box. Close the Get
   Info dialog box.

4. Double-click the executable file.
