SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the REPLACE command with a path that contains a space character,
the command will not be accepted.

character such as "test 1" and "test 2", the command will not be accepted and
you will receive the following error message:

   Invalid switch - 2
   No files replaced.

CAUSE

The utility does not parse the command line correctly; it ignores the quotes.
