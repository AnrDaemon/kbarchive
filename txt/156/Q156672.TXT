TITLE   :PRB: "Variable <variable> is not found" Using #INCLUDE Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a predefined constant is referenced in a class or form, the following error
message may be displayed:

   Variable "<variable>" is not found..
   <Cancel> <Suspend> <Ignore> <Help>

CAUSE
=====

The header file of predefined compile-time constants has not been properly
included in the class or form.

WORKAROUND
==========

Method 1
--------

Include the header file in class or form using the following steps:

1. Open the class or form.

2. From the Class or Form menu, choose Include File.

3. In the Include File dialog box, specify the header file in the Include File
   text box or choose the three-dot button to open the Include dialog box and
   choose the file.

Method 2
--------

Insert the #INCLUDE in the application menu's general options, in the menu setup
snippet.

Method 3
--------

In every event or method on the class or form that references the predefined
constant, reissue the #INCLUDE "<filename>".

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Predefined constants are defined by the #DEFINE directive. Generally, a series
of #DEFINEs is included in a header file. In turn, this header file is
referenced by a #INCLUDE in the class or form. This error usually occurs because
the #INCLUDE is issued in the Load event of the class or form. By the time the
event or method is called on the class or form that references the predefined
constants, the constant is out of scope.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. In the Load event of the form, enter the following code:

      #INCLUDE C:\VFP\SAMPLES\MAINSAMP\INCLUDE\TASTRADE.H

3. Add a Command button to the form. In the Click event of the Command button,
   add the following MessageBox that references a constant in the Tastrade.H
   file:

      =MessageBox(inifile)

4. Run the form, and click the Command button.
