TITLE   :PRB: "Missing Operand" Using TIME() with WAIT WINDOW Command
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro, you can use the WAIT WINDOW command with any character
expression to display a message in the upper right corner of the Visual FoxPro
desktop. However, when you try to use the TIME() function with the WAIT WINDOW
command, as in WAIT WINDOW TIME(), you receive the following error message:

   Missing Operand

CAUSE
=====

Although the TIME() function is returning a character string, the WAIT WINDOW
command is interpreting the first four characters of the function (TIME) as an
abbreviation for the TIMEOUT command. The TIMEOUT command is expecting a numeric
value as its first clause, but instead it is being passed a value of "()." Since
this is not a valid numeric value, the "Missing Operand" error occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use the following workaround:

      WAIT WINDOW ""+TIME()  && Includes the double quotation

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Type the following in the Command window:

      WAIT WINDOW Time()
