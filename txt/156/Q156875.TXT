TITLE   :PRB: Empty Bars Appear in Shortcut Menu
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Empty bars appear within a shortcut menu after creating the menu with the DEFINE
POPUP command.

CAUSE
=====

The DEFINE POPUP command did not include the RELATIVE clause.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the RELATIVE clause to the DEFINE POPUP command. This clause prevents blank
spaces from appearing within the shortcut menu. Change the DEFINE POPOP command
to read:

      DEFINE POPUP Test SHORTCUT RELATIVE

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the DEFINE POPUP command lacks the RELATIVE clause, the order of a particular
menu bar depends on its bar number. In the example below, the shortcut menu
contains three system menu bars and a bar defined as "BAR 4." Bars 1, 2, and 3
are not defined; therefore, three spaces appear between the "Paste" and "Date"
bar items.

The Menu Builder automatically places the RELATIVE clause on the DEFINE POPUP
command it uses to create shortcut menus.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program that contains the following code:

         DEFINE POPUP Test SHORTCUT
         DEFINE BAR _MED_CUT OF Test PROMPT "Cut"
         DEFINE BAR _MED_COPY OF Test PROMPT "Copy"
         DEFINE BAR _MED_PASTE OF Test PROMPT "Paste"
         DEFINE BAR 4 OF Test PROMPT "Date"
         ON SELECTION BAR 4 OF Test KEYBOARD DTOC(DATE())
         ACTIVATE POPUP Test AT MROW(),MCOL()

2. Run the program. The shortcut menu contains several blanks lines within it.

3. Click the mouse and the shortcut menu disappears.
