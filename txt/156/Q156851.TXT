TITLE   :PRB:Run to Cursor and Breakpoints Don't Work After Debug.Break
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbProgramming kbtool kbDebug kbEEdition kbSQL kbVC kbSQLProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

"Run to cursor" and breakpoints do not work after Debug.Break when debugging a
SQL Server stored procedure on Windows 95.


RESOLUTION
==========

Debug.Break is not supported when debugging a SQL stored procedure. This is by
design.

When debugging a SQL stored procedure, the debugger always stops on the first
line of executable code in the stored procedure. You can then set breakpoints
and use the "Run to cursor" feature.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start debugging a SQL Server stored procedure and immediately select Break
   from the Debug menu.


2. Right-click the stored procedure window and select the option "Run to
   Cursor".

The stored procedure will run to completion. It will not stop at cursor. If there
are additional breakpoints, these will not be hit.
