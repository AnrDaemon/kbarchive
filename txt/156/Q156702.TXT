SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the expected behavior, under Windows NT 4.0, of My
Computer when "Browse folders using a separate window for each folder" is
selected on the View\Options menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the "Browse folders using a separate window for each folder" button is
selected under the View\Options pull-down menu of My Computer, new windows
created by clicking on a folder will default to using large icons, status bar
enabled, and no toolbar. All root level settings under the View menu may be
defined by the user on a per folder basis. Once defined, the following settings
are stored for each window title (such as c:\winnt) for the 50 most recently
used windows on a per user basis:

   Toolbar enabled/disabled
   Status bar enabled/disabled
   Icon Size (large, small, list, details)
   Arrange Icons (name, type, size, date)

NOTE: No check mark, or other visual cue, is displayed to indicate what ordering
scheme (by name, type, size, or date) is used to display folders and files under
the View\Arrange Icons menu, with the exception of the Auto Arrange setting.
Unless manually defined, the default option of sorting by name is used.

Settings in the View tab under View\Options are not saved when multiple windows
are used, even if manually defined. Default settings are used for all new and
previously modified folders.

This category, along with the default settings, includes:

   Show all files (not enabled)
   Hide files of these type: (enabled)
   Display the full path in the title bar (not enabled)
   Hide file extensions for known file types (enabled)
   Display compress files and folders with alternate colors (not enabled)

If the single window view is used, settings under the view menu (including icon
size, toolbar visibility, and sort criteria), are inherited from the parent
window they were launched from, along with settings in the View tab under the
View\Options menu. This behavior is by design, and is consistent with the
Windows 95 interface, which was the design goal for Windows NT 4.0.
