TITLE   :PRB: Caption Dithered If DisabledForeColor Equals ForeColor
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

For certain Visual FoxPro controls, if the DisabledForeColor property is set the
same as the ForeColor property when the control is disabled, the disabled
control's foreground color appears dithered. This behavior applies to command
buttons, labels, option buttons, and check boxes. This behavior also affects how
their captions appear.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the DisabledForeColor property to be 1 (one) different from the ForeColor
property. For example, place the following code in the Init method for a check
box:

      this.DisabledForeColor = this.ForeColor + 1

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs when the two properties are set the same. Because the
control is disabled, its caption appears dithered to indicate the control is
disabled. In certain cases, you may want the disabled control to appear nearly
identical to the enabled control. If so, use the technique in the WORKAROUND
section above.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.prg) file:

         * Start of code example
         *
         PUBLIC oform1
         oform1=CREATEOBJECT("form1")
         oform1.SHOW

         DEFINE CLASS form1 AS FORM

           HEIGHT = 184
           WIDTH = 251
           AUTOCENTER = .T.
           CAPTION = "DisabledForeColor Test"
           NAME = "Form1"

           ADD OBJECT label1 AS LABEL WITH ;
             CAPTION = "Label1", ;
             LEFT = 24, ;
             TOP = 12, ;
             AUTOSIZE = .T., ;
             NAME = "Label1"

           ADD OBJECT optiongroup1 AS OPTIONGROUP WITH ;
             BUTTONCOUNT = 2, ;
             VALUE = 1, ;
             LEFT = 24, ;
             TOP = 48, ;
             AUTOSIZE = .T., ;
             NAME = "Optiongroup1", ;
             option1.CAPTION = "Option1", ;
             option1.VALUE = 1, ;
             option1.LEFT = 5, ;
             option1.TOP = 5, ;
             option1.AUTOSIZE = .T., ;
             option2.CAPTION = "Option2", ;
             option2.VALUE = 0, ;
             option2.LEFT = 5, ;
             option2.TOP = 24, ;
             option2.AUTOSIZE = .T.

           ADD OBJECT check1 AS CHECKBOX WITH ;
             TOP = 12, ;
             LEFT = 132, ;
             AUTOSIZE = .T., ;
             CAPTION = "Check1", ;
             NAME = "Check1"

           ADD OBJECT check2 AS CHECKBOX WITH ;
             TOP = 132, ;
             LEFT = 24, ;
             AUTOSIZE = .T., ;
             CAPTION = "Disable all", ;
             NAME = "Check2"

           ADD OBJECT check3 AS CHECKBOX WITH ;
             TOP = 132, ;
             LEFT = 132, ;
             AUTOSIZE = .T., ;
             CAPTION = "Add the 1?", ;
             NAME = "Check3"

           ADD OBJECT command1 AS COMMANDBUTTON WITH ;
             TOP = 60, ;
             LEFT = 120, ;
             HEIGHT = 27, ;
             WIDTH = 90, ;
             CAPTION = "Command1", ;
             NAME = "Command1"

           PROCEDURE optiongroup1.option1.REFRESH
             THIS.DISABLEDFORECOLOR=THIS.FORECOLOR + THISFORM.check3.VALUE
           ENDPROC

           PROCEDURE optiongroup1.option2.REFRESH
             THIS.DISABLEDFORECOLOR=THIS.FORECOLOR + THISFORM.check3.VALUE
           ENDPROC

           PROCEDURE check1.REFRESH
             THIS.DISABLEDFORECOLOR=THIS.FORECOLOR + THISFORM.check3.VALUE
           ENDPROC

           PROCEDURE check2.CLICK
             THISFORM.label1.DISABLEDFORECOLOR = ;
               THISFORM.label1.FORECOLOR + ;
               THISFORM.check3.VALUE  &&  Added because Label has no refresh
             THISFORM.REFRESH
             THISFORM.SETALL('enabled',!THISFORM.check1.ENABLED)
             THIS.ENABLED=.T.
           ENDPROC

           PROCEDURE command1.REFRESH
             THIS.DISABLEDFORECOLOR=THIS.FORECOLOR + THISFORM.check3.VALUE
           ENDPROC

         ENDDEFINE
         *
         * End of code example

2. Click the "Disable all" check box. The captions of the disabled controls
   appear dithered.

3. To demonstrate the workaround, clear the "Disable all" check box, click the
   "Add the 1?" check box, and click the "Disable all" check box. The control
   captions are not dithered but are still displayed with a 3-D effect.

NOTE: Depending on whether the "Add the 1?" check box is checked, the
DisabledForeColor property for each of the controls is set to either its
ForeColor (the "Add the 1?" check box is cleared) or its ForeColor + 1 (the "Add
the 1?" check box is cleared).
