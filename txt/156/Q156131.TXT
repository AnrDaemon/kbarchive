MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are known errors in the Game Reference documentation for Close
Combat:

 - On page 175 of the Index, the Game Reference manual states that information
   on Troop carriers can be found on page 117. This information can actually be
   found on page 110.

 - On page 170 of the Index, the Game Reference manual states that information
   about Halftracks can be found on page 117. This information can actually be
   found on page 110.

 - Although it is stated in the Game Reference manual that Troop carriers and
   Halftracks were used for the transportation of troops in the War, you cannot
   order troops to go into these vehicles in Close Combat. There intended use
   for game play is to provide suppression fire and/or support fire during
   infantry assaults.
