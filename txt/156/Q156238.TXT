TITLE   :PRB: Form Not Released from Menu Pad or ON KEY LABEL
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A form released from a procedure or command called from a menu or an ON KEY
LABEL command is not actually released until the command or procedure has
completed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the Visible property of the form to .F. - False to hide the form until the
procedure that releases it has finished executing.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Keypress event of the form intercepts the keystroke, and the form cannot be
released until the procedure or command called by the keystroke has completed.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a .prg:

      ON KEY LABEL F3 DO Release_It
      oForm = CREATEOBJECT('form')
      oForm.Caption = "Press F3 to release form, then F3 to Clear Events"
      oForm.SHOW()
      READ EVENTS
      ON KEY LABEL F3

      PROCEDURE Release_It
          oForm.RELEASE
          =MESSAGEBOX("Though form has been released, _SCREEN.Formcount = " ;
            + ALLTR(STR(_SCREEN.FORMCOUNT,1)) + ". Press F3 after OK to " ;
            + "return to Command Window." ,0)
          ON KEY LABEL F3 CLEAR EVENTS
      ENDPROC

2. Press the F3 key. The message box indicates the form still exists since the
   FormCount property of the _SCREEN system variable still returns 1.

3. Click OK then press F3 to return to the Command window.

Modify the Release_It procedure in the above example as follows to demonstrate
the workaround. (The form is still not immediately released from memory but
setting the Visible property to .F. - False makes it appear released.)

      PROCEDURE Release_It
         oForm.Visible = .F.
         oForm.RELEASE
         =MESSAGEBOX("Though form has been released, _SCREEN.Formcount = " ;
           + ALLTR(STR(_SCREEN.FORMCOUNT,1)) + ". Press F3 after OK to " ;
           + "return to Command Window." ,0)
         ON KEY LABEL F3 CLEAR EVENTS
      ENDPROC
