======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Visual FoxPro 5.0 or later, when a page within a PageFrame control becomes
active, the focus is placed on the caption of the tab of the active page. Visual
FoxPro versions 3.0 and 3.0b do not exhibit this behavior.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example shows you how to create a PageFrame control and hide the
focus on the caption of the tab of the active page:

1. Create a form.

2. Place a Container control onto the form, name it "CONTAINER1," and set the
   following properties in the Properties window:

   BORDERWIDTH = 0
   LEFT = 60
   TOP = 60
   WIDTH = 348
   HEIGHT = 200

3. Right-click the Container control. On the Shortcut menu, click Edit. Place a
   PageFrame control into the Container control, and name it "PAGEFRAME1." Set
   the following properties for the PageFrame control in the Properties window:

   LEFT = 0
   TOP = 0
   WIDTH = 348
   HEIGHT = 200

4. Remove the caption for all pages within the PageFrame control by deleting the
   value in the Caption property.

   You should have a PageFrame control, with no captions for any of the pages,
   inside a Container control

5. Making sure the Container control is in the Edit mode and not the PageFrame
   control, place two labels where the deleted captions used to be, and name
   them "LABEL1" and "LABEL2."

6. Set the Caption property for these two labels to the appropriate value in the
   Properties window, such as Page1 for LABEL1 and Page2 for LABEL2.

7. In the Click event of LABEL1, add the following code:

         THISFORM.CONTAINER1.PAGEFRAME1.ACTIVEPAGE = 1

   In the Click event for LABLE2, add the following code:

         THISFORM.CONTAINER1.PAGEFRAME1.ACTIVEPAGE = 2

8. Save and run the form.

When you click the tab of the page within the PageFrame control, no focus shows
up for the active page tab.
