TITLE   :Incorrect Error on Dial-In Only Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message can appear on a dial-in only RAS server:

   The xxxx protocol can not be selected because it is not installed or it is
   disabled for Remote Access. To change, in Control Panel start Network, choose
   Services page, Remote Access Properties, and press the Network button.

This error message is incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

If you configure a RAS server for dial-in only, start Dial-Up Networking (to
dial out), and select a protocol under the server tab (independent of the
dial-up server type chosen), you get an error message incorrectly saying that
you don't have the protocol installed or you don't have the protocol enabled for
RAS.

Because dial-out is disabled on the computer, the error message should be
something like the following (which you might see if the Dial-Up Networking tool
is started from Accessories):

   This server is configured to be a dial-in only server. You cannot use phone
   book to configure dial-out options. Please contact your administrator for
   more information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
