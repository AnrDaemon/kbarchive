SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT 4.0 password cannot be changed from the Microsoft Exchange
Macintosh client. The scenario is as follows (this is the same for Banyan Vines
TCP/IP clients):

You are using the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client and attempting to change
the Windows NT password by clicking Options on the Tools menu. On the Exchange
Server tab, you click Password. After you type all the information and click OK,
the following message appears:

   Please enter the AppleTalk Zone of your Microsoft Windows NT Primary
   Domain Controller.

After you enter the Apple-Talk zone and click OK, the following message appears:

   The Windows NT Domain password could not be changed. A required action was
   not successful due to an unspecified error.

As a result, the password is not changed.

RESOLUTION
==========

In order for the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client to change the Windows NT
domain password, the registry must be modified as follows:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

1. On the Windows NT Primary Domain Controller (PDC), start Registry Editor,
   regedt32.exe (regedit.exe in Windows NT 4.0 will not work) to edit the PDC's
   Registry.

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

      SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa

3. Select Lsa to highlight it.

4. On the Edit menu, click Add Value.

5. Make one of the changes listed below, depending on whether AppleTalk or
   TCP\IP protocol will be used:

   For password support using AppleTalk protocol, enter:

      Value Name:  AppletalkClientSupport
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
      DWORD Editor Data: 1

   -OR-

   For password support using TCP/IP protocol, enter:

      Value Name:  TCPIPClientSupport
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
      DWORD Editor Data: 1

6. Restart the primary domain controller (PDC).

7. From Windows NT User Manager for Domains, select a user account of a
   Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client user. On the Policies menu, click
   Account. At the bottom of the Account Policy dialog box is the check box
   "Users must log on in order to change password". Make sure this check box is
   cleared.

8. If using TCP/IP as connecting protocol, the client must have a hosts file or
   Domain Name Service (DNS) with entries for both Microsoft Exchange Server and
   the Windows NT PDC. (The A and CNAME records)

With the above configuration in place, you can now change the Windows NT domain
password using the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh Client as follows:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. On the Exchange Server tab, click the Password button.

3. Type the information and click OK. A message appears stating:

      Your password has been changed.

   Future log on process(es) to domain resources will use the new password.
