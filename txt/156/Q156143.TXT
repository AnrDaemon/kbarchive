The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2

SYMPTOMS
========

You can use the Execute SQL toolbar button to stop executing a stored procedure
or SQL script that is currently executing. However, there is no visual
indication of this functionality.

CAUSE
=====

The Execute SQL button does not display a different tool tip or glyph to
indicate its state.

WORKAROUND
==========

The button's internal state toggles correctly between execute and stop execute,
so you can use it to stop executing.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.
