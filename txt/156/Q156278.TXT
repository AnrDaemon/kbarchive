TITLE   :SMS: Error -39 in File Cpackage.cpp
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a package from a Package Command Manager (PCM) window on a
Macintosh client, you receive the following error message:

   Error -39 in File Cpackage.cpp, Line 570 eofErr.
   End of File
   Command Failed to Execute

   Error -39 in FileCTable.cpp, Line 198 eofErr.
   End of File.

Also, if you use Resedit to examine the Macintosh file, it will not have a
resource fork.

CAUSE
=====

Renaming a Macintosh file to comply with the 8.3 naming convention and then
sending it out as a package causes the Systems Management Server Scheduler
service not to require the Windows NT file system (NTFS) when distributing the
file. Without this requirement, the resource fork is lost.

When the Scheduler creates a package for distribution, it checks for files with
long filenames. If such a file is detected, the Scheduler sets a flag requiring
NTFS for the package destination. The despooler should not attempt to distribute
the package when it detects the flag. For more information on this behavior, see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q139589 Distribution of Files with Long Filenames Require NTFS

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not rename Macintosh files using the 8.3 naming
format.
