TITLE   :Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack Disables Dual Boot for 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 2, 3, or 4, you may receive the
following error message when you choose Windows NT 4.0 from the Windows NT boot
menu:

   Windows NT could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:

   %systemroot%\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM

   You can attempt to repair this file by starting the Windows NT setup using the
   original setup floppy disk or CD-ROM. Select 'r' at the first screen to start
   repair.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Ntldr file included with Windows NT 3.51
Service Pack 2, 3, or 4, is incapable of starting Windows NT 4.0.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, replace the Ntldr file with the Windows NT 4.0 version of
the file. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Start your computer using Windows NT 3.51.

2. Using File Manager or Command Prompt, copy the Ntldr file from the Windows NT
   4.0 CD-ROM to the root folder of the boot drive. For example, if you are
   using Command Prompt and the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM is inserted in drive D,
   type the following line:

   "copy d:\i386\ntldr c:\ntldr" (without the quotation marks)

3. When you are prompted whether to overwrite the existing file, choose Yes.

4. Restart your computer.
