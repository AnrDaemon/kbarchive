TITLE   :BUG: GETCOLOR Function Does Not Return Focus to Custom Color
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Color dialog does not properly highlight a custom color that was previously
selected with the GETCOLOR() function. Therefore, attempting to return focus
within the Colors dialog to the earlier selected custom color fails.

CAUSE
=====

The GETCOLOR() function calls the Colors dialog box, which is a Windows common
dialog. Visual FoxPro has no control over what gets the initial focus in this
dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The GETCOLOR function does not return focus to a previously-created custom
color. The cursor rectangle surrounds the upper-left color object in the Basic
Colors section of the Color dialog. However, a bold border appears around the
custom color object.

One can return focus to a color selected from the Basic Colors section of the
Colors dialog.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Command window, type:

         i=GETCOLOR()

2. Click the Define Custom Color button in the Color dialog.

3. Change the LUM field to 150, and choose a color.

4. Click the Add to Custom Colors button. The color appears under Custom Colors
   section.

5. Click the OK button.

6. In the Command window, type,

      j=GETCOLOR(i)
