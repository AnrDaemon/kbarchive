The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A new Application property has been added to all objects in Visual FoxPro
version 5.0. This includes both the OLE Bound control and the OLE Container
control. If you have OLE Automation code that does not use the Object property
(.object) to reference the various properties and methods of the object, a
conflict occurs between the Visual FoxPro Application property and the
Application property of the OLE object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have OLE Automation code in which you have not used the Object property
(.object) to reference the properties and methods of the OLE object, then Visual
FoxPro 5.0 assumes the references are for the Visual FoxPro Application object
properties and methods.

For example, create an OLE object with the following commands:

      PUBLIC frmMyForm
      frmMyForm = CREATEOBJECT("form")
      frmMyForm.AddObject("oleTest","OLEControl","Excel.Chart")
      frmMyForm.Visible=.T.

After the code runs, a form appears, but you do not see the Excel chart.

Now enter the following command:

      WAIT WINDOW frmMyForm.oleTest.Application.Name

The message that appears is "Microsoft Visual FoxPro" in Visual FoxPro version
5.0 and "Microsoft Excel" in Visual FoxPro version 3.x.

To make the Excel chart object appear, issue the following command:

      frmMyForm.oleTest.Object.Application.Visible=.t.

If you use the following Quit method:

      frmMyForm.oleTest.application.quit

Visual FoxPro version 5.0 calls the Quit method of Visual FoxPro, instead of the
Quit method of the OLE object as in Visual FoxPro version 3.x.

In order to reference the properties and methods of the OLE object, you need to
update your code to use the Object property as in the following line of code:

      WAIT WINDOW frmMyForm.oleTest.Object.Application.Name
      frmMyForm.oleTest.Object.Application.Quit

Object and _VFP System Variable in the applies to list. This property is exposed
to all Visual FoxPro base classes.
