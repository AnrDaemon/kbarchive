TITLE   :General Error=51 Connecting to an Access Datasource
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a query to an Microsoft Access database using Internet Database
Connector (IDC), you may receive the following error:

   [State=S1000][Error=51][Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access 7.0
   Driver]General Error
   Not enough information to connect to this DSN with SQLConnect. Use
   SQLDriverConnect.

CAUSE
=====

This can be caused by one of two reasons.

 - The key for this datasource has a permission restriction applied.

 - The key for the datasource does not have the appropriate subkey values added.
   This can be caused by a corrupt key or the subkey is missing.

The key location is:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBC.INI\Access_data_source_name\Engines\Jet 2.x

WORKAROUND
==========

If the key for this datasource has a permission restriction applied, make sure
the user who is logging into the database has read and execute permissions to
the datasource key.

If the key for the datasource does not have the appropriate subkey values added.
The Access_data_source_name will exist, but the other subkey will not be there.
If you delete the datasource from the ODBC Manager, the entry may remain in the
registry. You may have to remove the entire entry of the Datasource from the
registry manually and then add a new datasource from the ODBC Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

See Chapter 8 of the on-line product documentation for the Internet Information
Server (IIS) version 2.0 for a more complete guide in the use of IDC. This
chapter also includes help on creating System DSNs.

Included with IIS are numerous IDC/HTX samples located in the
X:\IIS_Directory\Scripts\Samples\ directory, where X is the drive letter and
iis_Directory is the name given to the install directory of IIS.

See the Windows NT Resource Kit for further information on the use of the
Registry Editor.
