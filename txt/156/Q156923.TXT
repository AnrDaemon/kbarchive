TITLE   :PRB: IMPORT FROM Paradox Fails on Numeric Fields on Macintosh
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.6a,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The conversion of a Paradox database that contains numeric fields to Visual
FoxPro for Macintosh 3.0b or FoxPro for Macintosh 2.6a results in a table with
numeric fields that now contain zeros. The error "Numeric overflow, data was
lost" may also appear. This behavior does not occur with Visual FoxPro for
Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

Possible workarounds include the following:

 - Convert the numeric fields to character fields within Paradox, before
   importing and then back to numeric fields in FoxPro once the import is
   complete.

 - Save the Paradox table out to a delimited text file and then use the FoxPro
   command APPEND FROM <filename> TYPE DELIMITED, to import the data into
   a newly defined table structure in FoxPro.

 - Import the Paradox table into Visual FoxPro for Windows and then transport
   the table over to the Macintosh.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Using a Paradox table, type the following command in FoxPro:

   " IMPORT FROM <Paradox table name> TYPE PDOX " (without the quotation
   marks)

The numeric fields within the FoxPro table contain zeros and the error "Numeric
overflow, data was lost" may occur. The Character fields import correctly.
