======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After changing the format of a memo field to upper case in the Report Writer,
the error "String Too Long to Fit" appears when attempting to print or preview
the report.

CAUSE
=====

The Report Writer's expression builder cannot convert fields larger than 256
characters to upper case. You must use the UPPER() function to convert those
fields.

WORKAROUND
==========

In the Report Expression box for the field, use the UPPER() function to
transform the memo-field contents to upper case.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
