KEYWORDS:kbhw kbsetup diskmem win95 kbHardware kbDiskMemory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Windows 95 on a computer with an Intel 82371SB PIIX3 IDE
hard disk controller, Windows 95 may not detect devices installed on the
secondary IDE channel. If the devices are initially detected and appear in
Device Manager, they may no longer appear in Device Manager the next time you
restart the computer.

CAUSE
=====

The Intel 82371SB PIIX3 IDE hard disk controller is not included in the
Mshdc.inf file included with Windows 95. Therefore, although the controller is
detected by Windows 95 and appears in Device Manager, it may not be properly
configured. This may prevent devices on the secondary IDE channel from being
detected or installed properly.

The following computers are known to contain Intel 82371SB PIIX3 IDE hard disk
controllers:

 - Dell Dimension Pentium Pro 200

 - Hewlett-Packard Vectra VL 5/xxx Series 4

STATUS
======

This situation is most likely caused by design changes in Windows 95. Microsoft
has confirmed that this situation is not caused by problems in Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

For information about how to work around this problem, please contact Intel.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem affects all Intel motherboards that contain the 82371SB PIIX3
onboard IDE hard disk controller. When you install Windows 95 on a computer that
contains an 82371SB PIIX3 controller, the controller is detected and installed
by Windows 95. However, because the Mshdc.inf file does not contain
configuration information for the controller, the secondary IDE channel on the
controller may not be configured properly.

Because the secondary channel is not configured properly, it is typically
disabled by the BIOS the next time you restart your computer. This causes
Windows 95 to determine that the devices installed on the secondary channel have
been removed from your computer, and causes Windows 95 to remove the devices
from Device Manager.

To determine if the 82371SB PIIX3 IDE hard disk controller in your computer is
configured properly, double-click the System icon in Control Panel, click the
Device Manager tab, and then double-click the Hard Disk Controllers branch to
expand it. If the following devices appear under the Hard Disk Controllers
branch, the 82371SB PIIX3 controller is not configured properly and the problem
described in this article is likely to occur:

 - Primary IDE Controller (single FIFO)

 - Standard Dual PCI IDE Controller

 - Standard IDE/ESDI Hard Disk Controller
