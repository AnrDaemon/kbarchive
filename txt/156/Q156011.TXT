SUMMARY
=======

Using an offline view with the ADMIN clause on the USE command allows users who
are unable to reestablish a connection back to the server to revert to or
identify added, deleted, or modified rows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ADMIN clause on the USE command for offline views is a subset of the ONLINE
clause. When you are using the ADMIN clause, you have all the same capabilities
as the ONLINE clause, except that you cannot issue a TABLEUPDATE command. In the
ADMIN mode, the user does not reestablish a link back to the server. In the
ADMIN and ONLINE modes, the user knows which rows have been added, deleted, or
modified in the offline view when using the GETNEXTMODIFIED or GETFLDSTATE
commands. The ADMIN mode is needed for users who may be unable to reconnect back
to the server, but want to identify added, deleted, or modified rows. Using only
the USE command with a offline view does not allow a user to do this.
