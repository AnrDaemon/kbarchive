SUMMARY
=======

This article provides tips on troubleshooting problems if you encounter
difficulties installing Deadly Tide.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows
-------

Deadly Tide requires Microsoft Windows 95/98 or Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. To
purchase a Windows upgrade, see your local retailer.

DirectX 2.0
-----------

To play Deadly Tide, you must have DirectX 2.0 or later installed on your
computer. DirectX makes Deadly Tide play faster and smoother because the Windows
drivers allow for direct access to your computer's hardware.

If you have any problems installing Deadly Tide, use the following
troubleshooting steps.

 - If you try to run Deadly Tide and get an error message (for example, "Cannot
   find Ddraw.dll"), you need to reinstall DirectX files.

   To reinstall DirectX files, run the Deadly Tide Setup program, and then click
   Reinstall.

 - If you experience display problems after you install DirectX 2.0, try
   changing the refresh rate.

   To change the monitor refresh rate:

   1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

   2. Double-click Display.

   3. Click the Settings tab.

   4. Click Change Display Type to display the Advanced Display Properties
      dialog box.

      NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2),
      click Advanced Properties, and if you are using Microsoft Windows 98,
      click Advanced.

   5. Click the Adapter tab. If there is no Adapter tab, see the next set of
      steps, "To Select a DirectX-Compatible Driver."

   6. In the Refresh Rate box, change the refresh rate, and then click OK.

 - If your screen is unreadable or you are unable to follow the preceding steps,
   try selecting a DirectX-compatible driver or downloading the latest version
   of DirectX.

   To select a DirectX-compatible driver:

   1. Restart Windows in Safe mode. To do so, follow the steps in the
      appropriate section below:

      Microsoft Windows 95
      --------------------

      Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message,
      press the F8 key, and then choose Safe Mode from the Startup menu.

      Microsoft Windows 98
      --------------------

      Restart your computer, press and hold down the CTRL key after your computer
      completes the Power On Self Test (POST), and then choose Safe Mode from
      the Startup menu.

   2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

   3. Double-click Display.

   4. Click the Settings tab.

   5. Click Change Display Type to display the Change Display Type dialog box.

      NOTE: If you are using OSR2, click Advanced Properties, and if you are
      using Microsoft Windows 98, click Advanced.

   6. Under Adapter Type, click Change.

      NOTE: If you are using OSR2 or Windows 98, click the Adapter tab, and then
      click Change.

   7. In the Select Device dialog box, select the DirectX-compatible video
      driver suggested by your video card manufacturer. If you do not have a
      DirectX-compatible video driver, contact your video card manufacturer for
      an updated video driver.

      NOTE: If you are using Windows 98, follow the steps in the Update Device
      Driver wizard to select a compatible video driver.

   8. Restart your computer to apply this change.

   Download the latest version of DirectX.

   NOTE: Most DirectX related issues have been resolved in the latest version of
   DirectX. Download the latest version of DirectX using the instructions below.
   Or, if you own a game that installs a later version of DirectX, install
   DirectX from the newer game's CD-ROM.

   The latest version of DirectX is available at the following Microsoft Web
   site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/directx

   For more information about how to obtain the latest version of DirectX, please
   see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
