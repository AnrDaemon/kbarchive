TITLE   :PRB: Word Wrap is Disabled when Syntax Coloring Is Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to turn Word Wrap on while editing a .prg file in Visual FoxPro 5.0
or 6.0, make sure that the Syntax Coloring check box is not selected. The Word
Wrap check box is automatically disabled when the Syntax Coloring check box is
selected. Note that Word Wrap is always disabled when only the Command window is
active.

RESOLUTION
==========

Clear the Syntax Coloring check box if you want to use the Word Wrap option.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When editing a .prg file, you can make changes in the way the file is edited by
clicking Properties on the Edit menu. This functionally was under Options on the
Tools menu on the Edit Tab in Visual FoxPro 3.0 and has been changed in Visual
FoxPro 5.0 or 6.0. To ensure that words wrap correctly while editing the file,
make sure that the Word Wrap check box is cleared. If the Word Wrap check box is
grayed out, clear the Syntax Coloring check box. The Word Wrap and Syntax
Coloring check boxes cannot be checked at the same time. Also, Word Wrap is
never available when the Command window is the active window.

NOTE: "Syntax Coloring" is always dimmed when you are editing a .txt file.
