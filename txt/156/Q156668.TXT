TITLE   :PRB: SET PATH TO Syntax for Folders with Spaces in Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.6a,3.0; WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,6.0

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, Professional Edition, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Only the first folder or directory specified in a multiple path string is set by
the SET PATH TO command. For example, the first folder listed in the sample SET
PATH TO command below is set in the FoxPro path:

      SET PATH TO "c:\New Folder 1";"c:\New Folder 2"

CAUSE
=====

The path listed after the SET PATH TO command is set only until the second
quotation mark is found.

RESOLUTION
==========

When using the SET PATH TO command with multiple folders that contain spaces,
either place quotes around the entire path string or don't use quotes at all.
For the example shown above, use one of the following:

      SET PATH TO "c:\New Folder 1;c:\New Folder 2"

   - or -

      SET PATH TO c:\New Folder 1;c:\New Folder 2

This applies to the Macintosh version of FoxPro and Visual FoxPro as well. The
Macintosh syntax would be like this:

      SET PATH TO "Macintosh HD:New Folder 1;Macintosh HD:New Folder 2"

   - or -

      SET PATH TO Macintosh HD:New Folder 1;Macintosh HD:New Folder 2

The path set with the SET PATH TO command can be checked by typing the following
in the Command window:

      ? SET("PATH")

It will return all folders or directories in the FoxPro path if the syntax of the
SET PATH TO command was correct.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
