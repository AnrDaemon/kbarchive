SUMMARY
=======

The View Designer in Visual FoxPro is a useful tool for creating views. This
article discusses a couple of limitations on creating views with the View
Designer versus creating views programmatically using the CREATE SQL VIEW
command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following limitations exist when creating views with the View Designer:

1. The View Designer is unable to load any views that have a sub-select in the
   filter.

   Example:

      CREATE VIEW view1 AS SELECT order_id FROM orders ;
           WHERE order_id IN (SELECT order_id FROM order_line_items)

2. With the new JOIN feature, views that are built with joins in the View
   Designer must be built in a specific manner:

   Example 1: 3 tables: tableA, tableB, tableC
               CORRECT: tableA -> tableB -> tableC

      CREATE VIEW view1 AS SELECT * FROM tableA ;
        INNER JOIN tableB INNER JOIN tableC ON ;
        tableB.linkcol = tableC.linkcol ON ;
        tableA.linkcol = tableB.linkcol

   Example 2: 3 tables: tableA, tableB, tableC
               INCORRECT : tableA -> tableB,  tableA -> tableC

      CREATE VIEW view1 AS SELECT * FROM tableA ;
        INNER JOIN tableB INNER JOIN tableC ON ;
        ON tableA.linkcol = tableC.linkcol ON ;
        tableA.linkcol = tableB.linkcol

Example 2 will cause an error when you try to load it into the View Designer.
