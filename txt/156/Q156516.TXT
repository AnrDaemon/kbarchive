======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a Messaging Application Programming Interface-based (MAPI- based)
program in Windows 95, you may receive error number 26 or the error message
"MAPI_E_NOT_SUPPORTED."

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur after you install Internet Explorer 4.0 or 4.01 or the
Microsoft Distributed COM Update for Windows 95 (DCOM95), or if you are using a
non-English version of Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) or later.

Earlier versions of the Windows Messaging System (WMS) Mapisrvr.exe file do not
support the COM call to the CoCreateInstance() function properly and return the
E_NOINTERFACE value.

NOTE: Because this problem does not occur in Windows 95 with the original WMS
until you install DCOM95 or Internet Explorer 4.0 or 4.01, the problem may seem
to be caused by either DCOM95 or Internet Explorer. The problem actually occurs
because the earlier Mapisrvr.exe file does not properly support calls to the
CoCreateInstance() function.

RESOLUTION
==========

For English-language versions of Windows 95, you can resolve this problem by
installing the latest WMS for Windows 95. The latest WMS is available from the
following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/info/exupd.htm

This update is included in Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 2, 2.1, and
2.5.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the earlier Mapisrvr.exe file
included with the original Windows 95 distribution. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
