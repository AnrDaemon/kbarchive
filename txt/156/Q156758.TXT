SYMPTOMS
========

If you shut down SQL Server while you are monitoring any SQL Server - Procedure
Cache counter in Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe), Perfmon.exe and Winlogon.exe
close with a Divide By Zero Exception error. If you run Perfmon.exe on the
Windows NT console, an Unhandled Exception error in SQLCTR60.DLL appears in
Perfmon.exe.

If you monitor the counter in Perfmon.exe from a client computer, the Exception
error occurs in Winlogon.exe and a STOP: 0xc000021a (Fatal System Error) screen
appears.

In addition, the following Application event appears in Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 8
   Source:  SQLCTR60.DLL
   Description: DB-LIBRARY error: Attempt to bind to a non-existent column.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Do not monitor SQL Server - Procedure Cache counters when you shut down SQL
   Server.

   -or-

 - Use "On Demand Mode" for SQL Server Perfmon Integration. For more
   information, see the "Integration with Windows NT Performance Monitor"
   section in the SQL Server Administrator's Companion guide.
