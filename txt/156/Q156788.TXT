KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500bug kbVS97sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Print Preview to view a report in FoxPro running under Windows NT,
the text in the report is difficult to read when using a low- resolution video
driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

One of the following methods can be used to resolve this problem:

 - The quality of the Print Preview appears to be directly related to the
   current video resolution. The higher the video resolution, the better the
   quality of the Print Preview. Typically, video resolutions of 1024x768 or
   higher yield satisfactory Print Preview quality.

   -or-

 - Create two reports: one for Print Previews and one for printing. In the
   report for Print Preview, increase the font size so that it is readable in
   Print Preview mode. Note that there is less information placed on each page
   in Print Preview mode, which results in the Print Preview showing more pages
   than the report that prints to the printer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug is fixed for Visual FoxPro versions 5.x with
the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2. If using a version of FoxPro or Visual
FoxPro prior to 5.x, use the resolutions provided in this article.

For more information on the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2, please see the

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior

Your system should be running Windows NT 3.51 or higher, and should be configured
with a video resolution of 640x480.

1. Create a new report, or open an existing report.

2. Preview the report. Note that the text in the report is illegible.
