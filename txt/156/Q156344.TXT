======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT 4.0, Plug and Play devices in your computer are not
detected and installed.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 4.0 does not support Plug and Play.

RESOLUTION
==========

The driver library on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM includes the PnP ISA Enabler
driver, which may allow the detection and installation of Plug and Play devices
in Windows NT 4.0. Install the PnP ISA Enabler driver (PNPISA) using the
following steps:

NOTE: Although Windows NT includes PNPISA to detect Plug and Play devices, Plug
and Play devices are not supported in Windows NT 4.0. PNPISA is provided as a
"use at your own risk" tool.

1. Locate the Pnpisa.inf file in the Drvlib\Pnpisa\<processor-type> folder
   on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM.

2. Right-click the Pnpisa.inf file, and then click Install on the menu that
   appears.

3. Restart your computer.

After you restart your computer, you may receive a message that Windows NT has
detected your Plug and Play device(s).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that PNPISA is not enabled by default.

For more information on installing and potential problems review the following
file on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM:
