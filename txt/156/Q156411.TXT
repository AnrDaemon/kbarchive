TITLE   :ENDIF Does Not Work in NetWare Login Script with CSNW/GSNW
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In NetWare login scripts that have an ENDIF command, Client Services for NetWare
(CSNW) or Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) will report the following error
when executing the login script:

   Script error: Could not interpret line
   The original line was :
   Endif.

ENDIF will work when executed from a Novell NetWare client.

Login script example:

      IF MEMBER OF "SUPERVISORS" THEN
          WRITE "blah....."
      ENDIF

RESOLUTION
==========

CSNW and GSNW will work properly with the END command instead of the ENDIF
command.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
