TITLE   :XCON: Subject Line of Message Is Truncated to 40 Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a custom form or a message containing a subject length greater than 40
characters and a message class other than "IPM.Microsoft Mail.Note" is submitted
into Microsoft Exchange Server through the Microsoft Mail Interchange (MSMI),
the subject line of the message is truncated to 40 characters.

CAUSE
=====

During the FIPS to MDBEF conversion for message classes other than
"IPM.Microsoft Mail.Note," the MSMI maps the subject line from the FIPS header
into the MAPI property PR_Subject, instead of the subject line in the body of
the message. The FIPS header subject field is limited to 40 characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Exchange Server 4.0 and 5.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
