MORE INFORMATION
================

You can turn off the AutoRun feature you do not want Windows 95/98 CD-ROM
programs to automatically start. For more information about how to accomplish
this task, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   windows autorun

AutoRun is not supported by MS-DOS CD-ROM drivers. The drivers must be written
specifically for Windows 95/98 and support Auto-Insert Notification.

For best performance when running World Atlas, Microsoft recommends that you use
Windows 95/98 CD-ROM drivers instead of MS-DOS drivers.

To troubleshoot problems with AutoRun, contact your CD-ROM manufacturer or your
Windows 95/98 service provider.
