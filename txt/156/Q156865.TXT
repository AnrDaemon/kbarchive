TITLE   :PRB: Programmatically Converting 3.0 Project in 5.0 Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 3.0 or 3.0b, a FoxPro 2.x project can be programmatically
converted with the MODIFY PROJECT <project name> command. However, in
Visual FoxPro 5.0, the command MODIFY PROJECT <project name> results in
the following error:

   The wrong parameters were passed to the converter. To convert files, open
   them from the file menu.

CAUSE
=====

New codes have been added to the Visual FoxPro 5.0 converter to preserve the
Visual FoxPro 3.0 default. These changes require running the CONVERT program
before issuing the MODIFY PROJECT command.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can convert a FoxPro 2.x project programmatically in Visual FoxPro 5.0 by
running the Convert.app first, as follows:

      DO CONVERT WITH pFileName, pFileType, pVersion, pProgCall
      MODIFY PROJECT pFileName

The following applies to the above code:

 - pFileName. The fully qualified name of file to convert, require character
   type.

 - pFileType. Type of file, require character type, for example: PROJECT.

 - pVersion. Version of file, require character type, for example: 2.6 or 3.0.

 - pProgCall. New parameter--use .T., if CONVERT.APP is being called from within
   another program or application.

Here is an example:

      DO Convert WITH "c:\FPW26\OLD.PJX", "PROJECT", "2.6", .T.
      MODIFY PROJECT c:\FPW26\OLD.PJX

NOTE: In the DO CONVERT command above the word "PROJECT" must be capitalized.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a FoxPro 2.6 or Visual FoxPro 3.0 project called "Old.pjx" (without
   the quotation marks).

2. In Visual FoxPro 5.0 create a .prg file and put the following code the .prg
   file:

         SET TALK OFF
         MODIFY PROJECT C:\FPW26\OLD.PJX

3. Run the program.
