PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when opening an attachment in a
e-mail message:

   A temporary file needed for this action could not be created.

CAUSE
=====

This error may occur if the Temp directory specified by the SET TEMP= statement
does not exist on the hard disk drive or is set to an incorrect directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps for Win9.x clients:

1. Verify that the Autoexec.bat file contains the following line: SET
   TEMP=<tempdir> where <tempdir> is the name of a valid directory
   on your hard disk drive.

2. Verify that the <tempdir> directory specified in Step 1 exists. If it
   does not exist, create the directory.

3. Make sure there is enough disk space available on the hard disk to store the
   attachment.

To work around this problem for Windows NT clients, perform the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click System.

2. Click the Environment tab.

3. Check the Temp Variable in the User Variables section. If that directory does
   not exist, create the directory.

4. Make sure there is enough disk space available on the hard disk to store the
   attachment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you open an attachment in Exchange Server, the file is stored in the
directory specified by the SET TEMP= statement. If this directory does not
exist, or there is not enough available disk space on the hard drive, Exchange
Server may have problems opening the attachment.
