MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Word 97 for Windows you can view a document in Online Layout View.
This new document view makes it easier to read the document on the screen. When
you use the Online Layout View, text appears larger and wraps to fit the window
and is not displayed the way it prints.

Online Layout View allows you to format the background color of the document
window to make it easier to present and read the document. The background color
does not print with the document. The view also allows you to apply text
borders.

To apply a border style, use the following steps:

1. Select the text around which you want to place a border.

2. On the Format menu, click Borders and Shading.

3. Under Style:, click the border style you want and click OK.
