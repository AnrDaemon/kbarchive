======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Project Manager is docked (that is, dragged by the title bar to the
toolbar row of the Visual FoxPro desktop so that only the tabs of the Project
Manager are visible) and a tab is open, the mouse pointer does not appear to
function correctly if you use it to resize the Visual FoxPro desktop. When the
pointer is positioned at the right edge of the Visual FoxPro desktop, it does
not change into a "resizing" pointer.

CAUSE
=====

The tabs of the Project Manager are really pop-up menus. When a pop-up menu,
such as the Data tab, is open, the mouse pointer does not change to a resize
pointer. This is true in other Windows applications as well. For example, click
on any menu in Microsoft Word, keep the menu in the open state, and then try to
resize the desktop window.

WORKAROUND
==========

Click anywhere on either the Visual FoxPro desktop or the Windows desktop. The
pop-up menu closes, and you can use the mouse pointer to resize the Visual
FoxPro desktop. Usually it changes to the multi-headed resize cursor, but if
positioned exactly over the right border of the VFP desktop, it remains an arrow
that can resize the Desktop window.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
