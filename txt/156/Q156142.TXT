The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you execute or debug any stored procedure, the Execute Stored Procedure
dialog box shows the symbol Default even if the procedure does not have default
value parameters.

CAUSE
=====

Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) and SQL Server do not provide a means to
determine if a stored procedure has been defined with default values for
parameters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Execute Stored Procedure dialog box, the values you enter are correctly
passed to the procedure. When you do not enter explicit values and there is no
default value for the parameter, you get an error. For example, the SQL Server
datasource gives the following error:

   37000[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Drier][SQL Server]
   Procedure <name> expects parameter <name> which was not supplied
