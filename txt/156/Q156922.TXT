OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbtool kbui kbvfp kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When disabling a page in a PageFrame object within a container class, the
disabled page from the PageFrame appears enabled when subclassing the container
class.

WORKAROUND
==========

For the disabled page to show up as disabled at run time, put the following code
in the Init event of the disabled page:

      THIS.Enabled = .F.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are creating a container class that has a PageFrame object in it and
you disable a page in the PageFrame, the page that was disabled in the container
class shows up as if it were enabled at design time if you try to subclass the
container class.

However, if you edit the container class and then click on the disabled page, it
disables itself properly but it always appears at first to be enabled.

At run time, the disabled page looks like it is enabled, but you cannot select
the disabled page.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Use the Class Designer to create a container class.

2. Place a PageFrame in the container class and set the PageCount property to 3.

3. Set the Enabled property of the third page to False (.F.).

4. Create a form.

5. Drop the Container class that you just created in the Class Designer onto the
   form.

The disabled page now appears enabled.
