TITLE   :XADM: JET Asserts in ISINTEG During a Check on Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While running ISINTEG in check mode against a database, an assert may occur in
JET (if running the debug build of Edb.dll), or possibly ISINTEG may stop with a
Dr. Watson exception error.


CAUSE
=====

When calculating the weight that moved to new page, it did not count the node
that is bumped by the new node. So when a real split occurs on this page, JET
asserts because there is no space for the split.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With the hotfix,
the calculation was corrected to count the node that is bumped by the new node.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
