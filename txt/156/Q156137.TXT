TITLE   :FIX: Cannot Set Breakpoint at EXECUTE Statement
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDebug kbEEdition kbSQL kbVC kbVC500fix kbSQLProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot set the breakpoint at the EXECUTE statement in a stored procedure.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use EXEC instead of EXECUTE as a workaround to this bug.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This bug was fixed in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The EXEC and EXECUTE statements mean the same in SQL Server 6.5. You can set the
breakpoint at an EXEC statement. But the EXECUTE statement does not accept
breakpoints. However, breakpoints are accepted on both the EXEC and EXECUTE
statements while stepping from the previous statement.

While debugging if you try to set a break point on an EXECUTE line, the
breakpoint gets set on the next line.
