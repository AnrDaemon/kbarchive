The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Unattended Setup with Windows NT 4.0 supports the use of the Uniqueness Database
File (UDF), which provides the ability to specify per-computer parameters. The
functionality of the UDF is to merge or replace specific sections of the answer
file for the GUI portion of setup. The use of the UDF provides a structured and
convenient method for the deployment of Windows NT 4.0 on a large scale.

The information in this article assumes that a working answer file has been
developed for unattended installation of Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The UDF is an ASCII text file created using a simple text editor. The file is
stored with the other Windows NT files on the distribution server.

The UDF is broken down into two sections, the UniqueIDs and the UniqueID
parameters. The UniqueIDs section identifies the Unique ID and the sections of
the answer file that are going to be merged or replaced. The UniqueIDs parameter
is the actual data that will be merged or replaced in the answer file.

Example 1
---------

In this example, two Unique IDs have been created: UserID1 and UserID2. UserID1
and UserID2 will have Userdata, GuiUnattended, and Network sections that will
merge or replace the corresponding sections in the answer file.

      [UniqueIDs]
         UserID1 = Userdata,GuiUnattended,Network
         UserID2 = Userdata,GuiUnattended,Network

In the next section of the UDF, Unique ID sections are identified by using the
Unique ID and the section name, separated by a colon.

Example 2
---------

In this example, the Userdata, GuiUnattended, and Network sections will be merged
into the answer file. See the sample Unattend.txt file at the end of this
article as a reference.

      [UniqueIDs]
         UserID1 = Userdata,GuiUnattended,Network
         UserID2 = Userdata,GuiUnattended,Network

      [UserID1:UserData]
      FullName = "User ID-1"
      ComputerName = "MACHINE-1"

      [UserID1:GuiUnattended]
      TimeZone = " (GMT-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)"

      [UserID1:Network]
      JoinDomain = "DomainEast"

      [UserID2:UserData]
      FullName = "User ID-2"
      ComputerName = "MACHINE-2"

      [UserID2:GuiUnattended]
      TimeZone = "(GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada)"

      [UserID2:Network]
      JoinDomain = "DomainCentral"

Merging of this unique information occurs during the execution of Winnt.exe or
Winnt32.exe. To invoke the UDF file, use the following command-line options:

/u:answer_file /s:NT_Source /t:temp_drive /UDF:UniqueID,local_name_of_udf

Example:

winnt /u:answ.txt /s:z:\ /t:c: /udf:userid1,z:\udf.txt
