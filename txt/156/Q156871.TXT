TITLE   :DOCERR: Visual FoxPro 5.0 AFIELDS() Remark Help Topic Outdated
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The first paragraph of the Remarks section of the Help topic "AFIELDS()"
describes the array generated by the AFIELDS() function as containing 11 columns
and as many rows as there are fields in the table. The correct number of columns
for Visual FoxPro 5.0 is 16.

The statement in the Remarks section is a duplicate of the Help topic paragraph
found in Visual FoxPro version 3.0b. However, it contradicts the information in
the Arguments section of the AFIELDS() topic, which describes the elements of
the array.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The AFIELDS() function of Microsoft Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows provides more
information about the structure of a table than was available previously. The
resulting array contains five additional columns recording the following:

   Column 12 - the long file name of the table
   Column 13 - any 'Insert' trigger expression
   Column 14 - any 'Update' trigger expression
   Column 15 - any 'Delete' trigger expression
   Column 16 - any table comment
