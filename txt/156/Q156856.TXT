The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail and Hangul Mail, the Korean version of Microsoft Mail and also
known as Hmail, 3.5 Postoffices (POs) can contain Korean characters in MMFs and
Shared Folders. When these POs are migrated to a Microsoft Exchange Server
running on Korean Windows NT 3.51, the correct Msfs32.dll should be placed in
the \%SystemRoot%\System32 directory. Otherwise, the Korean characters in the
Public Folders that have been migrated from the PO's Shared Folders will be
corrupted. The selection of the correct Msfs32.dll is documented in the release
notes, Read_cl2.wri, on the Korean Microsoft Exchange Client CD-ROM and this
article covers that process in more detail.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two Msfs32.dll files; U.S. and Korean. The U.S. version is shipped on
the Microsoft Exchange Server CD-ROM in the \Setup\I386 directory and is copied
to the Windows NT System32 directory when the Microsoft Exchange Server is
installed. The Korean version is shipped on the Korean Microsoft Exchange Client
CD-ROM and is included in one of the cabinet files (Exchng5.cab in Microsoft
Exchange version 4.0) in the \Kor\Winnt\I386 or \Kor\Win95 directories. In order
to extract this file, use the Extract utility that is shipped with Windows 95.

Both versions should be copied to the \%SystemRoot%\System32 directory when you
migrate to Microsoft Exchange Server. The U.S. version when you migrate from
Microsoft Mail and the Korean version when you migrate from Hangul Mail.
