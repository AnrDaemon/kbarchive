The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

An Excel code example under the section titled "Controlling Visual FoxPro from
Other Applications" in Chapter 16 of the Visual FoxPro 5.0 Online Documentation
needs modification to work.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following incorrect code from the Online Documentation demonstrates how
Excel might use Visual FoxPro as a server:

      Sub FoxTest()
         Dim oFox as Object
         Set oFox = CreateObject("VisualFoxPro.Application")

         oFox.DoCmd "USE customer"
         oFox.DoCmd "SELECT contact, phone FROM customer
           WHERE country = " + Chr$(39) + USA+ Chr$(39) + " INTO CURSOR cust"
         oFox.DataToClip "cust",,3
         Range("A1:B1").Select
         ActiveSheet.Paste
      End Sub

Make the following changes to the Online Documentation example:

1. Add the following line before 'oFox.DoCmd "USE customer"':

         oFox.DoCmd "SET DEFAULT TO HOME()+ '\samples\data'"

2. The WHERE clause has to be on the same line with the SELECT. Make sure the
   Excel editor does not place any extra characters in this line.

3. Add the following line before 'Range("A1:B1").Select' :

         ActiveWorkbook.Sheets(2).Activate
