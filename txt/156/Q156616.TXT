The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run PaintIt! from within Creative Writer 2 and modify the dimensions of a
graphic image, the new dimensions are not maintained when you return to Creative
Writer 2.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to work around this issue. Try one of the following.

Resize the Picture Within Creative Writer 2
-------------------------------------------

1. Click the image to select it.

2. Resize the image. You can do this by moving the mouse over one of the handles
   (the black squares surrounding the image). The mouse cursor will turn into
   two arrows pointing away from each other. Drag the arrow in the direction you
   want to resize the image.

   NOTE: Hold down the SHIFT key while dragging to size the object
   proportionally.

Run PaintIt! as a Standalone Application
----------------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Kids, and click PaintIt!

2. Draw your image, and give it the dimensions you desire.

3. Save your image to a location that you will remember.

4. Return to (or start) Creative Writer 2.

5. Click the Picture menu, and then click the Picture Picker.

6. Click the Open button in the lower-left corner of the Picture Picker dialog
   box.

7. Find and open your picture.

8. Click your picture in the preview window of the Picture Picker.

9. Click OK.
