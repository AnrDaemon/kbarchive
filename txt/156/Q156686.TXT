You may receive the following error when trying to reconnect to any Novell
Server connection under File Manager from a computer running Windows NT
Workstation 3.5x:

   SYSTEM ERROR 85 HAS OCCURRED:
   The local device name is already in use.

CAUSE
=====

If you install Client Services for NetWare on a computer running Windows NT

that computer, you may receive the above error when you attempt to reconnect to
NetWare resources. File Manager will show the connection as unavailable.
However, when you log out and log back on with the same account, the connections
are no longer unavailable but are now valid.

Also, if you log on locally and remap the drives, the connections are no longer
unavailable.

RESOLUTION

 - Log off and log back on with the same user account.

 - Go to Control Panel Services tool and disable the Cheyenne InocuLAN Anti-
   Virus Server service. Check with Cheyenne for version updates that may not
   cause this problem.
