TITLE   :XCON: WAN Drive Functionality of PC Connector and ISDN Lines
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q140186 describes how to configure the
Microsoft Exchange MS Mail Connector (PC) MTA to have WAN drive functionality.
However the Microsoft Exchange PC Mail connector does not completely silence the
connection to the remote Postoffice (PO). A network trace shows SMB traffic
between Microsoft Exchange and the remote PO. The MS Mail Connector service
verifies that the link is alive by performing a directory listing at the
interval specified by the Check for Mail Every option. However, with the Do not
Pick Up Mail at This Postoffice option checked, the service should only connect
to the remote PO when there is mail to send from Microsoft Exchange. This can
mean problems for customers who use ISDN lines because the line will stay active
continuously.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
