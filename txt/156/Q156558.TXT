======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for Windows 1997 edition 
 - Microsoft Music Central for Windows 1997 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a web link in one of the Microsoft products listed at the top of
this article, your web browser does not automatically start. You may receive an
error message similar to the following:

   Your browser could not be launched. Close any open applications and try
   again. If nothing else is open, re-install your browser and try again.

This occurs when you are using Netscape Navigator version 2.0 as your browser.

CAUSE
=====

Netscape Navigator 2.0 does not register itself with Windows 95 for the type of
access used by these programs. Special registration is needed to allow Windows
95 programs to automatically start a web browser.

RESOLUTION
==========

Download Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 or 3.0, which installs universal
Internet settings for Windows 95. The latest editions of Internet Explorer are
available on the Microsoft web site at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/ie

After you install Internet Explorer version 2.0 or newer, Windows 95 can
automatically start your default web browser, including Netscape Navigator. The
first time you run Internet Explorer, it will ask if you wish to set it as your
default web browser. If you wish to continue using Netscape Navigator as your
default web browser, be sure to click No.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Internet Explorer Setup installs universal Internet settings for Windows 95. By
changing the properties of the Internet icon on your desktop, you can configure
Dial-up settings, proxy connections and other options for basic Internet
access.
