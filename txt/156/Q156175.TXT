KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Next button in step 4 of the Setup Wizard is disabled.

CAUSE
=====

The "Setup dialog box caption" and "Copyright information" are required entries
in step 4 of the Setup Wizard.

RESOLUTION
==========

Enter a setup dialog box caption and copyright information in the boxes
provided. There must be at least one alphabetic or numeric character in each for
the Next button to become enabled.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is documented in the Help topic accessed with the Help button in the bottom
left corner of the step 4 dialog box. Following is the Help text:

   The Setup Wizard creates installation dialog boxes with the title you specify
   in the Setup dialog box caption box. It also places the copyright statement
   in the Copyright information dialog box that the user can access from the
   About command on the Setup application's control menu. The Post-setup
   executable entry is optional.

   NOTE: In order to advance to step 5, you must move the insertion point outside
   the Setup dialog box caption and Copyright information boxes.
