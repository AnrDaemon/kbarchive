TITLE   :Names Disappear from Name List in Directory Auditing Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the File Auditing or Directory Auditing window of File Manager, a list of
users or groups is added to the Name window. One or more items in the Events to
Audit window are selected for success or failure. When you click OK, security is
applied to the selected objects and the Auditing window closes. Upon reentering
the Auditing window, only one or some of the users or groups on the Names list
are retained. The rest have disappeared from the list.

CAUSE
=====

Each name entered on the Names list must be selected individually, and one or
more events to be audited must be selected for that entry. Repeat this procedure
for each listed name. Names for which no events have been selected will
disappear when you click the OK button to exit the Directory Auditing window.
This is expected behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

Select each name in the Name window individually and select at least one event
to audit for success or failure.

Additional query words: audit prodnt
