TITLE   :Device Failure Message with Microchannel Network Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbnetwork kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows NT on a computer with a microchannel (MCA) network
adapter, you may receive the following error message:

   At least one service or driver failed during system startup.
   Use Event Viewer to examine the event log for details.

When you look at the event log, you see the following entry:

   Event ID: 7000
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Description: A device connected to the system is not functioning.


After you log on to the computer, you may have no network access through one or
more of the microchannel network adapters.

CAUSE
=====

The MCA Setup program and the adapter's Oemsetup.inf file identify the slots on
an MCA bus differently than the Windows NT hardware abstraction layer (HAL). The
Windows NT HAL identifies the slots beginning with 0 (for example, physical slot
1 is SlotID 0), but the MCA setup program and the Oemsetup.inf file start with
1.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been fixed in the file NDIS.SYS contained in Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 2.0 and later service packs.

If after applying Service Pack-2 you still have the failure please refer to
Knowledge base article:
