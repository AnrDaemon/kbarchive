SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Schedule+ to create an appointment and invite others, you
might receive a Microsoft Exchange non-delivery report (NDR). The NDR states
that a recipient could not be reached even though that recipient was not listed
as an attendee.

CAUSE
=====

One of the invited attendees is configured to have a delegate and has specified
that all meeting requests be sent to that delegate. If the delegate's mailbox
has been deleted, an NDR will be sent to the meeting originator.

This behavior is by design because the meeting request is being sent to a mailbox
that no longer exists.
