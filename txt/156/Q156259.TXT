======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Wacom Tablet with Windows NT 4.0, you may experience any of
the following symptoms:

 - The tablet driver (Wacomkey.exe) does not exit properly when Windows NT shuts
   down.

 - You receive an application error while attempting to open the Wacom tool in
   Control Panel.

 - The event log fills up with overflow messages.

CAUSE
=====

Older versions of Wacom's tablet drivers can cause these problems, as they are
not designed to operate with Windows NT 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact Wacom for updated versions of the drivers. The drivers are also
available on Wacom's Web site at http://www.wacom.com.
