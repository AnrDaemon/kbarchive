SYMPTOMS
========

When calling CRecordset::Edit() followed by CRecordset::Update() to update an
image field in a snapshot recordset, you may receive the following errors:

   Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'UPDATE'.
   State:37000,Native:156,Origin:[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver] [SQL
   Server]

   Line 1: Incorrect syntax near '='.
   State:37000,Native:170,Origin:[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver] [SQL Server]

CAUSE
=====

There is a bug in the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver version 2.65.0201, which
ships with Visual C++ version 4.2.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade your SQL Server ODBC driver to version 2.65.0213, which comes with
Microsoft Visual C++, Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 or with the Service Pack 1
for Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs only when the cursor library is loaded and the recordset is
opened as a snapshot. Dynasets without the cursor library do not display this
problem.
