TITLE   :STOP: 0x0000000A During Client Socket Disconnect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A computer running Windows NT 3.51 Server running client/server-based
applications may result in a Blue Screen when the processing client socket
disconnects. You may see an error message such as:

   STOP: 0x0000000A (0x000020b5, 0x00000002, 0x00000001, 0x8010da81)
   IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

NOTE: The first parameter may differ, but the fourth parameter will be the same
on a uniprocessor system.

CAUSE
=====

This problem has been identified in the Afd.sys driver. For instance, the NwLink
Nwlnkspx.sys driver makes a reference to close a connection, and AFD
dereferences the connection and sets the counter to zero. However, in certain
instances Afd.sys does not handle the dereference properly and Afd.sys later
tries to dereference the connection object again. This causes the machine to
stop.


RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the hotfix mentioned below. This problem does not occur under Windows NT
version 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
