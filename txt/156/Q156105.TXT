TITLE   :XCLN: Viewing Other Attendees after Accepting Meeting Request
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0; Win95:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you have already accepted a Microsoft Schedule+ Meeting Request, you cannot
view other Attendees by using the Attendees tab when viewing the meeting
details. Only the Originator of a Meeting Request can see the attendees using
this tab.


WORKAROUND
==========

There are two workarounds for this problem.

The first workaround is for the originator of the Meeting Request to give READ
access privileges on their schedule to everyone who is invited to the meeting.
This can also be done by setting the Default access privilege to READ privileges
or higher. The attendees would then log into the originator's schedule to view
the meeting. They should open the File menu, click Open, click Other's
Appointment Book, and enter the originator's alias. This will display the
originator's appointment book details. The attendee can then locate the
appointment, double-click on it to display the appointment dialog box, and
select the Attendee's tab to view who will be or will not be attending.

Note: This will create additional network traffic. Also, this cannot be set per
meeting. This is set for the entire schedule.

The second workaround is for the attendee to keep the original Meeting Request
message. Although this will not show who will actually be attending, it will
show the original list of people invited to attend the meeting. This won't work
for anyone who automatically accepts meeting requests because the message is
automatically deleted by the system. It might also be an incomplete list if the
originator invites other people in another message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 7.0 of Microsoft
Schedule+. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
