TITLE   :STOP Message when IBM Warp Client Connects to Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When IBM OS/2 Warp network clients connect to Windows NT 4.0, the Server service
may fail with the following Blue Screen Trap data:

   STOP: 0x0000000A (0x00002EE8, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0x8013A804)

CAUSE
=====

The OS/2 network redirector still uses the server message block (SMB) Write
Block Multiplexed (SMB MPX) to send larger amounts of data. Windows NT 4.0 does
not correctly respond to this SMB and causes the server to fail.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMB MPX comes into play when OS/2 is trying to send data from two processes over
the same network connection at the same time (multiplexing).

Windows NT does not support this SMB on connection-based traffic. Instead, when
the server receives a request with SMB MPX, it responds with a message telling
the client to switch back to standard SMB Writes. The client will switch modes
and keep on working with no problems.

Network performance studies have shown that SMB Raw Mode Reads and Writes provide
better performance than MPX. This is why it is not supported under Windows NT.

There is one exception to this, however. Windows NT does support SMB MPX when
using IPX Direct Hosting. Direct hosting is only available with Microsoft
clients, so it does not come affect OS/2 interoperability. However, the Windows
NT 4.0 failure occurs when the client is told to switch to standard SMB Write.
The functions to send the response back to the client do not fully account for
IPX and non-IPX clients.
