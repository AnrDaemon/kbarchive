SUMMARY
=======

In Visual FoxPro 3.0, when the ControlSource property of a combo box or list box
evaluates to a numeric value, the ControlSource property stores the index number
(position) in the list instead of the actual numeric value that is displayed.
However, a new property named BoundTo has been introduced in Visual FoxPro 5.0
to solve this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The RowSource property of a combo box or list box specifies the source of the
values; that is, it indicates where the data is coming from.

The ControlSource property of a combo box specifies the data that is modified
when a selection is made. It indicates where the data is going to.

When a combo box or a list box is bound to a ControlSource property with
character data type, the character value is stored to the ControlSource property
as it shows in the list. However, if it is bound to a ControlSource property
with numeric data, the numeric value stores differently, depending on the
setting of the BoundTo property. Below is a step-by-step example that shows you
how to store the actual numeric value to the ControlSource property of a combo
box or a list box:

1. Create a new form.

2. On the View menu, click Data Environment and add the \Samples\Data\Orditems
   table to the DataEnvironment object. In Visual FoxPro 6.0, the Orditems table
   can be found in home(2)+"Data".

3. Add a combo box control to the new form, then set combo box properties as
   follows:

         RowSource = 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100
         RowSourceType = 1-Value
         ControlSource = orditems.quantity
         BoundTo = .T.

4. Save and Run the form.

Now, when you click any item in the combo box, the actual numeric value stores to
the quantity field. You can verify this by browsing the orditems table while you
are making changes to the combo box.

However, if you set the BoundTo property to .F., the index number (position) of
the list is stored to the quantity field instead.
