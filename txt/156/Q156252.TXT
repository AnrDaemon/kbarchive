 - Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In The Magic School Bus Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs, when you create a Past
Card containing a long text string, individual characters in the text string may
be truncated.

Text strings that are 16-25 characters long without spaces (for example,
"1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKL"), display this behavior. The text appears correctly as
long as the text box is highlighted.

When you click the right text box to shift focus, the characters on the right
side of the left text box are truncated.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only way to prevent truncation is to use shorter text strings so the line
breaks move the text to the next line.
