SUMMARY
=======

FrontPage Editor does not support the addition of "border=0" to the extended
attributes of a table.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The proposed HTML 3.2 specification states the following:

   The attributes on TABLE are all optional. By default, the table is rendered
   without a surrounding border.

Therefore the "border=0" attribute is not necessary.

When Netscape Navigator encounters a table without a border attribute, it
separates the cells in the table by a space sufficient to render a 1 pixel
border. This may be a problem when you attempt to align images within a table.
The "border=0" attribute is required to allow images to be aligned flush against
each other in Netscape Navigator. This is not required in Microsoft Internet
Explorer.

For more information about the proposed HTML 3.2 specification, please see the
