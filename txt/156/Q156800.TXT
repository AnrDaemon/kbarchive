TITLE   :SFM Primary Group Show
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view Services For Macintosh (SFM) Volume and Directory Permissions, the
primary group account is listed as <Account Unknown>. Macintosh clients
may report being unable to connect to Windows NT volumes, or unable to access
some directories within the volume.


CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT Server computer is set up as a stand-alone server, and has been
moved from a domain to a workgroup. By default, when a SFM volume is created,
the primary group is set to the domain users group. When the server is moved to
a workgroup, the domain accounts are no longer available, and the primary group
will not choose another group without administrator intervention.

RESOLUTION
==========

An administrator will have to modify the Volume and Directory permissions for
the Macintosh volume to set the primary group to an existing group.

Additional query words: sfm blank empty
