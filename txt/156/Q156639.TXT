TITLE   :PRB: Using Date Function Code in @...GET Does Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 3.0, you are allowed to use the Date function code ("D") in the
@...GET statement to input a date. However, in Visual FoxPro 5.0, the Date
function code is not working any longer.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Execute the following program:

      dDate = DATE()
      @ 1,1 GET dDate PICTURE "D"
      READ

NOTE: The date will show up in a GET field, but you are only allowed to type in
the first character in the date field. If you try to type in the second
character, you will receive an "Invalid Date" error.
