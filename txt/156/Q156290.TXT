TITLE   :XCLN Forms Designer Hangs Attempting To Install Project File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer (EFD) project
file (*.efp file), the computer may stop responding, or a general protection
fault (GPF) may occur. The only way to get back into Exchange Forms Designer at
this point is to end task from Task Manager and restart.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs during the project installation and compile processand is
due to an out of memory error. The out of memory error is caused in turn by the
number of controls placed on and Exchange Form during design time. The number of
controls is not limited during design time but the number that can be present
while installing or compiling an Exchange Forms Project file is limited to a
number between 80 to 120. This number varies due to the different memory
requirements of each control.

WORKAROUND
==========

Before installing, limit the number of controls present in an Exchange Forms
project file to approximately 80 controls.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange versions 4.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
