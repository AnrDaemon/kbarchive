The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When creating web pages within Creative Writer, you may choose from the standard
set of point sizes, including "Other Size." Only seven levels of character sizes
are allowable in HTML. Regardless of the point sizes chosen within your web
document, once the document is converted to an HTML document, the character
point sizes are converted into one of the seven standard character sizes for
HTML.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The web page creation wizard utilizes the same interface as the normal Creative
Writer word processor. For this reason, all point sizes appear within the
drop-down list.

NOTE: It is helpful to be aware of HTML standards such as the seven allowable
point sizes to understand the apparent discrepancies between your created
document and your HTML document.
