TITLE   :Problems Saving Event Viewer Log from Windows NT 4.0 to 3.51
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It is not possible to remotely save the Event Viewer log from a Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 computer, to a Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 computer.

CAUSE
=====

The way file names are referenced was changed in Windows NT 4.0. In Windows NT
4.0, file names are referenced internally as \??, instead of as \DosDevices, as
they are referenced in Windows NT version 3.51.

RESOLUTION
==========

Advapi32.dll was modified to retry saving the file using the Windows NT 3.51
method of referencing the file when it fails using the Windows NT 4.0 method.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
