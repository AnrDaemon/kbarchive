TITLE   :PRB: Copy, Paste Shortcuts Work Only When Edit Menu Present
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00 3.00b 5.00

KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a program replaces the Visual FoxPro System Menu bar with a menu bar that
does not contain an Edit menu pad, the shortcut keys to cut, copy, and paste
(CTRL+X, CTRL+C and CTRL+V) no longer perform those functions.

CAUSE
=====

Because the current system menu has no Edit pad, there will be no edit functions
for the application at the time.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Shortcut keys are defined within a menu and enabled when that menu is loaded.
While the CTRL+X, CTRL+C, and CTRL+V are used by most Windows applications as
the shortcuts to cut, copy, and paste, they accomplish those functions only as
menu pop-up bar shortcuts. If the system menu has no Edit pad or other edit
functionality, those shortcut keys will not be available.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

In the Visual FoxPro for Windows Help file topic for [ASCII 147]Activate
Popup,[ASCII 148] there is a sample program named Actipop.prg that modifies the
default menu and demonstrates that the editing shortcut functionality no longer
functions.

1. Copy the code for the Actipop.prg file from the Help file example.

2. Paste the code in a program file of the same name. Set the default path to
   the directory where this file is saved.

3. Run it with the program file visible and note that the system menu changes.

4. Click any text shown in the program editing window.

5. Try to use the clipboard features (CTRL+C,X,V) by cutting or copying the
   selected text from one part of the open window to another.

6. To restore your system menu, type the following commands in the Command
   window:

         SET SYSMENU NOSAVE
         SET SYSMENU TO DEFAULT
