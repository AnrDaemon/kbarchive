The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you print a card from within Creative Writer 2, the print settings
dialog box indicates that four (4) pages will print. However, only one
page, the foldable card, will actually print.

Creative Writer logically maps four (4) pages of graphics and text onto one
(1) real page. Essentially, four pages are printed, reduced, and rotated as
necessary onto one 8.5 x 11 inch piece of paper. The print settings dialog
box is reflecting the four pages mapped to the one foldable card page.
