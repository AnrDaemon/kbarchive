TITLE   :Memory-Related Performance Counters Show Zero Values
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add one of the following counters of the Server service to your
Performance Monitor view on Windows NT Server 4.0, you will see that the
counters are always zero, even though the Server service always allocates some
memory:

   Pool Nonpaged Bytes
   Pool Nonpaged Failures
   Pool Nonpaged Peak
   Pool Paged Bytes
   Pool Paged Failures
   Pool Paged Peak

If you check the Performance Monitor with Windows NT Server 3.51, or Windows NT
Workstation 3.51 or 4.0, you will always receive nonzero values.

CAUSE
=====

The server does not track the amount of memory allocated when it is allowed to
allocate an infinite amount of memory. This is always the case for Windows NT
Server.
