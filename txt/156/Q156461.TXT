The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When creating a banner with Creative Writer version 2.0, you will notice that
all pages display the same margins as specified within the program. This results
in large white spaces between letters on a printed banner.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Since margins are selected for each page within the banner and not for the
entire banner, the amount of white space between pages must be controlled
directly by the left and right margin sizes selected within the program.

Some printers have smaller minimum enforceable margins than others. For example,
banner's printed on the HP DeskJet, have a margin of at least 0.25 inches.
