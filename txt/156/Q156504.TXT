TITLE   :PRB: Intellidrop from View into Designer Causes Requeries
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Each time you drag and drop a field from a View to a Form or Report, the View is
requeried.

CAUSE
=====

The information for the view is not cached; it is dynamically retrieved as
needed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Issue the USE command to open the view first. Then when you drag and drop
fields, Intellidrop is able to get the information from the view that is already
open.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open the Testdata database in the Visual FoxPro Samples\Data folder.

2. Create a new report.

3. In the DataEnvironment of the report, add the Invoice view from the Testdata
   database.

4. Drag a field from the view in the DataEnvironment to the Report Design
   Surface.

5. Drag another field from the view in the DataEnvironment to the Report Design
   Surface.

When the first field is dragged, the view is prompted for a dStart_Date and
dEnd_Date. When the second field is dragged, the view is prompted to the same
query again.

Here are the steps to a workaround for the above example:

1. Open the Testdata database in the Visual FoxPro Samples\Data folder.

2. In the Command window type USE Invoice to open the view.(You are prompted for
   a dStart_Date and dEnd_Date.)

3. Create a new Report.

4. In the DataEnvironment of the Report, add the Invoice view from the TESTDATA
   Database.

5. Drag a field from the view in the DataEnvironment to the Report Design
   Surface. Drag another field from the view in the DataEnvironment to the
   Report.

The view does not prompt for the query again and again as shown in the above
example.

NOTE: The dialog box prompts for a Date type value. If you enter the date as a
text string "07/01/93" (without the quotation marks) an "Operator/operand type
mismatch" error is received. You must enter the dates in the following manner:
{07/01/93}
