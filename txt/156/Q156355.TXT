TITLE   :XADM: IS Incorrectly Handles a Forward Slash in DDA Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using a one-off X400 address to send a message from a Microsoft Exchange
user to a Microsoft Mail recipient (that is, an address in the form "c=us;a=
;p=ms;o=EX1; dda:ms=ms/po1/admin"), the Information Store produces a nondelivery
report (NDR) back to the sender.

CAUSE
=====

The Information Store incorrectly parses the single forward slash as an address
delimiter, thereby causing the address to seem invalid.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do either of the following:

 - Use double forward slashes between the portions of the Microsoft Mail address
   included in the DDA value.

-or-

 - Obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With the hotfix, the Information Store
   handles the single forward slash in the DDA value correctly, and the address
   is parsed correctly and sent to the intended recipient.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Exchange Server 4.0 and 5.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
