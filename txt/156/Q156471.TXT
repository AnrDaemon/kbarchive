SYMPTOMS
========

In Creative Writer 2, print jobs may spool to very large files. This can slow
down printing, or even halt the printing process entirely.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are several factors to consider in the spooling of a print job:

 - Decrease printer dpi. The dpi of the printer affects the complexity, and
   therefore size of the spooled file.

 - Decrease color depth. The video driver in use affects complexity; higher
   color depths increase spool files.

 - Decrease complexity. Multiple stickers, backgrounds, and/or borders increase
   the complexity of a document spool file.

 - Increase free hard disk space. Hard disk space can be consumed by spool
   files. On machines with little free hard disk space, more complex documents
   may not print.

Creative Writer 2 creates very large spool files by design. Use the steps
outlined above to avoid difficulties when printing.
