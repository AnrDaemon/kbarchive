TITLE   :Upgrading WinNT 3.51 to 4.0 w/ NCR/Symbios Logic Controller
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade from Windows NT version 3.51 to Windows NT version 4.0 with a
NCR C810 SCSI controller, you may receive the following error message:

   STOP 0X0000001E KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT 4.0 upgrade installs the Symc810.sys driver in place of Symbios
Logic's Windows NT 3.51 Symc8xx.sys driver. The Windows NT 3.51 version of the
driver is not removed during the upgrade, which causes a conflict with the new
driver. This conflict does not occur if you install Windows NT 4.0 directly
without upgrading.

RESOLUTION
==========

Prior to upgrading, use the Windows NT Setup program to remove the Symbios Logic
PCI (53c8XX) SCSI adapter driver and add the NCR PCI (53c810) adapter driver
included with the Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 compact disc. This process installs
the Microsoft Ncrc810.sys driver. Then perform the Windows NT 4.0 upgrade as
normal.

Some systems will not function with the Ncrc810.sys driver. Owners of those
systems that can't use the Microsoft provided Ncrc810.sys driver, or users that
have upgraded Windows NT with the Symcxx.sys driver in place, should contact
Symbios Logic for technical support. Symbios Logic's technical support can be
reached at (719) 533-7230.
