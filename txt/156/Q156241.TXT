======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The OLE Container Control and OLE Bound Control have a new property called
AutoVerbMenu, which allows you to specify whether a pop-up menu appears when the
user right-clicks an OLE object in a running form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The list of items on the pop-up menu are the verbs supplied by the server. They
are the same ones you see when Object is clicked on the Edit menu.

Steps to Demonstrate
--------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add an OLE Container Control to the form.

3. Select Microsoft Excel Worksheet in the Insert Object dialog box.

4. Enter some data and deactivate the Excel object.

5. With the Excel object selected, click Worksheet Object on the Edit menu. The
   Edit and Open menu options appear.

6. Set the AutoVerbMenu and Enabled properties for the object to .T. - True.

7. Run the form and right-click the worksheet.

The same items (Edit, Open) that are available on the Edit menu are available to
the user of your form when they right-click the worksheet object.
