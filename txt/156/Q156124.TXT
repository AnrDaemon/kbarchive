SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail directory synchronization, the Import utility can be used to
create a Resync.glb file. This file can then be used to resynchronize the
requestor with the dir-sync server (DSS) by replacing the sync numbers and the
address lists on the Microsoft Mail Requestor Postoffice with the copy the DSS
maintains.

You can use this file with an Exchange Requestor by placing it in the Dxadata
directory and stopping and starting the Directory Synchronization service. This
will populate the Exchange import containers with the Microsoft Mail addresses
and resynchronize the Requestor Sync numbers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Resync.glb can be created in the Maildata\glb subdirectory on the Microsoft Mail
dir sync server postoffice by carrying out:

   Import -s admin -p[password] -d[drive]

Resync.glb is typically used to troubleshoot the dir-sync process. It contains
both the sync numbers (as the DSS sees them), and the actual addresses stored by
the DSS.

NOTE: After creating Resync.glb with the import utility, this file must be
removed from the Maildata\glb directory on the DSS. If you do not remove this
file, it may cause problems with the Global Address List of the DSS.
