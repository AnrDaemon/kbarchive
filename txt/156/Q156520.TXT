TITLE   :Logon Validation Fails Using Domain Name Server (DNS)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Domain Name System (DNS) as your primary name server, domain
validation fails. You receive an informational dialog box stating that no domain
controller could be found in the domain to validate your user account.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 does not recognize any names other than the 0 x
20 name for DNS name resolution requests. A Microsoft Windows NT client using
DNS is not able to find a domain controller since the 0 x 1c Internet group name
is required for domain validation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Netbt.sys was modified to parse the NetBIOS Node Status response for the NetBIOS
name requested, rather than just the 0 x 20 name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In a DNS-only environment, Microsoft Windows NT sends a NetBIOS Node Status
request to the IP address returned by the DNS server. When the client receives
the NetBIOS Node Status response back, it parses all the registered NetBIOS
names in the response to determine if the requested NetBIOS name is registered
on the remote computer. If the requested name is registered on the remote
computer, it adds the name and IP address to the remote hash table. Windows NT
version 4.0 only looks for the 0 x 20 name in the NetBIOS Node Status response.
