SUMMARY
=======

If you create a stripe set with Disk Administrator under Microsoft Windows NT,
there is no way to extend the size of the stripe set after its creation.

Microsoft Windows NT implements disk striping, which increases disk performance.
Windows NT Server also adds the ability to create fault tolerant stripe sets
with parity. In either case, the stripe sets are created as a fixed size, using
free space on the selected disks.

The smallest amount of free space from the selected disks will be used as a
common partition size. As a result of the fixed size limitations, stripe sets
may not be extended beyond their original size without deleting and re-creating
the stripe set. If you decide to create a larger stripe set, you should first
back up all valuable information from the stripe set before deleting it, because
deleting a stripe set causes all data within it to be lost.
