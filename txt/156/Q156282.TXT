KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a Microsoft Schedule+ 7.0 meeting request to a Microsoft Schedule+
1.0 user who is configured with an assistant, the 1.0 assistant can accept the
meeting request but will receive an Non-Delivery Report (NDR) on the accept
message response.

If the user responds to the meeting request, the message will not NDR. This only
happens if the assistant responds.

WORKAROUND
==========

When the assistant receives the NDR, they should click the Resend button and
forward that message to the correct address.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an example of the NDR message:
