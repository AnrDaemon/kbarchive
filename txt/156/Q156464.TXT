The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print graphics from Creative Writer 2, you may get unexpected results.
If you are printing to a PostScript printer, such as an HP LaserJet IIIsi,
pictures may print as black splotches, masking all graphic detail.

RESOLUTION
==========

Try one of the following resolutions:

Method 1
--------

To work around this problem, use a non-PostScript printer driver for your
printer.

Many PostScript laser printers support more than one printing mode; try using a
printer driver for another mode of your printer. For example, use an HP PCL
driver with an HP LaserJet PostScript printer rather than a PostScript driver.
This should correct any difficulties you are having and may improve the printing
speed as well.

Refer to your printer manufacturer or printer documentation for more information
regarding printer drivers for your particular printer.

Method 2
--------

A second resolution is to identify an emulation printer driver for your printer.
(For example, a Canon Bubblejet 4000 would use the Epson LQ 2550 emulation
driver.)
