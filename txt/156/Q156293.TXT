TITLE   :XCLN: Macintosh Spelling Checker Could Not Be Started Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the spelling checker in the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client,
the following error message appears:

   The spelling operation could not be completed. The spelling checker could not
   be started. Some components are either missing or incorrectly configured in
   your Win.ini file. See your administrator.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program for the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client does not correctly
install the English and Custom dictionaries when more than one hard disk is
present.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy both the English and Custom Dictionary files from the Microsoft folder to
the Microsoft Exchange folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Macintosh has more than one hard disk drive and it also has a Microsoft
application (such as Office) with a spelling checker feature that is not
installed on the startup drive, the Exchange client installs OK but the problem
occurs during spelling check operations.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 4.0, of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 4.0
