SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro 5.0 has a new WordWrap property for command buttons that allows
you to create command buttons with multiple-line captions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following steps to create multiple-line captions for your command
buttons:

1. Drop a command button on a form. Do not adjust its size.

2. Set the caption to the following string:

   This is a real long caption to see if this works

3. Set the WordWrap property of the command button to .T.

4. Set the AutoSize property to .T.

Visual FoxPro adjusts the command button's size vertically to accommodate the
caption text. If you adjust the width of the button manually, the vertical size
adjusts. You cannot manually adjust the vertical size of the button. In some
cases it may appear that there is a blank line at the top and bottom of the
button. Set the AutoSize property to false to adjust the size of the button
vertically. Now you can remove the extra line.
