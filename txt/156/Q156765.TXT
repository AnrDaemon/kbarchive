-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, when you choose
SERVERS\<servername>\Private Information Store\Logons, you will see
multiple entries for people connected to the servers.

This is by design. The client logs on once for the private store and once for the
public store; the spooler logs on once for the private store. The client will
also create one additional logon for every mailbox opened as a delegate.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The client version column is controlled by the version of the file
Emsmdb[32].dll that the client computer uses to connect to the Exchange Server
computer.
