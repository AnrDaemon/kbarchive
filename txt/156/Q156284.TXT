TITLE   :ARP -A Causes Access Violation When Pinging Heavily
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.00

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run ARP -A on your computer while running several applications that add
addresses to the ARP cache (such as starting PING from a command script), ARP
experiences an access violation while printing the ARP cache entries.

If you have a Drwatson.log file with symbols installed the stack will look like
the following:

0012fd80 0100142e 00000000 00000000 00000000 77fa4510 arp!PrintArp (FPO:
Non-FPO [3,23,3])
0012ff64 010040dc 00000002 00310800 003101a0 77fa4510 arp!main (FPO: Non-
FPO [2,114,3])

CAUSE
=====

When ARP retrieves the ARP cache entries through SNMP, SNMP does not synchronize
itself with ARP. This lack of synchronization can cause ARP to read the ARP
cache entry as invalid.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
