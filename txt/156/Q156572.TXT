SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install the FTP Server Service for Windows NT
version 4.0. In previous versions of Windows NT, the FTP Server Service is
installed as a component of the TCP/IP protocol. In Windows NT version 4.0, the
FTP Server Service is included as a component of the Peer Web Services in
Windows NT Workstation and a component of Internet Information Server in Windows
NT Server.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the FTP Server Service in Windows NT 4.0, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. Click the Protocols tab, and then click the TCP/IP protocol.

   NOTE: If the TCP/IP protocol is not installed, click Add, click TCP/IP
   Protocol and then click OK.

3. Click Services, click Add, and then click Microsoft Peer Web Services.

   NOTE: For Windows NT Server 4.0, click Microsoft Internet Information Server
   2.0 instead of Microsoft Peer Web Services.

4. Click OK, and then type the path for the Windows NT source files. For
   example, if you are using the Windows NT CD-ROM in drive D, type the
   following line:

      d:\i386

5. Click OK to start the Microsoft Peer Web Services Setup.

6. The FTP Service is selected by default, but you may want to clear the check
   boxes for options you do not want to install.

   NOTE: The FTP Service, along with other Peer Web Service components, can be
   configured by using the Internet Service Manager tool.
