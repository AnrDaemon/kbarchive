TITLE   :Using the IDC "%z" Parameter
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:1.0 2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Internet Database Connector (IDC), and you create links or use
the return value in arguments passed to other documents, you will be unable to
pass arguments that contain spaces.

CAUSE
=====

Spaces are viewed as delimiters and are not passed by default. You can use the
"%z" parameter in your .HTX file to parse and convert these escape characters so
they can be passed as parameters.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following syntax as shown in this HTX sample. The following example will
display a table that builds links dynamically from the queried database. In this
example it returns 3 columns. The first column contains the argument being
passed. The second column contains links that will fail if the value in the
first column contains characters such as spaces. The third column contains links
using the "%z" and will pass the argument properly.

NOTE: This parameter is case sensitive you must use a lower case "z."
