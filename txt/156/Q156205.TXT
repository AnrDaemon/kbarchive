TITLE   :SMS: Windows NT Inventory Agent Detects ATAPI Drives as SCSI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbInventory smsinv kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When a Windows NT system that contains an Enhanced IDE or ATAPI drive is
inventoried, the Systems Management Server (SMS) inventory report shows that it
has a SCSI drive instead.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT uses a SCSI "wrapper" to abstract the IDE interface. This was
designed so large IDE drives that exceed the standard BIOS limitations could be
used with Windows NT. This also allows Windows NT to easily handle other drive
interfaces that may be introduced by the industry.

When SMS hardware inventory is done on a Windows NT system, the registry is read
to determine what hardware is available. Because the internal representation of
the IDE interface in the Windows NT registry shows as a SCSI device for the IDE
hard disk drive, SMS reports this drive as a SCSI drive to the SMS database.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining
the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
