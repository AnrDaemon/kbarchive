SYMPTOMS
========

You have a NEC Versa 4000 computer with the following configuration:

 - IDE controller-1: IDE hard drive (master) and IDE hard drive (slave)

 - IDE controller-2: IDE CD-ROM drive (master/standalone)

When you add the third IDE hard drive as master on the second channel and
reconfigure the CD-ROM drive to be a slave, the following error message will be
displayed:

   STOP 0x0000007B Inaccessible Boot device

The same problem will be noticed with similarly configured systems using
combination IDE disk and IDE CD-ROM drive peripheral devices.


CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the Atapi.sys driver not functioning properly in this
configuration.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, replace the Atapi.sys driver found in the
%SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers directory with the Atapi.sys driver from Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 or later.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3.
