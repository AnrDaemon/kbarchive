KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetupkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Novell NetWare Client Service version 3.5b in Windows NT
4.0, you may receive the following error message:

   STOP: 0x00000093
   INVALID_KERNEL_HANDLE

You may also receive this message after upgrading from Windows NT 3.5x to Windows
NT 4.0 if the NetWare Client Service was not removed before the upgrade.

CAUSE
=====

The Novell NetWare Client Service version 3.5b for Windows NT 3.5x is not
compatible with Windows NT 4.0. The Windows NT 4.0 upgrade process is unable to
upgrade the Novell components.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, rename the Nwfs.sys file using the steps in the
appropriate section below.

Windows NT Installed on a FAT Partition
---------------------------------------

1. Start your computer using the MS-DOS option from the NT OS Loader. (If MS-DOS
   is not an option, boot your computer using an MS-DOS boot disk.)

2. Change directories to the Winnt\System32\Netware folder.

3. Rename the Nwfs.sys file to Nwfs.old.

4. Restart your computer and start Windows NT.

Windows NT Installed on an NTFS Partition
-----------------------------------------

1. You can remove all the network cards from your machine, This will prevent the
   network components from starting and allow you to logon without trapping. If
   this does not work then you must install a parallel copy of Windows NT and
   follow the remaining steps below.

2. Log in to the new installation of Windows NT and run Command Prompt.

3. Change directories to the Winnt\System32\Netware folder on the original
   Windows NT installation.

4. Rename the Nwfs.sys file to Nwfs.old.

5. Restart the original installation of Windows NT.

NOTE: The NetWare Client Service is unable to start without the Nwfs.sys file and
may generate event log errors. After logging into Windows NT, you should
completely remove the Novell NetWare Client Service using the following steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. Click the Services tab, click Novell NetWare Client Services, and then click
   Remove.

3. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

After you have removed the Novell NetWare Client Service, use one of the
following methods to gain access to NetWare resources on the network:

 - Install the Gateway Service for NetWare or the Client Service for NetWare
   that is included with Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation.

 - Contact Novell Technical Support to obtain an updated client for Windows NT
   4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Novell NetWare Client Service is used with Windows NT 3.5x to access NDS
(NetWare Directory Services) objects in a Novell 4.x tree. Windows NT 4.0
includes a client for NetWare that allows access to NDS objects, but does not
allow certain Novell tools to operate in Windows NT.
