SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Internet Database Connector (IDC) with Internet Information
Server (IIS) to populate a HTML Select form control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following HTML sample can be used in an HTX file and will illustrate how to
return database information to dynamically populate a HTML form Select control.

The following form section pasted into a HTX file will dynamically populate the
select control ("JobType") with the return values from the "Title" field.

   <FORM>

   Job Type: <SELECT NAME="JobType">
   <%begindetail%>
      <option><%Title%></option>
   <%enddetail%>
   </select>

   </FORM>

For more information look in Chapter 8 of the Online Documentation for IIS that
details the Internet Database Connector and covers publishing dynamic data on
the Web. Additionally, you can view the JobForum IDC database example
application found on the following Web site:
