OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to start the Information Store service it may fail with an error
-327 recorded in the application log. The entry in the application log may look
similar to the following:


   Event ID: 1005
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Description:
   Unable to start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store. Error -327

This error will be preceded by another application log event by EDB (JET). The
entry in the application log may look similar to the following:

   Event ID: 40
   Source: EDB
   Description:
   MSExchangeIS ((301) ) The database engine found a bad page

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Jet database engine may perform maintenance on pages of the
database without verifying that these page links are indeed valid. This can
cause pages of the database to become corrupt.

WORKAROUND
==========

Repair the corruption and then obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

RESOLUTION
==========

If a current, valid backup of the database is available before the corruption
occurred, use the following steps to repair the corruption:

1. Apply the fix described below. This fix will prevent the corruption from
   happening with the restored good database.

2. Restore the database from backup.

3. Restart the Information Store service.

If a backup is not available, use the following steps (in the order given) to
repair the corruption in the database:

NOTE: This process may result in loss of data.

1. Perform an offline backup of the server making sure to include the Mdbdata
   directory/directories.

2. In the \Mdbdata folder that contains the damaged store, run the following
   utility to remove the damaged page(s) from the database:

   EDBUTIL /d /r <db name>

where <db name> is the database name (for example, priv.edb).

3. Run the following utility to repair any Information Store or database
   inconsistencies that may have occurred from removing the bad page:

   ISINTEG -fix -dbname

Where -dbname is the database name (for example, -priv).

4. Restart the Information Store service.

After repairing the database corruption, apply the fix described below to prevent
this type of corruption from occurring again. The fix allows the Microsoft Jet
database engine to test the validity of the page links before performing
maintenance on them.
