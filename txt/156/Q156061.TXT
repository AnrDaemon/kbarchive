SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses what is required in order to use the FoxPro SQLPrepare()
function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to use the FoxPro SQLPrepare() function, the ODBC driver must support
the ODBC API SQLPrepare() function. In theory, this should include all ODBC
drivers because SQLPrepare() is a requirement for ODBC API Core conformance.
However, depending on the ODBC driver and the capabilities of the server,
SQLPrepare() may not do anything. For example, no preparation of the statement
takes place, but it is saved to be executed on SQLExecute().
