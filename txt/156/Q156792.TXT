PAGE      STEP      SEVERITY
-----     ----      --------  -----------------------------------------
160       3         Minor     Problem: BufferMode property is already
                              set to pessimistic (though pessimistic is
                              NOT VFP default).
                              Fix: None necessary; but step 3 is
                              redundant. In future releases/patches,
                              BufferMode should be 0 (None) at the start
                              of Lesson 9.

162       2         Minor     Problem: Putting the Delete & Save buttons
                              on the screen covers up the "Total Cost"
                              label.
                              Fix: All command buttons (including Add,
                              on page 161) should be placed so that top
                              of button is one-and-a-half grid boxes
                              below the grid (or half a grid box below
                              the bottom of "Total Cost").

163       6         Medium    Problem: Step 6 says to close the custordr
                              form, but next set of steps requires the
                              form open and does not say to reopen it.
                              Fix: Step 6 should say, "Close the
                              custordr form and save changes."
                              Increase the number of the second set of
                              steps by 1, then add the following steps:
                              1  Open the custordr form.
                              7  Close the custordr form and save
                              changes.

164       2/Scrn    Minor     Problem: The word "Sorry" is misspelled
                              - missing an "r".
                              This is true in code & in screen shot.
                              Fix: Change the spelling in code and book.

165       3/Scrn    Serious   Problem: Misspelled variable: "lgOldTalk"
                              should be "glOldTalk."

166       Para 2    Minor     Missing hyphen at end of first line
                              between "in" and "definitely".

166       3         Medium    Problem: Screen shot is wrong. It shows
                              only one line of code (which was just
                              added in step 3), but code already should
                              be there from earlier steps in this
                              lesson.
                              Fix: remove screen shot on page 166.

167       2         Medium    Problem: Lines 2, 4, and 25 are
                              continuations of previous comment lines
                              but look like new lines. If typed in as
                              is, the code will cause an error when the
                              program is run.
                              Fix: Precede lines with comment character
                              "*" (as other commented lines).

167       2         Severe    Problem: Missing the code line ENDIF. This
                              will cause runtime errors.
                              Fix: After the following lines:
                                   STORE .f. TO llAllOk
                                   EXIT
                              Add line:
                                   ENDIF

168       2         Severe    Problem: Missing parentheses.
                              Fix: Fourth line of code should read:
                                   =MESSAGEBOX("Order Could Not Be
                              Saved")

168       2         Severe    Problem: Extra space.
                              Fix: Last line of code should read:
                                   THISFORM.Release()

168       6         ?         After step 6, add the following step:
                              7.  Set the Data Sessions to Private
                              This prevents the error "Alias CUSTOMER not
                              found" from occurring after closing the first
                              copy of the form in step 6 on page 169.

                              This error would be caused by the
                              customer table being closed when the first
                              form is closed and the open form attempting
                              to access it.


OTHER: Running form CUSTORDR from CUSTDATA and then clicking the Save button
might produce an error on the "RLOCK(0)" line. This is a legal operation
(attempt to lock a table header) and should not cause an error. There might be
other circumstances causing this, and this error does not occur in the revised
code from patch #1.

NOTE THAT A PATCH HAS BEEN CREATED AND RELEASED FOR LESSON 9. NO CHANGES WERE
MADE TO USER-ENTERED CODE. For more information regarding this patch, including
download instructions, please see the following Knowledge Base article:
