The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While using Creative Writer 2 to save a web page, you may encounter the
following error messages:

   CWWEB.DLL Not Found.

   -or-

   A required Creative Writer file, CWWEB.DLL, is missing. Please re-install
   Creative Writer by running Setup on the Creative Writer CD.

CAUSE
=====

If you run Creative Writer 2 using Autoplay, the Apps Path entry in the registry
is apparently being ignored. This problem has been reported on systems running
Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, copy the Cwweb.dll file from the Creative Writer
compact disc to the same directory as Writer.exe. Microsoft has created a file
called Dllmove.exe that will move Cwweb.dll to the correct directory to avoid
this problem in the future. Double-click Dllmove.exe to run it.

How to Obtain Dllmove.exe
-------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

   Dllmove.exe
   (http://download.microsoft.com/download/cwriter20win95/Update/1/WIN98/EN-US/Dllmove.exe)

MORE INFORMATION

by running Creative Writer 2 directly from the hard disk. Hold down the SHIFT
key while inserting the Creative Writer 2 compact disc to disable Autoplay.
