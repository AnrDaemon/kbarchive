   1. Open the template that is experiencing the problem.

   2. Press ALT+F11 to start the Visual Basic Editor.

   3. Expand the TemplateProject for the template you have opened by clicking on
      the plus sign next to TemplateProject(templatename).

   4. Expand Microsoft Word Objects by clicking on the plus sign next to
      Microsoft Word Objects.

   5. Double-click ThisDocument to open the code window.

   6. Type an apostrophe in front of the line of code that reads as follows:

   ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.Caption = ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.Caption &" - Report"

      The apostrophe comments out the line so that it is not read in the code.

   7. Quit the Visual Basic Editor.

   8. Save the template you have opened.

   The file name should now appear on the document title bar when you save a
   document that has been opened based on one of these templates.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word uses a new feature that inserts a caption on the Word document
title bar. The caption feature helps you remember what type of template the
document is based on. This caption appears whenever a document is created using
any of the Word shipped templates.

The file name is not updated on the title bar of the document window when the
file is saved. Word saves the document correctly; the title bar is not updated
with the correct file name.

The following templates exhibit this problem:

 - Contemporary Fax.dot

 - Contemporary Memo.dot

 - Contemporary Report.dot

 - Elegant Fax.dot

 - Elegant Memo.dot

 - Elegant Report.dot

 - Fax Wizard.wiz

 - Memo Wizard.wiz

 - Newsletter Wizard.wiz

 - Pleading Wizard.wiz

 - Professional Fax.dot

 - Professional Memo.dot

 - Professional Report.dot

 - Resume Wizard.wiz
