TITLE   :Unusual Addresses Like 1.10.0.184 Showing in WINS Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use WINS Manager, you notice a WINS server with an address of
1.10.0.184, 1.35.0.184, 0.62.0.184, or 0.227.0.184, or you notice an owner with
these addresses when you click Show Database on the Mappings menu.

You will also notice when you view the mappings for the selected owner (real IP
address of the WINS server itself), that you do not see any name registrations
for that server. An NBTSTAT -N command will show the correct WINS server
registrations.


CAUSE
=====

The Remote Access Service (RAS) WAN Wrapper is bound before the network
interface card (NIC).


RESOLUTION
==========

1. Go to the Main group, double-click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Network.

2. Click Bindings.

3. In the Show Bindings For list, click All Protocols, and then double-click
   WINS Client (TCP/IP).

   move it below your network adapter driver.

   NOTE: There may be multiple RAS WAN Wrapper entries.

Perform the following steps to work around this problem:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and
   double-click Network.

2. Click the Bindings tab.

3. In the Show Bindings For list, click All Protocols, then double-click WINS
   Client (TCP/IP).

4. Click Remote Access Service WAN Wrapper, and then click Move Down to move it
   below your network adapter driver.

   NOTE: There may be multiple RAS WAN Wrapper entries.

5. In the Show Bindings For list, click All services.

6. For each service, select the WINS Client (TCP/IP) and verify that the network
   adapter is now listed first. Move the Remote Access Service WAN Wrappers down
   if needed.

   NOTE: There may be multiple RAS WAN Wrapper entries.
