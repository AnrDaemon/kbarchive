TITLE   :SMS: Collected Files Do Not Show as a UNC in Administrator
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbsmsAdmin smsadminkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you view collected files for a client from a remote Systems Management
Server Administrator user interface (UI) console, LocalFileName shows the local
path location for the file, instead of showing the UNC path (the UNC path was
displayed in Systems Management Server 1.1). As a result, if Systems Management
Server Administrator is run on a computer other than the site server, you will
be unable to use the Administrator UI to open any collected files located on the
site server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
