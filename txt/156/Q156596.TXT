SUMMARY
=======

When you create a mailbox in Microsoft Phone version 1.0, you cannot specify the
number that callers must press to access the mailbox. If you create multiple
mailboxes, you may be able to change the numbers that callers must press to
access the mailboxes after they are created, but only by deleting and recreating
one or more mailboxes. If you create only one mailbox, you cannot change the
number that callers must press to access the mailbox after it is created.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create a mailbox in Microsoft Phone, the mailbox is assigned a number
that callers must press to access it. Microsoft Phone does not allow you to
specify the number assigned to a particular mailbox while you are creating it,
change the number assigned to a particular mailbox after it is created, or
change the order of multiple mailboxes after they are created.

However, you may be able to change the order of multiple mailboxes after they are
created by deleting and recreating one or more mailboxes. For example, if you
create three mailboxes, you can switch the order of the second and third
mailboxes by following these steps:

1. Delete the second and third mailboxes.

2. Recreate the third mailbox.

3. Recreate the second mailbox.

Note that Microsoft Phone does not automatically change the number assigned to
the remaining mailboxes when you delete a mailbox. If you only delete the second
mailbox in the above example, callers must still press "3" to access the third
mailbox. In addition, if you create another mailbox, the new mailbox becomes the
second mailbox, not the third. Therefore, you cannot switch the order of the
second and third mailboxes by deleting and recreating only the second mailbox.
