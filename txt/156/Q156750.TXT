TITLE   :AddGroupNameResponse Frame from WinNT May Cause WFWG to Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0; :
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 computers running the NetBEUI protocol may stop
responding during initialization. NetBIOS applications using AddGroupName may
also fail.

CAUSE
=====

This may be caused if the workgroup name for the Windows for Workgroups system
is used as the computer name by another Windows NT 3.51 or Windows NT 4.0
computer also running the NetBEUI protocol. If the name is in use, the computer
running Windows for Workgroups should produce an error message (error 6117).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

A NetBIOS application may register a group name using the AddGroupName command.
NetBEUI then sends an AddGroupName Multicast frame on the network. If the name
is already registered as a unique name by Windows NT 3.51 (or 4.0), the Windows
NT computer sends an AddNameResponse frame. The Data2 field of the
AddNameResponse frame indicates whether the name is registered by the Windows NT
computer as a GroupName or UniqueName. The Windows NT computer was incorrectly
setting this field to indicate that it had registered the name as a GroupName.
More than one computer can register a NetBIOS name as a group name. However, a
NetBIOS name cannot be registered as both a group name and a unique name. If the
Data2 of the AddNameResponse frame from Windows NT was set correctly to
UniqueName, then Windows for Workgroups would have presented the error to the
user because the name was already in use.
