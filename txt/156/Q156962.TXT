The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Exchange Server, mail sent from AppleTalk mail to Microsoft
Exchange with recipients on the BCC line will display the blind copied
recipients on the TO line in the Microsoft Exchange client.

This problem occurs when using either the Microsoft Exchange Connection or
Microsoft Mail Connection 3.2 software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Mail does not support BCC, so both the Microsoft Mail Connection
version 3.2 and Exchange Connection get around this limitation by using a
Microsoft Mail feature called "hidden recipient." Basically the Microsoft Mail
client knows not to display blind copied recipients.

Because this is a Microsoft Mail feature that Microsoft Exchange does not
support, the Microsoft Exchange client will display the blind copied recipients
on the TO line.

The following note can be found in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator's Guide:

   Note: If you send messages using the BCC feature in MS Mail (AppleTalk) to
   Microsoft Exchange or MS Mail (PC) users, the information in the BCC line
   appears in the TO box

Microsoft Exchange Administrator's Guide, Chapter 10, p. 315.
