TITLE   :How to Make Program Manager the Shell in Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 ships with a new shell, Explorer.exe. This can be changed to
Program Manager by modifying a registry setting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the shell from Explorer to Program Manager, modify the following
registry key:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor can cause serious, system-wide errors that may
require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

   \Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell
   (currently Explorer.exe).

3. Change Explorer.exe to Progman.exe.

4. Quit Registry Editor; shut down and restart the system.

If this is a new setup of Windows NT 4.0 you will have to create all Program
Manager groups because Windows NT 4.0 setup does not create any Program Manager
groups. If this is an upgrade from a previous version of Windows NT, you will
have to create program groups for any applications you installed after
installing Windows NT 4.0, because Explorer does not use program group files.
Program groups will be created for any applications you install after changing
your shell to Program Manager.
