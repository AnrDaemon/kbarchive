The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Using the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, you can specify the
recipients container in which you want to store new public folders on a
Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Public Folder Container option is available on the General page of the
Information Store Site Configuration object's Properties dialog box. This option
lets you choose the recipients container where all new public folders created in
this site appear. For example, you may want to group all public folders in a
recipients container called Public Folders. Grouping public folders in this
manner makes it easier to locate a specific public folder from the address book
and from the Administrator window.

Changing the public folder container changes the location where all new public
folders are stored. This does not affect the public folders that have already
been created. If no container is specified, the default is the recipients
container for the site.

To specify the location on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer to store new
public folders, follow these steps:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.

2. Select the Information Store Site Configuration object located in the
   Configuration container.

3. On the File Menu, click Properties.

4. In the Properties dialog box, select General, then select Modify.

5. In the Public Folder Container dialog box, select a recipients container
   where all new public folders are stored.
