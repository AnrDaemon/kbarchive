TITLE   :XCLN: Contributor Unable to Submit Form to Public Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open a form installed in a Public Folder for which you have
contributor privileges, the following error message may appear:

   The folder could not be opened. You need additional permission to perform
   this operation. See your administrator.

CAUSE
=====

The behavior is due to the design of the Public Folder permission hierarchy and
how forms are composed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, try one of the following.

1. Add the Public Folder to the Global Address List (GAL).

   a. In the Admin.exe program, select the properties for the Public Folder.

   b. On the Advanced tab, clear the "Hide from Address Book" check box.

2. Create the form as a send form instead of a post form and mail it to the
   Public Folder.

-or-

If the form has already been designed as a post form (and has not been
extended):

1. Create a new send form.

2. Copy and paste the controls from the old form to the new form.

-or-

If the form must be a post form, try one of the following two workarounds:

1. Configure, at minimum, Reviewer privileges for all accounts that will
   contribute.

2. Create a rule in the public folder that contains the folder application, to
   auto forward all items to another Public Folder that only a selected few have
   privileges to.

-or-

1. Install the folder application to an accessible folder (like a personal
   folder).

2. After starting the form from the personal folder, submit the item and drag it
   from the accessible folder to the destination Public Folder, which also
   contains the same folder application.
