TITLE   :XCON: MTA Doesn't Accept IA5 in General Text Body Part
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It is impossible to send a message from a remote message transfer agent (MTA) to
Microsoft Exchange Server over a 1988 X.400 connector. The message is rejected
with a non-delivery report (NDR). In the Microsoft Exchange Server Application
Event log you will see the following error message:

   Event ID: 210
   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Type: Error
   Description:
   An internal MTA error occurred. Content conversion for message
   C=FR;A=ATLAS;P=RPEXC;L=7705001613031996/A07679/LSPT failed.
   Conversion error: 4096, Object at fault: 06000057,
   Original content type: 56010A01,
   New content type: 2A864886F7140501.[MTA DISP:FANOUT 26 9] (14)

CAUSE
=====

This error will occur when the remote MTA is configured to send all message
content as a General Text Body Part and sends a message containing only IA5
characters. This configuration is possible with the DEC MRX product.

General Text Body Part has a parameter for designating character set
registrations. Currently the Microsoft Exchange Server system sends out
{C0,G0,G1} == {1,6,100} for character set ISO8859-1.

   1   == C0 control characters like LF, CR and so forth
   6   == ISO646 basic 7 bit characters for ASCII in G0
   100 == ISO8859-1 G1 extended Latin 1 chars

Inbound, the MTA checks for the presence of 6 and 100, and if it has both, it
then uses the ISO8859-1 tables to do the conversion, otherwise an NDR message is
sent with invalid content type because no support for other character sets
exists.


RESOLUTION
==========

A possible workaround is to configure the remote MTA so that it does not send
all messages as General Text Body Part.

This fix allows Microsoft Exchange to accept General Text Body Part with the
following registered character sets {C0,G0} == {1,6}.

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

STATUS
======
