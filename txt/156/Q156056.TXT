TITLE   :Unable to Start the Monitor Service - Error 2002
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start the Monitor service from the Command Prompt or from the
Control Panel Services tool, you receive the following error:

   Could not start the monitor service on SERVERNAME. Error 2002 - the window
   style or class attribute is invalid for this operation.

Monitor.exe is a command-line utility that ships with the Microsoft Windows NT
version 3.51 Resource Kit. Monitor.exe controls the Data Logging Service that
performs the same function as the Alert and Logging facility in Performance
Monitor. You can schedule the Datalog.exe file to start automatically using
Monitor.exe and the At.exe commands, but you must start the Performance Monitor
manually.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if one or more of the following is true:

 - The Monitor service cannot locate the workspace settings (.pmw) file that it
   was configured to use.

 - The workspace settings file (.pmw) was saved in Chart view or no objects were
   added to monitor.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workspace settings file (.pmw) must reside in the %Systemroot%\System32
directory. It also must be saved in Log view, not in Chart view.

The .pmw file is a Performance Monitor workspace file that saves current
Performance Monitor objects and counters to be used with the Monitor and Datalog
utilities. For more information on these utilities, see the Microsoft Windows NT
Resource Kit documentation.
