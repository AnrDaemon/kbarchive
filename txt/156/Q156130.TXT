-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

OLE DB applications, providers, and consumers can use redistributable components
from the OLE DB SDK to enhance their products. This article provides some
guidelines for redistributing these SDK components, and describes specific
scenarios and the components required to support each scenario.

MORE INFORMATION
================

OLE DB applications, providers, and consumers should install all OLE DB SDK
redistributable files to the directory specified by the registry subkey
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\MSSetup. The system library
Msvcrt40.dll, which is required by all OLE DB implementations, should be
installed in the user's system directory.

All Providers Should Install the Root Enumerator Object
-------------------------------------------------------

All OLE DB providers should install the OLE DB root enumerator object, to ensure
that applications and consumers can find the provider on the user's computer.
The provider's installation should install the following files:

   Msdaenum.dll
   Msdatt.dll
   Msdatl.dll

Providers Requiring Error Services
----------------------------------

OLE DB providers that require the services of the Error object must compile with
the Msdaguid.h header file. The provider's installation should install the
following files on the user's computer:

   Msdaer.dll
   Msdaerr.dll
   Msdatl.dll

Providers Requiring Data Conversion Services
--------------------------------------------

OLE DB providers that require the services of the Data Conversion object must
compile with the Msdaguid.h header file. The provider's installation should
install the following file on the user's computer:

   Msdadc.dll

Implementations Requiring Access to SQL Data
--------------------------------------------

OLE DB applications and consumers that require access to SQL data can use the
ODBC provider. These implementations must compile with the Msdasql.h header
file. The implementation's installation should install the following files:

   Msdasql.dll
   Msdasqlr.dll
   Msdaer.dll
   Msdaerr.dll
   Msdadc.dll
   Msdatt.dll
   Msdatl.dll
   Msdaenum.dll
