TITLE   :XADM: To: Recipients Shown Half-size if Client is on Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your computer is running Windows NT Server version 4.0 and you install a
Microsoft Exchange Service Pack 2 Server before the Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack 2 client, you will see that the scroll control for the To, From, Cc, and
Bcc boxes is not the full up or down arrow, but smaller and squished. Clicking
the buttons will scroll the view of the name, cut it in half, and never go to a
new line. In addition, if you perform a Check Name, the name will be shifted
down, cut in half, and no scroll option will be provided.


CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange client and Administrator programs use different character
sets. One is using a single byte character set (SBCS) and the other is using a
double byte character set (DBCS). Both need to use the same character set.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
