KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbSSafe400bug kbSSafe500bug kbSSafe600fix kbVBp400

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have checked out and modified files from a project that is under
SourceSafe control without checking out the .vbp file, unsaved changes to those
files will be erased without warning if you then check out the .VBP.

WORKAROUND
==========

Either checkout the VBP file before modifying any file in the project or save
all modified files in the project before checking out the VBP file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual SourceSafe
version 6.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Steps one through five can be omitted if you already have a Visual Basic project
under SourceSafe control with all files checked in.

1. Start Visual Basic 4.0. A default project is created.

2. Save the project, form1.frm & project1.vbp, in a new directory such as
   C:\temp\testme.

3. Click Yes in the messagebox asking you if the project should be added to
   SourceCode control.

4. Click Create in the Add SourceSafe Project dialog, then click Yes when
   prompted to create the project. The default name is Project1.

5. Add both files to the SourceSafe project in the Add to SourceSafe dialog. By
   default, both files are now checked in. In the Visual Basic 4.0 project
   window, form1.frm is now correctly marked as read-only.

6. In the Visual Basic 4.0 project window, right-click the line containing
   form1.frm, and invoke the Check Out command.

7. In the Check Out File(s) from SourceSafe dialog, only form1.frm is selected.
   Click OK to check out only form1.frm. Do not check out project1.vbp. The
   bitmap in the Visual Basic 4.0 project window now shows that form1.frm is
   checked out.

8. Click View Form in the Visual Basic project window and make some changes to
   the form, such as placing a Command button on the form.

9. Right-click again on form1.frm in the Visual Basic 4.0 project window, and
   choose the Check Out command. You will find only project1.vbp in the list of
   Files to be checked out. Select the file and check it out. Note that
   Form1.frm is replaced by its previous version without any warning.

The same behavior, such as unsaved changes being overwritten, will happen to any
component in the project when the VBP file is checked out.
