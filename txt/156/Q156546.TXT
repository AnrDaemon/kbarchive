SYMPTOMS
========

When you have the service type for MSN, The Microsoft Network, set to MSN only,
you may receive the following message when you start Microsoft Exchange:

   Cannot connect to the Internet.

   To get Internet Access with MSN, you need to change your service type
   to 'Internet and The Microsoft Network' and choose new phone numbers.
   Would you like to do this now?

CAUSE
=====

This symptom occurs with some retail versions of Microsoft Exchange when the
"Connect to the Internet as needed" option is enabled.


RESOLUTION
==========

Click No to acknowledge the message. Microsoft Exchange continues to open. When
you receive the message a second time, click No again. Note that the second
message may be hidden behind the Microsoft Exchange window.

To prevent the message from occurring, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Internet.

2. Click the Connection tab.

3. Click the "Connect to the Internet as needed" check box to clear it.

4. Click OK.
