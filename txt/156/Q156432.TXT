TITLE   :Windows NT 4.0 Policy Restriction Error at Logon
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 allows administrators to create system policies
that determine what programs users can run. In System Policy editor, an
administrator can create a user policy, then create a list of allowable
executables under User\System\Restrictions\Run only allowed Windows applications
on the Properties screen. After creating this user policy, however, the affected
user may receive the following error immediately after logging on:

   This operation has been canceled due to restrictions in effect on this
   computer.

If the user continues past this error message, the Desktop will appear, but the
arrow that normally appears, pointing to the Start button with the message
"Click here to start," will not appear. Otherwise, the executables allowed in
the system policy will run without error.

CAUSE
=====

After you log on, a program called Systray.exe is run. This program creates the
startup arrow and controls the message icons on the taskbar.

If Internet Explorer 4.0 is installed, the computer runs another program called
Loadwc.exe. For a description of Loadwc.exe, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q176960
   TITLE : Description of the Loadwc.exe File in Internet Explorer

RESOLUTION
==========

Add Systray.exe to the list of allowable executables in the System Policy.

If Internet Explorer 4.0 is been installed, Loadwc.exe also needs to be added to
the list of allowable executables in the System Policy.


NOTE:You may also need to add mstinit.exe to the list of allowable executables in
the System Policy. Mstinit.exe is part of Internet Explorer 5.5.

You may also want to use Regedit.exe or regedt32.exe and look at the following
registry key for other applicaions that load during startup:
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
