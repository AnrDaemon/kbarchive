TITLE   :XFOR: SMTP Headers Lost for DOS MS Mail Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an MS-DOS Microsoft Mail client receives SMTP mail through the Microsoft
Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) to a Microsoft Mail Postoffice, the
recipient will not see the SMTP headers.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Microsoft Mail Interchange (MSMI) stores the SMTP headers
in the Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) part of the message when it
pulls the message from Microsoft Exchange Server and creates a Microsoft Mail
file for it. The MS-DOS Microsoft Mail client will not interpret any of the TNEF
data, unlike the Window 16 and Windows 32 clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
