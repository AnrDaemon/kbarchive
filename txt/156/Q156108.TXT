PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER::1997 edition; WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Windows 
 - Microsoft Office for Windows 95 Professional edition 
 - Microsoft Office for Windows 95, Standard edition 
 - Microsoft Works for Windows 95, version 4.0, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Lookup Reference tool in Microsoft Office or Microsoft Works to
open Encarta, the feature does not work. In Works, you may hear a system error
"ding" sound.

In Word, the following error message appears:

   Encarta Encyclopedia cannot start
   Unable to complete this action while Encarta Encyclopedia windows are open.
   Close any open dialog boxes or screens in Encarta Encyclopedia, then try
   again.

CAUSE
=====

Encarta is displaying a modal (active) dialog box. You need to close Modal
dialog boxes before you open other dialog boxes, such as the Encyclopedia
screen. An example of a modal dialog is the Encarta Media Gallery. You must
close this box before Lookup Reference works.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do the following:

1. Click OK to clear the error message. If you do not see the error message,
   press and hold down the ALT keyboard key then press the TAB key (ALT+TAB)
   repeatedly until you see the error message. Click OK.

2. Close the open dialog box or Encarta screen, for example, the Media Gallery.

3. Use the ALT+TAB key combination to return to the referring program. Try the
   Lookup Reference feature again.
