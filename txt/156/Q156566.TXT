SUMMARY
=======

If you used Microsoft Mail before migrating to Microsoft Exchange, you might
have message files (MMF files) that you want to move to Microsoft Exchange. To
do so, you must convert the information from its original format to a PST file.
You can then add this file to your active profile. To see the steps to import an
MMF file, please see the Microsoft Exchange Client Help topic on Importing MMF
files. This article discusses the file size differences between MMF and PST
files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MMF Smaller than PST:

When an MMF file is converted to a PST file, the size difference will be
noticeable. The PST file will usually be larger than the original MMF file. This
is due to the way that PST files store Compressed RTF and Message Body for each
message. MMF files only store Message Body format and not the Compressed RTF
format.

MMF imported into Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Folder:

Migrating the same MMF file to a Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox folder will
cause less data to be stored on the Microsoft Exchange Server. This is because
it only stores the RTF part of the message and it is compressed. Compressed RTF
is usually smaller than the original plain-text body.

PST Smaller than MMF:

A non-compacted MMF file that is converted to a PST file can actually yield a PST
file that is smaller than the source MMF file. In addition, if the source MMF
file has corrupt messages in it, those messages will be deleted by the migration
utility, resulting in a smaller PST file.

TIP: To reduce the size of your MMF file, discard messages that you no longer
need and compact the file before importing it.

PST encryption is a direct byte substitution for the original data, so a PST file
with encryption will be the same size as an otherwise identical PST file without
encryption.
