TITLE   :SMS: SNMP Site Property Changes Are Not Saved
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbSCMan kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smssiteconfigman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the Enterprise section of the SNMP Trap Filter Properties from
"NT Event Source" to "OID", changes made to the SNMP Site Properties are
discarded. However, making the opposite change (changing the Enterprise section
from "OID" to "NT Event Source") works fine; the changes are saved in this case.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Click Site Properties, then SNMP Traps, and then click Proposed Properties.

2. Select the entry you want to change from "NT Event Source" to "OID."

3. Click Delete.

4. Re-create the entry, using the "OID" option instead of "NT Event Source."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
