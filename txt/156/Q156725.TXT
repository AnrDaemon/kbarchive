TITLE   :XFOR: MS Mail X.400 Gateways and Exchange X.121 Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your Microsoft Exchange Server sends a message indirectly via a Shared File
System (SFS) X.400 gateway, and part of the X.400 O/R address contains:

   X.121=

and there is a period between the X and the 1, the X.400 gateway will fail to
process the message. The following error will appear on the X.400 gateway if it
is running with the -lvd command line option:

   15:46:15 Extracting message from local message store: 00000020
   15:46:15 DEBUG (Converting PC Mail message to X400): Translating to X400
   15:46:15 ERROR 3 (Creating P1 Recipient address): Malformed address: type
   <16>

CAUSE
=====

The SFS X.400 gateway will only process X.121 addresses when there is no period
between the X and the 1. The period will be present when an X.400 address is
imported from Microsoft Mail to Microsoft Exchange Server using Directory
Synchronization (DirSync) and the address is of the format
c=gb;a=admd;p=prmd;x.121=1234567890. This is a valid address, but not an address
that the SFS X.400 gateway will be able to process.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
