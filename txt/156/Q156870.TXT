KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Mouse and Click events do not fire on same areas of the object. The Click
event ignores clicks to the scroll bar.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The behavior of the Mouse and Click events differ. The Click event executes
after clicking on the item itself; however, the Click event ignores clicks to
the object's scroll bars. For example, clicking on an item listed in a list box
triggers the Click event.

Conversely, Mouse events react to both clicks on the object and the scroll bars
of the object. For example, consider a list box and its scroll bars. A MouseUp
or MouseDown event fires after clicking the contents of the list box or the
scroll bars of the object.

This behavior occurs with grid and list box objects.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form called Test.

2. Place a list box object on the form.

3. Right-click the list box and start the Builder.

4. Under the List Items tab, change the "Fill List with" box to "Data entered by
   hand." Enter in three values for three rows. Choose the OK button.

5. In the MouseUp, MouseDown, and Click events of the list box enter the
   following command:

      WAIT WINDOW PROGRAM()

6. Run the form and click on the scroll bars. Only the MouseUp and MouseDown
   events fire. Now click on a row of the list box. The Click, MouseUp, and
   MouseDown events all respond.
