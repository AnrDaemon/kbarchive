presentation in the PowerPoint Viewer:

   Sorry, this is not a PowerPoint presentation.

   Knowledge Base:

   size, date, or version:

   Ole2.dll
   Ole2prox.dll
   Ole2disp.dll
   Ole2conv.dll
   Storage.dll
   Compobj.dll

3. The filename listed in the PowerPoint Presentation Playlist (*.lst) contains
   a long filename.

RESOLUTION
==========

How to Install Correct Versions of OLE Files
--------------------------------------------

NOTE: These steps assume that Windows is installed in the folder C:\Windows.

1. Exit Windows.

2. At the command prompt, type:

   cd \windows\system and then press ENTER

   ren ole2*.* ole2*.old and then press ENTER

   ren storage.dll storage.old and then press ENTER

   ren compobj.dll compobj.old and then press ENTER

3. Start Windows.

4. Insert the PowerPoint Viewer disk that ships with Office 95 into your disk
   drive.

5. Run the program called Vsetup.exe on this disk.

This procedure installs all of the PowerPoint viewer files and replaces the OLE
files in Windows 3.1x.
