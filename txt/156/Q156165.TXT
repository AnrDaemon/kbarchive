SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows NT does not support the Internet Control Message Protocol
(ICMP) time stamps fields as described in RFC 792.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although Packet Internet Groper (PING) supports time stamping (ping -s) with
ICMP Type 13 for the time stamp message, and ICMP Type 14 for the time stamp
reply message, it does not use the ICMP time stamp field format. This is
described in RFC 792:

   The Originate Timestamp is the time the sender last touched the message
   before sending it, the Receive Timestamp is the time the echoer first touched
   it on receipt, and the Transmit Timestamp is the time the echoer last touched
   the message on sending it.

These time stamps can be used to estimate the delay between hosts and they can be
used to synchronize the clocks on the hosts. According to RFC 1122, ICMP time
stamps are optional.
