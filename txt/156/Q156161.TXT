TITLE   :PPT7: How To Print Shadowed Text to PCL Printers
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbprint kbdta kbPrinting

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to print shadowed text to any of the following Windows 95 PCL
printer drivers, you do not get the desired results:

   Hewlett-Packard LaserJet Series II and compatible printers
   Hewlett-Packard LaserJet Series III and compatible printers
   Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4 and compatible printers
   Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5 and compatible printers
   Okidata OL Laserjet Printers


CAUSE
=====

In order to print shadowed text correctly, a printer driver must support
printing text in shades of gray. The Windows 95 drivers for these printers do
not support printing gray text. Earlier Windows 3.x versions of the LaserJet 4
printer drivers do print shadowed text properly. Although you can use these
drivers to print in Windows 95, you may encounter other printing problems.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use one of the following methods to print the effect of shadowed text to
LaserJet-type printers:

Method 1: Create the shadowed text using Microsoft WordArt
----------------------------------------------------------

Method 2: Convert the shadowed text to a bitmap
-----------------------------------------------

1. Select the text box that contains the shadowed text.

2. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

3. Start Windows Paint.

4. In Paint, click Attributes on the Image menu. Change the Width and Height to
   1. Click OK.

5. On the Edit menu, click Paste. Paint asks if you want to resize the image.
   Click Yes.

6. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

7. Switch back to PowerPoint.

8. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

This procedure pastes a bitmap picture of the shadowed text into your PowerPoint
presentation. When you print the picture, it prints shadowed text as it appears
on the screen.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Microsoft PCL Printer drivers
for Windows 95.
