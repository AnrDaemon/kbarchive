TITLE   :PRB: INSERT Can Freeze VFP if Table's Index File Corrupted
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:5.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the INSERT command is executed on a Table that has a corrupted Index file,
Visual FoxPro can freeze with the following error:

   "This program has caused an illegal operation and will be shutdown"

RESOLUTION
==========

To fix this problem, do one of the following:

 - Issue the REINDEX command to attempt to repair the index file.

 - Copy the structure and contents of the table in question to another table as
   follows:

      USE TstTable
      COPY STRUCTURE TO mytst WITH PRODUCTION
      USE mytst IN 0
      SELECT mytst
      APPEND FROM TstTable

You should now be able to use the INSERT command with the new table.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. There is no way to predict product behavior when
data or index corruption has occurred.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you issue an INSERT command similar to the following:

      INSERT INTO TstTable (TstField) VALUES ("aaaaa")

and the index file of TstTable is somehow corrupted, Visual FoxPro will produce
the following error and will freeze:

   "This program has caused an illegal operation and will be shutdown"

You will be able to exit Visual FoxPro by clicking Close in the error dialog.
