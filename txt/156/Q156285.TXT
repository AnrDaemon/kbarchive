The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 4.0, you may notice that your sound card was not
detected or installed.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 4.0 Setup does not automatically detect or install sound cards. This
behavior is consistent with previous versions of Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

To install your sound card, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Multimedia.

2. On the Devices tab, click Add.

3. Click the appropriate driver for your sound card, and then click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The behavior described in this article should occur only when you perform a new
installation of Windows NT. If you are upgrading a previous version of Windows
NT in which a sound card was properly installed, Windows NT 4.0 uses the
existing settings.
