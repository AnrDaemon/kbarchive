SYMPTOMS
========

After you open the Htmlview.dot file, you may be unable to close the document or
save your changes. When you click Close, Save, or Save As on the File menu, the
following error message is displayed:

   Run-time error '4633': Unable to run the specified macro.

CAUSE
=====

The Close, Save, and Save As commands are mapped to macros that call HTML code
functions; therefore, you cannot perform these actions with the Htmlview.dot
template.

WORKAROUND
==========

To close the template, use the following steps to quit Word:

1. Save and close any currently open files except the Htmlview.dot template.

2. On the File menu, click Exit.

3. When prompted to save changes to the Htmlview.dot template, click No.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Htmlview.dot file is designed to be used for viewing Web page source HTML
code and should not be modified. Any unsupported modifications to the
Htmlview.dot may result in unexpected behavior.
