KEYWORDS:kbusage kbproof

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you check spelling and grammar in a Word 97 document, the following message
may appear, although there are obvious spelling and grammatical errors in your
document:

   The spelling and grammar check is complete.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

 - The text that contains the errors is formatted as hidden text.

   -and-

 - The Show/Hide button on the Standard toolbar is not pressed. In other words,
   you cannot see the hidden text.

   -or-

   The All check box on the View tab (click Options on the Tools menu) is not
   selected.

After you check the document for spelling and grammatical errors one time, Word
"marks" the text, including the hidden text, so that it is not rechecked.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and check all of the text, including the hidden
text, use the following steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the View tab.

2. On the View tab, click the Show All check box to select it.

If you already checked the spelling and grammar while the hidden text was not
visible, use one of the following methods to recheck the document:

Method 1: Toggle the Hidden Text
--------------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the View tab.

2. On the View tab, under Nonprinting Characters, click to select the All check
   box.

3. Click OK.

4. Select the hidden text.

   Word displays hidden text on the screen with a dotted underline.

5. On the Format menu, click Font, and click the Font tab.

6. Under Effects, click to clear the Hidden check box, and then click OK.

   The hidden text should still be selected.

7. On the Format menu, click Font, and click the Font tab.

8. Under Effects, click to select the Hidden check box, and then click OK.

9. On the Tools menu, click Spelling And Grammar.

Method 2: Modify the Hidden Text
--------------------------------

1. Type a character at the start of the hidden text that contains the spelling
   or grammatical error, and then delete that character.

2. On the Tools menu, click Spelling And Grammar.

NOTE: You may have to repeat these steps for each spelling or grammar error
contained in the hidden text.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed
above.
