SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 1, named pipe clients may be unable
to get sponsor connections to the computer running SNA Server. When you start
the SnaBase service on an SNA Server Windows NT 3.x client configured to use
Microsoft Networking (Named Pipes), the following error message appears:

   SNA Server - Error # 1003

   SNABase Could Not open Sponsor Connection To Server <servername>.

This problem does not occur if the sponsor connection is configured to a SNA
Server 3.0 Server (Service Pack 1 not applied) or if TCP/IP is selected in the
"Select Client/Server Protocol for Client Setup" dialog box on the client.

NOTE: This error message can appear for other reasons as well.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 1 update program updates the NullSessionPipes
registry value, but fails to correctly add null- termination to the end of the
last entry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\ 
   CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ 
   NullSessionPipes:REG_MULTI_SZ:

   COMNAP
   COMNODE
   SQL\QUERY
   SPOOLSS
   LLSRPC
   EPMAPPER
   LOCATOR
   COMPROXY
   COMNETM

The last character of the last entry has been truncated, and is missing the
terminating carriage return.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ 

3. Double-click NullSessionPipes.

4. Change the last entry to COMNETMN and press ENTER.

5. Click OK.

6. Perform a shutdown and restart of Windows NT for the change to take effect.

STATUS
======

was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For
