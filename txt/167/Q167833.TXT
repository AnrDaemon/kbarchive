======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

After a long period of inactivity, you may receive a message that the TCP/IP
connection to the server has been disconnected.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the session has been inactive for a long period of
time and the KeepAliveTime time setting has expired.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

To resolve this issue, add a key to the registry to increase the default value of
the KeepAliveTime setting.

The entry described in this article does not normally exist in the Windows 95
registry, and must be added to the following registry key:

   Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP
      KeepAliveTime = <32-bit number>

This entry is a Dword value that specifies the connection idle time in
milliseconds before TCP begins sending keepalive packets, if keepalive packets
are enabled on a connection. The default is 2 hours (7,200,000).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 does not send keepalive packets after the KeepAliveTime value
expires. Increasing the KeepAliveTime value keeps the connection open for a
longer period of time.
