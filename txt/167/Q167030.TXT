TITLE   :XCLN: Using Exchange Client with IE Dial When Needed (AutoDial)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible for a Microsoft Exchange Client computer to connect successfully
to a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server on a local LAN while still
leaving the option for Internet Explorer to Dial When Needed (AutoDial) and not
prompt for a dial-up networking dialog box. The dial-up connection dialog box is
called because of initialization of the TCP/IP protocol on the local machine. It
is possible to connect from a Microsoft Exchange Client to a Microsoft Exchange
Server without using TCP/IP, provided that you can configure both computers to
use a different protocol.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To connect Microsoft Exchange Client to the server without being prompted for a
dial-up connection, perform the following steps:

1. Upgrade Microsoft Exchange Client to Service Pack 2 or later and follow the
   instructions for adding an entry to the Mapiscv.inf:

   Q152344 XCLN: Winsock Application Starts When Microsoft Exchange Client
   Starts

2. Create a new Microsoft Exchange Server profile. For more information on
   creating a profile see "Creating or Deleting a Profile" in the Microsoft
   Exchange Client online help.

3. Install NetBEUI or IPX/SPX on the Microsoft Exchange Client and on the
   computer running Microsoft Exchange Server.

4. Change the RPC_binding_order so TCP/IP is not being called. Change
   RPC_binding_order for all of your clients to include only the entry for
   ncacn_nb_nb or ncacn_spx. The first entry will use NetBIOS rather than
   NetBEUI and should allow you to connect to the server. The second entry will
   use IPX/SPX to connect the client to the server.

Note: NetBEUI is not a routable protocol; IPX/SPX is a routable protocol.

After completing the above steps, you can leave the Dial When Needed option
enabled in Internet Explorer. When you start the Microsoft Exchange Client you
will not be prompted for a dial-up connection.
