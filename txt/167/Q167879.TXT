TITLE   :WD97: Can't Run OCX Control After Converting to Inline Object
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbtool word8 word97

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you convert an OCX control (for example, a command button) that has

Visual Basic for Applications code attached to the control event procedure, from
a floating object to an inline object, you cannot run, edit, or view the code.

NOTE: To convert an object from a floating object to an inline object, select the
object. On the Edit menu, point to "<Object Type> Object," click Convert,
and then click to clear or select the Float Over Text check box.

CAUSE
=====

When you convert the OCX control from a floating object to an inline object, the
Name property of the OCX control changes. As a result, the Visual Basic for
Applications code is no longer associated with the event procedure.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use these steps:

1. On the View menu, point to Toolbars, and click Control Toolbox.

2. Select the control. Click the Properties button on the Control Toolbox.

3. In the Properties window, change the Name property to its original name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
