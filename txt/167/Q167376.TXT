SYMPTOMS

Expand a new copy of the Ntprint.dll file from the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM to the
%SystemRoot%\System32 folder using the following steps:

1. If an Ntprint.dll file already exists in the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder,
   rename it to Ntprint.old.

2. Place the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive.

3. Type the following line at a command prompt:

   expand d:\i386\ntprint.dl_ c:\winnt\system32\ntprint.dll

   NOTE: This article assumes that Windows NT is installed in the Winnt folder on
   drive C and that the CD-ROM drive is drive D. If this is not the case, adjust
   the command as necessary.
