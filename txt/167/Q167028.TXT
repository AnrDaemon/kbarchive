TITLE   :XCLN: Err Msg: The Properties for This Item Are Not Available
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to get the properties of the Microsoft Exchange Client Inbox,
you receive the following error message:

   The properties for this item are not available.

Note: You may be able to bring up the Exchange properties via the Mail and Fax
icon in Control Panel even though right-clicking the inbox results in the above
error message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Mlshext.dll file is corrupted or missing from
the Microsoft Exchange Client program directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, copy the Mlshext.dll file from the Windows 95 disks
using the Windows 95 Extract tool. The Mlshext.dll file is contained in the
Microsoft Windows 95 client setup cabinet file, Exchng2.cab, or in the Windows
95 setup cabinet file, Win95_06.cab. By default, the Microsoft Exchange Client
is installed in the following directory, and that is where this file should be
copied to:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Exchange\


For information about using the Extract tool, type "Extract" at a Windows 95
command prompt, or see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
