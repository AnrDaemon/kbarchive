SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create a custom calling card rule in Windows 95,
Windows NT Server version 4.0, or Windows NT Workstation version 4.0. Calling
card rules can be used with Dial-Up Networking, HyperTerminal, Microsoft Fax,
Phone Dialer, or any other program that uses Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0
telephony.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a custom calling card rule, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Modems.

2. Click Dialing Properties, and then click the Dial Using Calling Card check
   box to select it.

3. Click New, type the name of the calling card in the text box, and then click
   OK.

4. Click Advanced, and then type your calling card rule in the text box for
   which you want to create a rule. Rules can be created for each of the
   following call types:

   - Calls within the same area code
   - Long distance calls
   - International calls

   NOTE: In Windows NT Workstation 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, click Rules
   instead of Advanced.

5. Click Close, click OK, and then click OK again.

If you would like to edit an existing rule from a predefined calling card, click
Copy From in Step 4 and then follow these steps:

1. Click a predefined calling card from the list, and then click OK.

2. Edit the existing calling card rule in the text box for which you want to
   create a rule.

3. Click Close, click OK, and then click OK again.

The following list describes the different dialing codes that can be used when
you are setting up custom calling card rules.

Rules for Dialing
-----------------

0-9: Numbers to be dialed.

ABCD: Characters to be dialed. (Tone dialing only - used for special control on
some phone systems.)

E: Dial the country code.

F: Dial the area code (city code).

G: Dial the local phone number.

H: Dial the card number.

*,#: Characters to be dialed (tone dialing only).

T: Subsequent numbers are to be tone dialed.

P: Subsequent numbers are to be pulse dialed.

,: Pause for a fixed time.

!: Flash (1/2 second on-hook, 1/2 second off-hook).

W: Wait for a second dial tone.

@: Wait for quiet answer (ring-back followed by five seconds of silence).

$: Wait for calling card prompt tone.

?: Suspend dialing until user provides input.

For example, the MCI via 1-800-674-7000 calling card has the following rule for
long distance calls:

   18006747000,,,,,,TH,,FG

This means that the following sequence needs to be dialed in order to place a
long distance call with an MCI calling card:

1. Call 1-800-674-7000.

2. Wait (6 commas).

3. Dial next numbers as tone.

4. Dial the calling card number.

5. Wait (2 commas).

6. Dial the area code.

7. Dial the phone number.
