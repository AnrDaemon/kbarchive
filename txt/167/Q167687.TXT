TITLE   :PAX Command Gives Error "Bad Magic Number"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT posix utility portable archive exchange (pax) gives the following
error when an archive created on a UNIX computer is retrieved.

   pax: [offset 98]: Bad magic number
   pax: <filename> : May be corrupt
   pax: [offset 176]: Apparently resynchronized
   pax: <filename> : Continuing

CAUSE
=====

The above error is obtained when the rsh command is used to remotely carry out
pax on a UNIX host and redirect the output file to the local Windows NT
computer.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use the rcp command to copy the archived file from
the remote UNIX host to the local Windows NT computer.

1. Use the following command to create the archive file on the remote host:

   Rsh unixhost -l root -n pax -w -x cpio -f archive.file file*

2. Use rcp to copy the archive file from the remote host in binary format:

   rcp -b host.user:archive.file .

3. Use pax to retrieve files:

   Pax -r -f archive.file

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5, 3.51,
and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
