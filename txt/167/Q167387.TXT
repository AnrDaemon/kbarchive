SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Visual Basic for Applications WordBasic object in combination
with the WordBasic Files$() command and a path that includes spaces, the return
value will contain quotation marks. If you attempt to use this return value with
another command, you will receive the following error message:

   Run-time error '76': "Path not found."

Use one of the following methods to work around this problem:

Method 1: Remove the extra quotation marks
------------------------------------------

The following Visual Basic for Applications subroutine, "GetWordBasicPath,"
retrieves the current path using the WordBasic File$() command. It then calls
the function, "RemoveQuotes," that checks to see if the path begins with a
quotation mark. If it does, the function strips the beginning and ending
quotation marks from the path and returns the value to the calling subroutine.
If the path does not contain quotation marks, the original value is returned.

      Sub GetWordBasicPath()
         Dim sPath As String
         sPath = RemoveQuotes(WordBasic.Files$("."))
         MsgBox sPath
      End Sub

      Function RemoveQuotes(sPath As String)
      ' ***********************************************
      ' This function strips extra quotation marks from
      ' the return value when using the WordBasic
      ' Files$() command.
      ' ***********************************************
         ' If the value starts with a quotation mark...
         If Left$(sPath, Length:=1) = Chr$(34) Then
            ' ...remove opening and closing quotation marks.
            RemoveQuotes = Mid$(sPath, Start:=2, Length:=Len(sPath) - 2)
         Else
            ' ...otherwise, return the value as is.
            RemoveQuotes = sPath
         End If
      End Function

Method 2. Use Visual Basic for Applications equivalent commands
---------------------------------------------------------------

In Visual Basic for Applications, use the CurDir and/or the Dir functions instead
of the WordBasic object. When you use either of these functions, the value
returned does not contain quotation marks. The following example code does not
enclose the current path in quotation marks when it stores it in the variable,
MyPath:

      Dim MyPath As String
      MyPath = CurDir

For more information about the Dir Function, from the Visual Basic Editor, click
the Office Assistant, type "Dir Function" (without the quotation marks), click
Search, and then click to view "Dir Function."

For more information about the CurDir Function, from the Visual Basic Editor,
click the Office Assistant, type "CurDir Function" (without the quotation
marks), click Search, and then click to view "CurDir Function."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
