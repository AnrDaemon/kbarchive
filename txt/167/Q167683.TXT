TITLE   :SMS: Audit32 Causes an Access Violation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAudit smsaudit

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to run the Audit package on a Windows NT client, the following
Audit32.exe application error is produced:

   The instruction as "0x00000000" referenced memory at "0x00000000". The memory
   could not be read.

CAUSE
=====

During the execution of Audit32.exe, the program attempts to make a call to the
Ismif32.dll file, which is located in the SystemRoot directory. This file is
used to produce a status MIF for the Audit program. If the Ismif32.dll file
cannot be found, an access violation (AV) is produced.

There are two situations in which the Ismif32.dll file will not be present:

 - The Ismif32.dll file may not be present if the Package Command Manager (PCM)
   has been disabled in the client's site properties. This may be where the PCM
   service is in use on a Windows NT client, and PCMWIN32 does not require
   distribution by means of Systems Management Server client setup. ISMIF32
   requires Package Command Manager to be enabled in the client site properties.

 - The Ismif32.dll file may not be present if a Systems Management Server site
   or logon server has not previously run the Systems Management Server script
   file Smsls.bat or Runsms.bat. In such a case, the Systems Management Server
   client components will not have been installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do any one of the following:

 - Copy the Ismif32.dll and Ismif16.dll files into the <platform.bin>
   directory (for example, either the x86.bin, mips.bin, or alpha.bin directory)
   of the Audit package source, and resend the audit package to clients with the
   send option 'Even if previously sent' and the distribute option 'Refresh
   existing distribution servers' checked.

   -or-

 - If the Clients Site Property for PCM is disabled, enable the property by
   checking the Package Command Manager option in the Clients window of the Site
   Properties.

   -or-

 - If a site or logon server exhibits the failure, manually run Runsms.bat from
   the server's own SMS_SHR.

STATUS
======

1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems Management
Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack,
