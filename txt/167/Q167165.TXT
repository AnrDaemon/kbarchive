======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When compiling, running, or showing a form with too many controls on it, the IDE
may fail (crash) with an error similar to one of the following on Windows 95:

   "This program has caused an illegal operation and will be shut down. If
   the problem persists, contact the program vendor. VB5 caused an invalid
   page fault in module VB5.EXE"

   -or-

   "This program has caused an illegal operation and will be shut down. If
   the problem persists, contact the program vendor. VB5 caused an invalid
   page fault in module VBA5.DLL"

   -or-

   "Error encountered durring load"

Under Windows NT 4.0, an error similar to one of the following may be
encountered:

   "Application Error: The instruction at "0x00417DAA" referenced memory at
   "0x021E41FA". The memory could not be "read". Unhandled exception in
   VB5.EXE 0xC0000005: Access Violation"

   -or-

   "Application Error: The instruction at "0x0FAD85F8" referenced memory at
   "0x01EE0112". The memory could not be "read." Unhandled exception in
   VBA5.DLL 0xC0000005: Access Violation"

The memory addresses above are just examples. The addresses encountered may
vary.

It is also possible for this bug to simply cause the error:

   Error encountered during load

when opening a project that contains Forms with too many controls. This will be
most likely encountered when converting a Visual Basic 4.0 application.

CAUSE
=====

When a project with a form containing too many controls is loaded into Visual
Basic 5.0, you may encounter incorrect name space mapping of controls. This
includes controls that are elements of control arrays. The incorrect mappings
may lead to the above-noted problems in the IDE.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this bug, follow the steps below:

1. Remove any forms that have too many controls from the project.


2. With the project loaded, re-add the forms to the project using the
   "Project\Add File" menu. When you re-add the file in this way, Visual Basic
   correctly handles the naming of the controls.

NOTE: The forms will have to be added individually every time the project is
loaded. Trying to load the entire project will result in error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Windows 98.

This bug has also been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2.
