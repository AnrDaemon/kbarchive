KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The system does not appear to respond to keys pressed at the logon screen
(system beeps), and you are unable to log on.

CAUSE
=====

The FilterKeys Accessibility option has been enabled for the logon session. With
FilterKeys enabled, keys need to be held down for 1 second (default settings)
before the system registers the system registers the keystroke.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, do the following:

1. Press and hold the Control (CTRL) key until the system beeps twice.

2. While still holding the CTRL key, press the ALT key until the system beeps
   twice.

3. While still holding these two keys, press the Delete (DEL) key until the
   password prompt is displayed.

4. To enter your password, hold down each key for two beeps; the asterisk (*) is
   displayed indicating the key has been entered. Then, move on to the next
   character in the password. If you need to use the SHIFT or CTRL key, press
   and hold the key for two beeps before pressing the second key. Use the mouse
   to click OK when the password is entered.

5. After you are logged on, click Start, click Settings, and then click Control
   Panel.

6. Double-click the Accessibility icon, click to remove the check mark from the
   FilterKeys check box, click OK, and then click Yes to the "Do you want to
   save the current settings as the default for new users and the login prompt?"
   dialog box.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After enabling FilterKeys, the user is presented with a dialog box stating:

   Do you want to save the current settings as the default for new users and the
   login prompt?

If you select Yes to this prompt, FilterKeys will be enabled for the logon
session.

If you select no, FilterKeys will be enabled only for the current user's profile;
logging on will not be affected.
