message similar to the following error message:

   BSHELF98 caused an invalid page fault in module BSHELF98.EXE

CAUSE
=====

You have disabled Virtual Memory, or your Windows 95/98 swapfile is too small.

RESOLUTION
==========

To view and change the current swapfile settings, do the following:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System icon.

3. On the Performance tab, click the Virtual Memory button.

4. Select Let Me Specify My Own Virtual Memory Settings.

5. Note the current setting to the right of the "Hard disk" drop down box.

   This number represents the amount of free space on this drive that can be used
   for a swapfile. If this number is too small (under 10 MB, for example), you
   need to choose a different drive that has more available space or you need to
   free up additional disk space on this drive.

6. Once you have made necessary changes such as freeing drive space or changing
   drives, click OK. When you are asked to confirm your changes, click Yes.

7. Click Close. Restart the computer when you are prompted.
