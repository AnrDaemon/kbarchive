SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft FrontPage defaults to using the Domain Name System (DNS) in TCP/IP
networking to identify a computer. If DNS is not active but it is bound to both
TCP/IP and the Client for Microsoft Networks, FrontPage uses the information on
the Identification tab in the Network Neighborhood Properties dialog box. If the
Computer Name and Domain boxes are empty, FrontPage uses whatever the TCP/IP
stack returns.

If your system is not configured properly, "Default" will be used as the server
name. If FrontPage does not recognize the host name for your computer, you can
use "localhost" (without the quotation marks) in place of the original host
name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Run the FrontPage TCP/IP test to verify the host name and IP address for your
computer.

NOTE: The test should indicate that your computer is identified using the name
"Localhost" and that the IP address is 127.0.0.1. To run the TCP/IP test, follow
these steps:

FrontPage 97
------------

1. In Windows Explorer, double-click Tcptest.exe. This file is installed in the
   following folder by default:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft FrontPage\bin

2. Click Start Test.

FrontPage 1.1
-------------

1. On the Start menu, point to Programs, and click Microsoft FrontPage.

2. Click FrontPage TCP_IP Test.

3. Click Start Test.

If the test is successful, Yes appears in all of the boxes. If No appears in any
of the boxes, then you either do not have full network connectivity, or you do
not have a valid TCP/IP configuration.
