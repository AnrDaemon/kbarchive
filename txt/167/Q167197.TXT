TITLE   :XFOR: Using Imcext.dll May Incorrectly Format Message Headers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the IMC Sample Extension DLL (Imcext.dll) included in the Microsoft
Exchange Server 4.0 Technical Resource Kit to reroute messages by way of the
Internet Mail Connector (IMC), messages to some domains may fail, generating
errors in the SMTP protocol log. Depending on the mailer, the result error codes
may be:

   invalid address in SMTP envelope, '<' missing

   -or-

   501 strangeness between : and <

CAUSE
=====

RFC 821 states that all envelope information should be enclosed in angle
brackets. When you use the Imcext.dll in conjunction with the IMC, these
brackets are stripped from the RCPT TO field. This is not a problem with the
majority of SMTP mailers, but some later implementations do not allow this.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the IMC Sample Extension DLL
included in the Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 Technical Resource Kit. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
