TITLE   :WD97: StartConversionWizard Selects Wrong Files to Convert
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Conversion Wizard selects the incorrect file converter when you attempt to
convert files that have a compound file name extension, such as .doc.txt. The
Conversion Wizard runs the StartConversionWizard macro when you open the
Convert8.wiz file, which is located in the \Program Files\Microsoft
Office\Office\Macros subfolder.

RESOLUTION
==========

Method 1. Cancel the selection
------------------------------

1. In the Conversion Wizard, click File Selection.

2. On the File Selection panel, in the To Convert box, double-click the file you
   do not want to convert.

   The file name reappears in the Available box.

3. Click Finish.

Method 2. Rename the file before you run the Conversion Wizard
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. If the Conversion Wizard is running, click Cancel.

2. Rename the file so that it conforms to the 8.3 MS-DOS file-naming
   convention.

   MS-DOS file names consist of an eight-character filename, followed by a
   period(.), followed by a three-character extension (for example,
   Filename.ext).

STATUS
======
