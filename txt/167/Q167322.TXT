The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Visual C++ 4.x after uninstalling Fortran Power Station by
using "del *.*" command, the following error message appears when you start
Developer Studio:

   EEN0SWT.DLL This required file cannot be loaded. Please re-install Microsoft
   Developer Studio -- OK

RESOLUTION
==========

The proper procedure of uninstalling Fortran Power Station(FPS) is to proceed
from the "Microsoft Fortran Power Station Setup" icon in the program group and
click Remove all. This way the necessary files and the proper registry keys are
removed.

Or, if the "del *.*" command is used on the FPS installation directory, the
registry keys are not deleted. Under this circumstance, the error message
appears when you install Visual C++ 4.x and start Developer Studio. Click OK to
start Developer Studio.

To prevent this error message, close Developer Studio and open the Registry
editor. Under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft, delete the Developer key.
Restart Developer Studio. The error message does not appear and the Developer
Registry key is properly restored.
