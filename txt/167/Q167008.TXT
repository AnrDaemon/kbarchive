TITLE   :SMS: Incorrect Workstation Attribute Set in the Setup Column
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDespooler kbPCM smsdespooler smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After sending a package from a central site to a selection of child primary
sites, the packages window at ALL the child sites have a "workstations"
attribute in the setup column (meaning they are ready for distribution to
clients), irrespective of which sites received the distributed package. However,
the package is only usable at the sites with distribution servers that received
the package during the distribute phase.

The package at sites with no distribution server specified in the distribute
phase should not have the workstations attribute in the setup column.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
