TITLE   :SMS: Office 97 Contains Incorrect PDF Format
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbinterop kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) number listed in the Office 97 package
definition file (PDF) for the Off97std.ini file is:

      Off97std.ini      =  0 222 47535

When you import the PDF to create a package, the CRC number listed in the package
is different:

      Off97std.ini      =  0 527152781 257776

It is different because the PDF format is wrong. It needs commas, as in the
following example:

      Off97std.ini      =  0,222,47535


MORE INFORMATION
----------------

Because of this problem with the PDF, software inventory will be unable to
determine whether Office 97 is installed on your clients until you make the
necessary changes to the CRC data in the PDF file itself.
