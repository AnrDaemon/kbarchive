OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbfield

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Word 97 stops responding (hangs) when you open a Word for the
Macintosh, version 5.x, file that contains an If, Ask, or Set field.

The following message appears in the status bar at the bottom of the Word
Window:

   Reading Word for the Macintosh file

This is followed by a progress meter, which indicates that the conversion is
90-percent complete.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR- 1).

To work around this problem, open the file in Word for the Macintosh, remove the
If, Ask, or Set field, save, and close the document. Reopen the file in Word 97
and re-create the If, Ask, or Set field.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 SR-1. This problem has been
corrected for Word 98 for Macintosh.

For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem occurs when you have a field nested inside an IF field. An example
of a nested field would be:

   <<IF quantity => 50>> you will have more than
   <<quantity>> <<endif>>

This problem also occurs if you have a nested ASK or SET field.
