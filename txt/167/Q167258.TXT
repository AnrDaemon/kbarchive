SYMPTOMS
========

After you run Analyze with the -f switch, some files in the data\<a-z>
subdirectories may have an extension of .old.

CAUSE
=====

When Analyze -f finds a corrupt file, it places a copy of that file in the
backup directory, then rewrites the fixed file in the appropriate data\<a-
z> directory. In some cases, after the original rewrite, another rewrite is
necessary. Analyze does not overwrite the copy in the backup directory, but
creates a file with the .old extension in the same directory as the original
file. Under normal operations, this file should be deleted by the Analyze
process. However, in some cases it is not.

For additional information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q160914 PRB: The Data File for <file> (<physical file>) Was Not
   Found


RESOLUTION
==========

It is safe to delete the file with the .old extension.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
