TITLE   :Err Msg: Error Opening Modem.inf File in the RAS Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbhw dun kbHardware kbDialUp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to configure Remote Access Services (RAS) using the Network tool in
Control Panel, you may receive the following error messages:

   Error opening Modem.inf file in the RAS directory.

   Failed to initialize device list. Error opening Modem.inf file in the RAS
   directory.

   Dial-Up Networking Setup encountered an unknown failure and will terminate
   now. Please contact your administrator to determine the cause of the problem.

Dialing out using Dial-Up Networking may work fine, however.

CAUSE
=====

The Modem.inf file in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Ras folder is missing or
damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

Expand a new copy of the Modem.inf file from the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM to the
%SystemRoot%\System32\Ras folder using the following steps:

1. If a Modem.inf file already exists in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Ras folder,
   rename it to Modem.old.

2. Place the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive.

3. Type the following line at a command prompt:

   expand d:\i386\modem.in_ c:\winnt\system32\ras\modem.inf

   NOTE: This command assumes that Windows NT is installed in the Winnt folder on
   drive C and that drive D is the CD-ROM drive. If this is not the case, adjust
   the command as necessary.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 does not use the Modem.inf file for Dial-Up Networking. However,
the Modem.inf file is required for the setup and configuration of modem devices
in RAS properties. If the file is missing or damaged, RAS cannot display the
list of devices.
