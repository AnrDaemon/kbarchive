TITLE   :FIX: VSS Editor/Viewer Removes and Replaces Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500bug kbVS97sp1fix kbVS97sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are editing or viewing a file in Visual SourceSafe, you may notice that
character(s) have been removed from the body of the text and placed at the end.
You may also experience this after doing a Visual Merge.

CAUSE
=====

The default Editor/Viewer in Visual SourceSafe causes this behavior.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 1.

For additional information about the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 1, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q170365 INFO: Visual Studio 97 Service Packs - What, Where, and Why

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual SourceSafe uses its default Editor/Viewer when you edit and view files
without an extension association in Windows. It also uses the default for doing
Visual Merge and the Show Difference command. The integrity of a files is in
jeopardy only when editing or using Visual Merge because the View and Diff
commands do not change the file.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q123470 INFO: How SourceSafe Selects a Viewer for a File

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Add a large text file to Visual SourceSafe. Make sure the file you add is not
   associated with any other editor in Windows. Rename the extension if
   necessary.

2. Right-click the file and choose Edit.

3. Delete any character and then put it back so that the SAVE button is enabled.

4. Save the file.

5. Close the default editor.

6. Next, right-click the file and select Show Differences. Some characters may
   have been removed or replaced to the end of the file.
