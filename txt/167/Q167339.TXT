The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add the New Class to an ATL project, the Wizard removes settings on the
edit interface.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you add a new class object, make sure that interface attributes are set
correctly in the New Class dialog box before you click OK. If you add the class
with the incorrect attributes, you need to edit the header and the idl file
manually.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ATL project using the AppWizard.

2. Get the context menu and click New Class.

3. Enter a name for the class. NOTE: The Edit button is not initially enabled.

4. Click Change, and then Cancel Out to activate the Edit button.

5. Click Custom Interface.

6. Clear the Aggregatable check box.

Observe that the Wizard changed the interface type back to dual, and turned
Aggregatable back on.
