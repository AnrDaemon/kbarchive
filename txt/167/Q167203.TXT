TITLE   :XADM: Directory Import Error - Event ID 286
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, when you import a
directory (on the Tools menu, click Directory Import), errors may occur, and the
following event ID may be logged in the Event Viewer:

   Event ID:   286
   Source:  MSExchangeDSImp
   Type: Error
   Category:   None

   Description: Unable to create object /o=Volcano Coffee/ou=North
   America/cn=Recipients/cn=test/cn=test1 because one or more objects in
   the directory path
   /o=Volcano Coffee/ou=North America/cn=Recipients/cn=test
   do not exist.

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs when the Exchange Server computer to which the directory needs
to be imported has a Recipients container that is not identical to the
Recipients container of the Exchange Server computer from which the directory
was exported.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - In Directory Import dialog box, select Always Use Selected Container. All
   directory objects will be imported into the selected container.

 - Create a recipients container identical to the Microsoft Exchange Server from
   which the directory was exported. Make sure to use the same directory name,
   not necessarily the same display name, in creating the identical recipients
   container. In the above example, create "test" container under "Recipients"
   container.
