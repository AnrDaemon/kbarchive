TITLE   :ACC97: IPF Executing VSS Add and Create Commands at Same Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbAccess kbSSafe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.


SYMPTOMS
========

When you execute a Visual SourceSafe command, you can call other commands from
any enabled button on a floating toolbar, even if a SourceSafe dialog box is
visible on your screen.

If you execute the "Add Database to SourceSafe" and "Create Database from
SourceSafe Project" commands at the same time, you receive one or more of the
following error messages, and then Microsoft Access quits:

   MSACCESS caused an invalid page fault in module MSO97.DLL

   MSACCESS caused an invalid page fault in module SSSCC.DLL

   MSACCESS caused an invalid page fault in module DAO350.DLL

   MSACCESS caused an invalid page fault in module ACCSCC.DLL

   MSACCESS caused an invalid page fault in module MSACCESS.EXE


NOTE: If you click buttons on other floating toolbars while you are executing a
Visual SourceSafe command, you may experience different error messages or
different results.

This article assumes that you are familiar with using the client side
capabilities of Visual SourceSafe. For more information about Visual SourceSafe,
please refer to the "Visual SourceSafe User's Guide" or the Help topics
available from the Visual SourceSafe Help menu.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can minimize your chances of encountering this error when you work with
Visual SourceSafe if you dock all your toolbars. Once a toolbar is docked, you
may want to modify its properties to prevent it from being detached:

1. On the View menu, point to Toolbars, and then click Customize.

2. In the Customize dialog box, click the Toolbars tab, and then select the
   toolbar you want to prevent from floating.

3. Click the Properties button.

4. In the Toolbar Properties dialog box, click to clear the Allow Moving check
   box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

WARNING: Following these steps will cause a page fault on your computer. Make
sure you save and close any open work on your computer before following these
steps.

The following example assumes that you have the Microsoft Access Source Code
Control component of Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools installed, and
that you are using Microsoft Visual SourceSafe as your source code control
program.

1. Start Microsoft Access and create a new, blank database called Vss.mdb.

2. On the View menu, point to Toolbars, and then click Customize.

3. In the Customize dialog box, click the New button.

4. In the New Toolbar dialog box, type MyToolbar in the Toolbar name box, and
   then click OK. A new, empty toolbar appears. Position the new toolbar and the
   Customize dialog box so you can see them both on your screen at the same
   time.

5. Click the Commands tab in the Customize dialog box.

6. Select Source Code Control in the Categories box, and then drag "Create
   Database from SourceSafe Project" from the Commands box to the new toolbar.
   Then drag "Add Database to SourceSafe" from the Commands box to the new
   toolbar.

7. Click Close in the Customize dialog box.

8. Click "Create Database from SourceSafe Project" on the new toolbar. The
   Visual SourceSafe Login dialog box appears.

9. Click "Add Database to SourceSafe" on the new toolbar.

10. Respond to prompts and dialog boxes from both commands in turn as they
   appear, and note that the page fault error(s) occurs.
