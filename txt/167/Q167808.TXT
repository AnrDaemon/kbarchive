======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

NetWare logon servers in a Systems Management Server site may go inactive or
fail to be installed, even though the Systems Management Server service account
has adequate permissions, there is plenty of free space on the specified NetWare
volume, and network connectivity is available. This will result in inventory
from clients not being reported up to the site server, packages not being
distributed, and other problems normally associated with account permissions,
disk space, or connectivity problems.

CAUSE
=====

The Site Server's Site Configuration Manager (SCMAN) may not be able to
correctly enumerate the volume name specified in order to verify or install the
Systems Management Server logon server components. This occurs because of a
problem with the NetWare 3.1x logon server's bindery.

Viewing the Scman.log file from the Site Server reveals that it is able to locate
and identify the server, but is unable to enumerate the volume name specified
for Systems Management Server installation or verification.

In the following log excerpt, the number of shares (volumes) reported is
incorrect (note that the number reported may also be 0):

   Server SERVER1 has 171 shares
   Server SERVER1 status Pending Install role 0x12
   Server SERVER1 has 11 inboxes; 0 domain master inboxes; 0 components

Site Configuration Manager attempts to identify the volume (VOL1) specified in
the site properties, but is unable to locate it, as reflected in this portion of
the Scman.log file:

   Checking for share SMS and directory \\SERVER1\VOL1\SMS\logon.srv on SERVER1;
   no share

Directory creation is attempted, but it fails:

      CSharedDirInstallItem::Install share=, vol=, dir=SMS\logon.srv,
      subDiraccess=3, share access=2
      Created directory \\SERVER1\VOL1\SMS\logon.srv
      share not found, cannot create without share path

An event 223 is logged:

      Event 223 logged with error 183 and object (SERVER1); GetLastError 183;
      SiteConfig Mgr code 7404.
      Cannot create inboxes (Application Control Database, Application Control
      INI, Application Control Script, Client Installation, Despooler,
      Inventory Agent, Inventory Processor, ISV MIF Collection, MS Test,
      Package Command Instruction, Package Source) on server SERVER1

The logon server remains inactive.

Another way to test for this condition is to browse the volume list of a NetWare
3.1x server from an computer running Windows NT Server (for example, the site
server) running Gateway (Client) Services for NetWare. If the volume requested
by Site Configuration Manager is not visible in the browse list, SCMAN will not
be able to create the directories on the volume, even though it has adequate
permissions and connectivity and the volume has enough free space. Note that
client computers running MS-DOS, Windows 3.x, or Windows 95 do not experience
this problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, run the NetWare server BINDFIX utility for NetWare
3.1x, and DSREPAIR for NetWare 4.x. Resetting the bindery context may also be
helpful. For more information on these utilities, consult the documentation
provided with your Novell NetWare product.
