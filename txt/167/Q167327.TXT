TITLE   :WinNT Servers Can Join Workgroups or Domains without Reinstall
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

From the Windows NT 4.0 Windows.hlp Help File (Workgroups | To join a workgroup)
the last paragraph states:

   "If you're working from a computer running Windows NT Server, you cannot join
   a different workgroup. Reinstall Windows NT Server to join a different
   workgroup."

MORE INFORMATION
================

This statement is incorrect. It should say that Windows NT Servers CAN join
different workgroups or domains without reinstalling.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows NT version 4.0
WINDOWS.HLP file. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
