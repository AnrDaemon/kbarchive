PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are unable to set up a new Custom Recipient. This command is not available
on the File menu in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.

CAUSE
=====

You are using the standard edition of Exchange Server and you have not installed
any Microsoft Exchange Connectors on this computer running Exchange Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

 - Install the Microsoft Exchange Server Enterprise Edition, which includes
   three connectors: Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector, Microsoft
   Exchange Connector, Microsoft Exchange X.400 Connector.

-OR-

 - Install any of the connectors from the Microsoft Exchange Connector Series
   (Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector, Microsoft Exchange Connector, or
   Microsoft Exchange X.400 Connector).

 - If there is no need for this Exchange Server computer to use any type of
   connector, users can use a shared .pab file that will reside on a server.
   This will allow users or the administrator to add foreign mail addresses to
   be used globally.
