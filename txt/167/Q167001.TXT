TITLE   :Winmsd.exe May Show Invalid Drive Statistics in Reports
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT Diagnostics utility, Winmsd.exe, may show invalid drive
statistics in a saved or printed report. This can occur for drives where the
product of bytes per sector multiplied by sectors per cluster is smaller than
1,024.

CAUSE
=====

When generating a report, the Winmsd.exe diagnostic utility shows drive
statistics in kilobytes and not in bytes, as it does on the Drives tab. When
calculating the total and free disk space of a drive, it uses the following
formula:

   ((bytes per sector * sectors per cluster) / 1024)

If the product of bytes per sector and sectors per cluster is smaller than 1,024,
the result equals 0, and the drives report will show 0 KB as both total and free
disk space. This may happen with small NTFS partitions where bytes per sector
equals 512 and sectors per cluster equals 1. However, the Drives tab does
display the correct statistics.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
