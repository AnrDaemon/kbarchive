TITLE   :XADM: Incorrect Status for Storage Limits in Mailbox Resources
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT: 4.0, 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you add the Storage Limits column to Mailbox Resources in the properties for
the Private Information Store, the status of the mailboxes that reach the
Prohibit Send limit is reported incorrectly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

On the General tab for the Private Information Store Properties you can choose
to set an Issue Warning limit and a Prohibit Send limit. On the Mailbox
Resources tab you can click the Columns button and add the Storage Limits
column. This column reports a status, depending on the amount of storage space
used by each mailbox. These are:

 - Below Limit: The mailbox is below the Issue Warning limit indicated on the
   General tab of the Private Information Store Properties.

 - Issue Warning: The mailbox has reached or surpassed the Issue Warning limit,
   but is lower than the Prohibit Send limit.

 - Prohibit Send: The mailbox has reached or surpassed the Prohibit Send limit.

 - No Checking: There are no limits set on the General tab of the Private
   Information Store Properties.

If you add the Storage Limits column to Mailbox Resources, the Prohibit Send
status will not show until the mailbox has reached the Issue Warning limit plus
the Prohibit Send limit. For example, if you set an Issue Warning limit of 5000K
and a Prohibit Send limit of 7000K, then the Prohibit Send status will not show
in the Storage Limits column until the mailbox reaches 12000K in size.

The Issue Warning status works correctly, and any mailbox that reaches the
Prohibit Send limit is prevented from sending any messages. This is only a
status reporting problem.
