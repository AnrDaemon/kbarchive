The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to a share on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT
version 4.0 through a UNC name, you may receive one of the following error
messages:

   The directory is not a subdirectory of the root directory

-or-

   Application Execution Error

   Access to the specified device, path or file is denied.

This occurs only when you connect to a share on a Windows NT version 4.0 NTFS
partition from a Windows NT version 3.51 client, using one of the applications
listed at the beginning of this article.

These symptoms may also occur in Systems Management Server with a Windows NT 3.51
Systems Management Server site server and a Windows NT 4.0 logon or distribution
server. An Error 144 may be seen in the Maintman.log file when Systems
Management Server checks for free disk space on the logon or distribution
server.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, perform one of the following steps:

 - Map a network drive to the share.

   - or-

 - Rather than sharing a folder off another subfolder, share the folder that
   resides directly off the root drive.

   - or -

 - In Program Manager, click File, and then type the UNC path and filename to
   the document.

   - or -

 - Upgrade the Windows NT version 3.51 clients to Windows NT version 4.0.

   - or -

 - Upgrade the Microsoft Office 95 clients to Microsoft Office 97 because this
   problem does not occur in Office 97.
