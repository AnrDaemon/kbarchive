TITLE   :STOP 0x00000050 in Srv.sys When Shutting Down Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you log on to a computer running Windows NT Server or Workstation and then
immediately shutting down the system, you may receive a STOP: 0x00000050 in
Srv.sys. The parameters may look like the following:

   STOP 0x00000050 (0xf08c5f51, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000).

NOTE: The first parameter will always have the same value, but that value depends
on where Srv.sys loads on the system.

CAUSE
=====

A shutdown handler was registered by Srv.sys, which runs after srv.sys has
already been unloaded from the system. Because Srv.sys has been unloaded, you
will see a STOP 0x50. This may generally happen on multiprocessor computers with
more than two network adapters installed in the system.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
