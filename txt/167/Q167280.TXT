TITLE   :XFOR: Err Msg: Cannot Open, HTTP/1.0 500 Server Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an Internet browser to log on to Microsoft Exchange Server, you are
prompted to enter your user name and password. When you type the correct name
and password, one of the following two error messages may appear:

   Cannot open http://<server_name>/exchange/logon.asp

   HTTP/1.0 500 Server Error (Not enough storage is available to process this
   command.)

CAUSE
=====

The first error message appears when only basic (clear text) password
authentication is being used, or when all three authentication methods (basic,
anonymous, and Windows NT challenge/Response) are in use. Using all three is the
default.

The second error message appears if anonymous authentication, Windows NT
challenge/response authentication, or both are being used without basic
authentication.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - Check the security permissions on the file Exchsrvr\Bin\Amhtml.dll and verify
   that the group Everyone has a minimum access level of Read.

   To assign full control (or any other combination of rights) to the group
   Everyone.

 - In Windows Explorer, right-click the Exchsrvr directory and click Properties,
   and then click Security, and then Permissions.
