TITLE   :DHCP May Not Assign a Default Gateway to Windows NT Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have configured a domain host configuration protocol (DHCP) server to
provide a default gateway by using DHCP option 003 (router), Windows NT DHCP
clients on the network receive a valid DHCP lease and all other DHCP lease
options except the default gateway.

CAUSE
=====

The DHCP option 003 (router) option was configured with a value that is not on
the local subnet.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, configure a valid value for this option. The default
gateway for any computer running IP must be on that computer's local subnet.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Client computers running Windows 95 will accept an invalid default gateway and
place it in the route table. Windows NT clients check the value they receive; if
it is not on the local subnet, they will disregard the value.

NOTE: Windows 2000, Windows 98, and Windows Millenium accept the incorrect
gateway address, add it to their routing table and display it.

In addition to the blank default gateway field, Windows NT clients also exhibit
odd behaviour when releasing and renewing a lease with an invalid default
gateway address. The client will appear to release correctly but will retain its
settings and display them. When a renew is attempted, the client fails with a
Error: 10065: renewing adapter "xxxxxx". The only way to properly renew the
address is to reboot the client.
