-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document that contains a drawing object or an AutoShape filled
with a pattern, the pattern is printed smaller than expected and may appear to
be shading rather than a pattern.

NOTE: This problem may occur when you print to a PCL or a PostScript printer.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the following steps to decrease the printer resolution when you print the
document:

1. Open the document containing the filled pattern drawing or AutoShape objects.

2. On the File menu, click Print.

3. In the Print dialog box, click Properties.

4. Click the Graphics tab.

5. Change the Resolution box to a lower value; for example, change it to 150
   dots per inch, and then click OK.

6. Click OK to close the print dialog box and to print the document.
