SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from a Windows 95 workstation on a Token Ring, Ethernet, or
Windows NT network to a printer shared on a Novell NetWare print server or a
Windows NT network-based server, you may experience the following symptoms,
which occur in sequence, on an intermittent basis:

 - Printing stops responding (hangs) for a short period of time.

 - The Printing dialog box displays a spool32 error message.

 - The print job is usually printed correctly.

 - When the workstation recovers from the hung state, there are no printers
   listed in the Printers folder. The next time you attempt to print, you may
   receive the following error message:

   There is no default printer.
   To install and select a default printer, click the Start button, point to
   Settings, click Printers, and then double-click Add Printer.

When you restart the computer, the printers are displayed in the Printers folder
again.
