MORE INFORMATION
================

To install support for the MS Mail 3.x Fax Gateway, follow the following steps:

1. Using the Exchange Administration Import function, import the Fax.csv file
   located on the Exchange Client CD in the TPL folder or on the Exchange Server
   CD in \Setup\<platform>\Tpl\Usa\Fax.csv.

2. Open the Microsoft Mail Connector's Properties page and click the Address
   Space tab.

3. Click the New General button, and add following address space to the
   Microsoft Mail Connector:

      Type: FAX
      Address: <blank>
      Cost: 1

4. Install the Fax Gateway access component on the Exchange Server shadow
   postoffice pointing toward the MS Mail Fax Gateway of choice.

5. Stop and restart the MS Mail Connector Interchange service.

6. Recalculate routing.

7. Exit and restart the Microsoft Exchange Client.

8. Go to Compose and click To.

9. Click New. There should now be a Fax template available to the Exchange
   Client(s). The mail that uses the Fax template should be forwarded through
   the MS Mail Connector to the MS Mail postoffice where the Fax Gateway
   software is installed and configured.

For more information on importing address templates, please read "Importing
Address Templates for Third-Party Mail Systems" in Section 7.2.7 of the Exchange
