SYMPTOMS
========

If an application contains at least two forms and one of those forms is
displayed modally by using a PopupMenu on another form, a PopupMenu on the modal
form will not be displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

A Timer control can be used to work around this problem:

1. Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is added by default.

2. Add a Timer control (Timer1) to Form1.

3. Add another form (Form2) to the project.

4. On Form1, create a menu (mnuFile) with a caption of "File" that has a submenu
   (mnuOpen) with a caption of "Open." On Form2, create a menu (mnuEdit) with a
   caption of "Edit" that has a submenu (mnuFind) with a caption of "Find."

5. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Timer1.Enabled = False
            Timer1.Interval = 1
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Click()
            PopupMenu mnuFile
         End Sub

         Private Sub Timer1_Timer()
            Form2.Show 1
            Timer1.Enabled = False
         End Sub

         Private Sub mnuOpen_Click()
            Timer1.Enabled = True
         End Sub

6. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form2:

         Private Sub Form_Click()
            PopupMenu mnuEdit
         End Sub

7. Press the F5 key to run the program. Click on Form1 and the Open PopupMenu
   will be displayed. Click on the Open PopupMenu and Form2 is shown modally.
   Click on Form2 and the Edit PopupMenu is displayed.
