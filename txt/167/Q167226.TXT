TITLE   :XFOR: Notes Color Graphics Appear Monochrome in Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5

KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message containing an "encapsulated bitmap" from Lotus Notes to
Microsoft Exchange Server, the corresponding bitmap appears as monochrome when
the message is received.

CAUSE
=====

The LinkAge Exchange Notes Connector uses a Notes API call to convert Notes mail
documents to Rich Text Format (RTF). This occurs so that font attributes and
graphics are preserved when a message is sent to Exchange. This problem exists
only for Notes "encapsulated bitmaps" such as the ones appearing in Notes Help,
and any images pasted as bitmaps into Notes documents. Graphics embedded in
Notes documents that are pasted in a non- Notes format (pasted as Picture, as
PaintShop Pro Image, and so on) will retain their color mappings.


In Notes R3, copying a bitmap to the clipboard generates a Rich Text object. This
allows you to copy all data within a Notes document (including multiple bitmaps,
metafiles, and text runs) to the clipboard at one time.

When the bitmap is converted to Rich Text, the resulting object may be
monochrome, due to a limitation in RTF.

NOTE: The conversion to monochrome is not a Notes problem, but a clipboard
problem.
