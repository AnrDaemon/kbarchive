TITLE   :PRB: Failing SQLExec() Breaks Connection with Oracle Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbvfp kbvfp300 kbvfp300b kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Oracle 7.3 ODBC Driver (version 1.15.0301) provided by Oracle
Corporation to connect to an Oracle server, if an SQLExec() call encounters an
error, the connection to the server is no longer valid. Issuing subsequent
SQLExec() calls after a previous command has failed results in the following
error:

   Connectivity error. [Oracle][ODBC Oracle Driver]Operation cancelled.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem occurs only with the Oracle 7.3 ODBC driver provided by Oracle
Corporation. Using the Visigenic Oracle ODBC Driver (version 2.00.0000) or the
Microsoft Oracle ODBC Driver (version 2.00.006325) works correctly. This problem
does not occur in Visual FoxPro version 5.0 or 5.0a.

NOTE: As of 12/9/98, Visigenic has been acquired by INPRISE, Inc.

   Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an ODBC data source using the Oracle 7.3 ODBC driver.

2. Connect to this data source using the SQLConnect() function:

         Handle=SQLConnect(<Oracle DSN>,<user id>,<password>)

3. Send an invalid SQL statement to the Oracle server:

         =SQLExec(Handle,"This is an invalid SQL command")

4. Send a valid SQL statement to the Oracle server.

   The SQLExec function returns a -1 indicating an error.
