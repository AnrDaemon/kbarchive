TITLE   :Certain Bitmap Fonts May Cause STOP 0x1E Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Certain applications running on Windows NT that use bitmap fonts may cause
Windows NT version 4.0 to have a STOP 0x0000001E error. The following parameters
may be returned with the Stop error:

   STOP 0x0000001E(0xc0000005, 0x80131c41, 0x00000000, 0x00000008)

Testing has found that this error may occur with the ATI Ultra 32 and any S3
Video Adapters.

CAUSE
=====

Bytes in the bitmap font that are normally ignored and should have been masked
out, were not and, therefore, caused a miscalculation in the display font
handler.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
