======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to perform a DriveSpace 3 upgrade on a 1.44-MB floppy disk
compressed with a previous version of DoubleSpace or DriveSpace in a 120-MB
drive, the DriveSpace 3 upgrade may not succeed.

CAUSE
=====

DriveSpace does not prompt you for the type of media in the drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the upgrade is not successful, data from the floppy disk may be in any of the
following locations:

 - The host of the unmounted compressed volume file (CVF).

 - The Drvspace.000 CVF.

 - The Dblspace.030 or Drvspace.030 CVF.

To recover data from the host of the unmounted CVF, or from the Drvspace.000,
Dblspace.030, or Drvspace.030 CVF, insert the floppy disk in the 1.44-MB floppy
disk drive A or B. Then, copy any data files from the floppy disk to a folder on
the hard disk.

To recover data in the unmounted Drvspace.000 CVF in the root folder of the
floppy disk, use the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
   System Tools, and then click DriveSpace.

2. Click the drive letter of the inserted floppy.

3. On the Advanced menu, click Mount.

4. Copy the data from the compressed floppy disk to a folder on the hard disk.

5. On Advanced menu, click Unmount.

To recover data in either the unmounted Dblspace.030 or Drvspace.030 CVF, use the
following steps:

1. At a command prompt, change the attributes of the Drvspace.030 or
   Dblspace.030 file in the root folder of the floppy disk. To do so, change to
   the root folder of the floppy disk and then type the following line

   attrib -s -h -r <filename>

   where <filename> is either Dblspace.030 or Drvspace.030.

2. Copy the Dblspace.030 or Drvspace.030 file to the root of an uncompressed
   hard disk.

3. In DriveSpace, click the drive letter that the Dblspace.030 or Drvspace.030
   file was copied to.

4. On the Advanced menu, click Mount.

5. Copy the data from the floppy disk to a folder on the hard disk.

6. On Advanced menu, click Unmount.

STATUS
======
