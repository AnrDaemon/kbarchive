SYMPTOMS
========

Trying to perform a new or parallel installation of Windows NT 4.0 may result in
the following error:

   STOP: 0x00000050 (0xF000B682,0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000002)

CAUSE

This error may occur if you try to perform a clean installation of Windows NT
4.0 using a modified Disk 2 of the three disk installation set that contains the
Setupdd.sys file from Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do either of the following:

 - Replace the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 copy of the Setupdd.sys file
   located on Disk 2 with the original version of Setupdd.sys.

   -or-

 - Create new floppy installation disks, by using the WINNT /OX or WINNT32 /OX
   commands.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Copying Setupdd.sys from Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 to Disk 2 is a common
scenario when trying to repair a computer running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2.
Although this procedure works fine for a repair or an in- place upgrade, it does
not work for a new installation of Windows NT 4.0.
