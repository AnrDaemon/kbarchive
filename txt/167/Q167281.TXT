TITLE   :XADM: Err Msg: Error Encountered Accessing Registry Keys/Values
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run EDBUTIL.EXE /D or EDBUTIL.EXE /R and you use the registry switches
of /DS, /IS, /ISPRIV, or /ISPUB to specify the location for the database, the
following error message may appear:

   Error encountered accessing registry keys/values for specified
   Exchange store.

   Operation terminated with error -1907

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when EDBUTIL is running on a computer other than the one
Microsoft Exchange Server is installed on. When you run EDBUTIL /R, the registry
switches /DS or /IS must be used to specify the database name. Thus, if you want
to use the registry switches to specify the database name, you must run EDBUTIL
/R from the Exchange Server computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To run EDBUTIL /D or EDBUTIL /D /R on a non-Exchange Server computer:

 - Explicitly specify the database path and name after the /D switch, as in the
   following example:

   EDBUTIL /D c:\exchsrvr\dsadata\dir.edb

   When you run EDBUTIL with both the /D and the /R switch, the database path and
   name must be placed after the /D switch and before the /R switch, as in the
   following example:

   EDBUTIL /D c:\exchsrvr\mdbdata\priv.edb /R

CAUTION: Running EDBUTIL can remove damaged data that might be required for the
operation of the service and might not be recoverable. Always back up the
original database file before running Edbutil.
