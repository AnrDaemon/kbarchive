SYMPTOMS
========

   An unexpected error has occurred.

CAUSE

WordPerfect does not require .doc file name extensions. File name extensions for
documents in WordPerfect are optional.

If a WordPerfect subdocument does not have a .doc file name extension, then Word
does not know how to handle the document.

Rename the WordPerfect subdocuments so that they have a .doc file name
extension.

the beginning of this article.
