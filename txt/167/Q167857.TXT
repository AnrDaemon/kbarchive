TITLE   :SMS: Permission Required Dialog Box Appears Behind Open Windows
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to Remote Control a previously remote controlled client
computer running Windows 95 with the Permission Required Help Desk option
enabled, the Remote Control Agent dialog box that asks, "Will you allow
<Administrator'> to remote control your machine?" appears behind open
windows on the desktop. Consequently, the user may not be able to see the dialog
box and answer the prompt without minimizing all open windows.

On the remote control server, the following dialog box appears:

   SMS Remote Control
   The user did not grant permission before the timeout period elapsed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, minimize all open windows before initiating a
second Remote Control session.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
