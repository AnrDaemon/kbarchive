TITLE   :FIX: MFC Application Hangs on Multiprocessor Machine
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0

KEYWORDS:kbMFC kbThread kbVC500bug kbVS97sp1fix kbGrpDSMFCATL kbNoUpdate

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run some multithreaded MFC applications, the computer may hang if
threads are created and terminated very quickly. This is most likely to happen
when the application is run on high-performance multiprocessor computers (4+
processors at 200+ MHz). However, this problem could occur on any machine. This
problem only occurs when you use the DLL version of MFC.

CAUSE
=====

MFC maintains a global list of thread local storage (TLS). As threads are
created and terminated, MFC adds or removes a node of TLS tracking information
to this list. This list is not protected from simultaneous thread access and
under the conditions described above, corruption of this list can occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 1.

For additional information about the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 1, please see
