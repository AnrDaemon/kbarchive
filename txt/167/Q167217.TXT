SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a Word 97 document that contains an IncludePicture field with a \d
switch in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) format, the /d switch moves to the
front of the field.

For example, if your document contains the following field:

      {INCLUDEPICTURE "C:\\Clipart\\1STPLACE.WMF" \d }

and you convert the document to HTML, the field looks will like this:

      {INCLUDEPICTURE \d  "file:///C:/Clipart/1STPLACE.WMF" }

The placement of the \d switch does not affect the appearance of the picture. The
field switch can be located anywhere inside the field braces ({}).

NOTE: By design, the backslash (\) characters change to slash mark (/) characters
when you convert the document.
