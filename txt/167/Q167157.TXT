The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to Netcom using Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking, the
connection may be denied even though it appears you supplied the correct name
and password.

CAUSE
=====

The Netcom online service requires "us,ppp," characters as a prefix to your user
name.

RESOLUTION
==========

To include the "us,ppp," character as a prefix to your user name, follow these
steps:

1. Double-click My Computer, and then double-click Dial-Up Networking.

2. Double-click the connection icon for Netcom.

3. In the User Name box, insert the "us,ppp," characters at the beginning of
   your user name. For example:

   us,ppp,<username>

4. If appropriate, type your password in the Password box.

5. Click Connect.

Note that your name and password are saved only if the connection is completed.
If the attempt to connect fails for any reason (such as a busy signal), the user
name and password revert to their original values.
