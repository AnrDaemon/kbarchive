TITLE   :FIX: Default Constructor Argument Can Not Use Namespace Scope
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbVC500bug kbVC600fixkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you give the default argument value for a class constructor a value that
references a namespace via the '::' operator, a C2065 error occurs as follows:

   [FileName](12) : error C2065: 'inside' : undeclared identifier

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use either the using directive to instruct the
compiler to consider the namespace as a possible place to find all symbols, or
the using declaration to tell the compiler to consider the namespace for the
specific symbol that is referenced by the default argument. Please see the
workarounds noted in the sample code below. Note that these workarounds make it
unnecessary to use the '::' operator to explicitly reference the namespace, but
it is also not necessary to remove it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code
-----------

      /* Compile Options Needed: None */ 
      namespace MyNameSpace {
      int inside = 34;
      };

      // Uncomment the following to workaround via the using declaration
      //using MyNameSpace::inside;
      // Uncomment the following to workaround via the using directive
      //using namespace MyNameSpace;

      class MyClass {
      public:
      MyClass(int iVal = MyNameSpace::inside);
      };

When you compile the code above, the following error message appears:

   [FileName](12) : error C2065: 'inside' : undeclared identifier

Additional query words: name space
