SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using Systems Management Server version 1.1, the error "Couldn't
create a new package" occurs when you attempt to create any package in the
Systems Management Server Administrator program.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs on computers running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 that
are also running Microsoft Systems Management Server 1.1. In addition, other
strange problems or errors may occur if Systems Management Server is running
under this configuration.

Because Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 was released after Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.1 had been released, Microsoft Systems Management Server 1.1
has not been tested to run under Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0. Running
Microsoft Systems Management Server 1.1 on computers running Microsoft Windows
NT Server 4.0 is not supported by Microsoft Technical Support.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do either of the following:

 - Upgrade Microsoft Systems Management Server to version 1.2.

-or-

 - Install and administer Microsoft Systems Management Server 1.1 on a computer
   running Microsoft Windows NT Server 3.51 with the latest Windows NT Server
   service pack.
