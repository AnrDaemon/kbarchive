PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the "*Bold* and _underline_ with real formatting" AutoFormat
option, any text preceded and followed by an underscore character has italic
applied instead of an underline.

NOTE: This problem does not occur in Microsoft Word 2000.

CAUSE
=====

The "*Bold* and _underline_ with real formatting" options on both the
"AutoFormat As You Type" and the AutoFormat tabs are incorrectly labeled. The
correct labeling should be "*Bold* and _italic_ with real formatting." To locate
the "AutoFormat As You Type" and AutoFormat tabs, click AutoCorrect on the Tools
menu.

The ToolTip is also incorrectly labeled for this feature. To locate the ToolTip,
on either of the "AutoFormat As You Type" or AutoFormat tabs, right-click the
"*Bold* and _underline_ with real formatting" option, and then click What's
This? on the shortcut menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "*Bold* and _underline_ with real formatting" AutoFormat feature uses two
character styles to do the formatting.

 - The *Bold* AutoFormat uses the Strong character style.

   -and-

 - The _Underline_ AutoFormat uses the Emphasis character style.

By default, the Strong style is "Default Paragraph Font + Bold," and the Emphasis
style is "Default Paragraph Font + Italic." Because these styles are
customizable, you can change the format of the Emphasis style from italic to
underline.

To change Emphasis style to underline:

1. On the Format menu, click Style.

2. In the List box, click All Styles.

3. In the Styles list, click Emphasis, and then click Modify.

4. In the Modify Style dialog box, click to select the Add To Template check
   box, click Format, and then click Font.

5. In the Font dialog box, click the Font tab.

6. In the Font Style list, click Regular, and in the Underline box, click
   Single.

7. Click OK twice, and then click Close to return to your document.

After following these steps, Microsoft Word automatically underlines your text
when you type text preceded and followed by an underscore character.

For more information about the "_underline_" AutoFormat feature, click the Office
Assistant, type "AutoFormat as you type," click Search, click to view "What
types of automatic changes does Word make," and then click to view "Learn about
AutoFormat changes Word makes."
