TITLE   :SMS: Despooler Does Not Preserve Existing Rights on Shares
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDespooler smsdespooler

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server Despooler service does not preserve share,
directory, or file permissions for a software distribution package. If the
administrator sets special permissions for a package on the destination
distribution server, and then distributes the package again, the Despooler
overwrites those permissions.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server Despooler is designed to support only Read or
Read/Write permissions. Every time it redistributes an application, it resets
the permissions to whatever the permissions are set for that package in the
Systems Management Server Administrator program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Systems Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base

MORE INFORMATION
================

The hotfix will not change any permissions if the share or directory already
exists. This allows administrators to set file and/or directory permissions
after the initial distribution of the package. Any additional redistribution of
that same package will not overwrite the permissions for that package.

The Forced Disconnect feature available in Systems Management Server version 1.2
should not be used because the share permissions will be restored to the default
permissions after the Forced Disconnect process has completed.
