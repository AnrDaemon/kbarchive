DOCUMENT:Q167050  10-AUG-2001  [winnt]
TITLE   :CPU Usage Limited to 100% on Multiprocessor Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.00 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.00 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

CPU usage at the process level appears to be truncated at 100 percent on
multiprocessor systems. When summing the thread data on multiprocessor computers
for a busy process, the sum will exceed 100 percent while the process metric
will only show 100 percent. As the collection interval increases, the sum of the
thread CPU usage does not equal the process metrics, even when the usage is less
than 100 percent of a single CPU.

CAUSE
=====

All percentages are capped at 100 percent.

RESOLUTION
==========

After applying the hotfix mentioned below, the following registry parameter will
allow the percentage to exceed 100 percent.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

Registry value:
Location: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\PerfMon
Parameter: CapPercentsAt100
Value: 1 default percent capped at 100.
Value: 0 New functionality, percent greater than 100.

STATUS
