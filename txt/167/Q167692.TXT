KEYWORDS:kbDlg kbMFC KbUIDesign kbVC500bug kbVS97sp1fix kbGrpDSMFCATL kbNoUpdate

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you display a property sheet using MFC (with DIALOG-type templates for the
property pages) on a Windows 95 machine with ComCtl32 version 4.00 and
MFC42X.dll version 4.21.7022, assertions occur on line 257 of DlgProp.cpp. An
assertion is generated for each page that is present on the property sheet.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is due to a bug in the code that checks whether the template is
DIALOGEX type.

RESOLUTION
==========

The assertion can be safely ignored.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 1.

For additional information about the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 1, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an Appwizard-generated application.

2. Add code to display a Property Sheet with pages on it.

3. Make sure the dialog templates for the pages are the DIALOG type.

4. Compile the program and run it on a computer that has the versions of the
   DLLs mentioned above in the SUMMARY section.

5. Invoke the code to display the property sheet.
