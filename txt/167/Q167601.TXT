TITLE   :Micrografx Designer 6.0 Cannot Print A0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a U.S. version of Windows NT Server 4.0 with a shared Hewlett-
Packard DesignJet 650c printer driver and a shared installation of Micrografx
Designer 6.0 (US), a German version of Windows NT Workstation 4.0 running
Designer may not be able to select the master page paper sizes A0 and A1 in the
printer settings. If you printout A0, the plotter may print six pages in A4 or
six Pages in letter format.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one or more of the following options:

 - Install the HP DesignJet 650c driver locally on the German version of Windows
   NT Workstation 4.0.

 - Give Everyone Full Control for the HP DesignJet 650c.

 - Install the U.S. version of Windows Workstation NT 4.0 on the client.
