TITLE   :Sound Schemes Do Not Migrate to Other Users
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Sound schemes installed under one account do not show up correctly for other
users in Control Panel Sound. If an administrator installs the multimedia sound
schemes in Control Panel Add/Remove Programs, the sound schemes will then only
be available to that user who installed them. This means that if a user needs to
install the multimedia components to get the sound schemes, he or she must have
administrator privileges.

CAUSE
=====

Currently the installation of the multimedia components are stored under the
user's registry key. This information is therefore not available to another
user.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only way to install the components for each user is to give the users
administrative rights while installing the multimedia components.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
