KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start a run-time copy of the Wrkgadm.exe file from a custom
shortcut on a computer that previously had Microsoft Office 97 Professional
Edition installed, you receive the following error message:

   Can't open registry database

CAUSE
=====

The registry entry for the shortcut that opened the Wrkgadm.exe file was removed
when the copy of Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition was uninstalled from
the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rerun Setup for the custom Setup program that created the shortcut to reregister
the entry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a custom application that includes a copy of the Wrkgadm.exe file that
   comes with Microsoft Access and a custom .mdw file that you have created.

   NOTE: Do not try to use the same copy of the Wrkgadm.exe file that is being
   used by Microsoft Access or the Setup Wizard will fail when it tries to use
   the file.

2. Create a shortcut that will open the Wrkgadm.exe file.

3. Run Setup to install your newly created run-time application on a computer
   that does not have Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition installed.

4. Start the Wrkgadm.exe file from the newly created shortcut.

5. Run Setup for Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition to install it.

6. After Setup is finished, run Setup again to completely remove Microsoft
   Office 97 Professional Edition.

7. Try to reopen the Wrkgadm.exe file from the shortcut. Note that you receive
   the error message mentioned in the "Symptoms" section.
