TITLE   :Error 0122 Starting Peer Web Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Microsoft Peer Web Server in Windows NT Workstation 4.0,
neither the World Wide Web Publishing service nor the FTP Server Service may
start automatically. In addition, if you attempt to start these services
manually, the following message may be displayed:

   Service manager on <COMPUTER NAME> could not start <SERVICE
   NAME>

   Error 0122 the data passed to the system call is too small

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by having TCP/IP protocols from multiple manufacturers
installed at the same time. Microsoft Peer Web Server functions only over the
Microsoft TCP/IP protocol.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following procedure should allow you to continue to use your own client for
access to your local network.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

Use Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) to change the following key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Winsock\ 
Parameters\Transports

Move TCP/IP to the top of the transports list. After you make this change,
Restart the computer.
