TITLE   :FIX: Deploy to a Unix Server Via FTP Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500bug kbVS97sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you deploy files through FTP to a UNIX server, the files are incorrectly
deployed to the parent directory and renamed to include the directory name. You
do not receive an error message warning you that the files were incorrectly
deployed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the way Visual SourceSafe 5.0 parses the UNIX FTP
deploy path. SourceSafe uses the '\' character when deploying, such that
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/test is interpreted as ftp.microsoft.com\test. Under
UNIX, the '\' character is a valid character for a filename, so UNIX
concatenates the path names.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 1.

For additional information about the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 1, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Set up a Visual SourceSafe project so that it is a Web-based project.

2. Select an FTP:// deploy path that goes to *any* UNIX server.

3. Deploy the project to the FTP:// location.

   Assuming that you have a project $/Source/Web/Default.html and that the deploy
   was to /pub/web, you will see the following under UNIX:

   pub/web/Web\Default.html

   UNIX interprets the slash character so that the filename is actually
   Web\Default.html rather than putting a file called Default.html under the Web
   directory.

   Note that Visual SourceSafe gives the "Deploying..." message on the files and
   everything appears to go as planned. You do not receive an error message.
