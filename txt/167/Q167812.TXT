SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) and Dynamic
Host Protocol Configuration (DHCP) Server Service have a new feature that
dynamically compacts their databases. This is in addition to the jetpack utility
which was also in previous versions of Windows NT and is not a replacement for
jetpack.

Windows NT 4.0 dynamic compacting decreases the frequency for which the jetpack
utility is needed. The jetpack program is still a feature of Windows 4.0. For
more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
