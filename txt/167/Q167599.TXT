======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! 98, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Plus!, the 8 x 16 TrueType font may no longer be
available in the Font box when you run an MS-DOS-based program.

CAUSE
=====

The font list built from the [TTFontDimenCache] section in the System.ini file
has been changed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the System.ini file in the
   Windows\System folder.

2. Add the following line to the [TTFontDimenCache] section of the file:

   0 15=8 16

3. Change the line numbering for the existing lines 0 15 and 0 16 to 0 16 and 0
   17.

4. Save and then close the System.ini file, and then restart Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing Microsoft Plus! installs the Lucida Console TrueType font, which
changes the font dimension settings, overwriting the default settings.
