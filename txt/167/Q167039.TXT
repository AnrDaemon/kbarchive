TITLE   :XWEB: Access Forbidden Error from Browser
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access a Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox from a browser
via the Web Connector (Active Server Pages), the following occurs:

1. The graphics on the logon page do not load.

2. If you enter a mailbox name and validation details, you receive the following
   error message:

   HTTP/1.0 403 Access Forbidden (Execute Access Denied - This
   Virtual Directory does not allow objects to be executed.)

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the default document set from Internet Server
Manager on IIS has been changed to something other than Default.htm.

NOTE: This message results if Logon.asp is named as the default document.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem can be resolved by renaming Default.htm in the IIS Home directory
to Default.xxx.

If you are unsure of the current setting for the Home directory, start Microsoft
Internet Server Manager and select properties for the WWW service. The
Directories tab shows a path for the Home directory.

To create a new default.htm in the Home directory, perform the following steps:

1. Open a new file and enter the following tags:

        <HTML>
        <HEAD>
        <META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0;URL=http://x_server_name/exchange">
        </HEAD>
        <BODY>
    

   For x_server_name, enter your Microsoft Exchange Server computer name as it
   appears in Control Panel Networks.

2. Save the new file.

3. Exit and restart the browser and type exchange_server_name as the URL. The
   logon should appear automatically.
