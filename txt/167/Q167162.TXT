TITLE   :Kids Plus: Custom Icons Appear in User Start Menu Profiles
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Plus! for Kids, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Microsoft Plus! for Kids Protect It!, programs (.exe, .bat,
and .com files) that have custom icons may appear on the first level of the
Start menu.

For example, you may specifically add (by using the More button) a program to the
Allowed Programs list for a family member. Because the program has a custom
icon, it did not previously appear on the Start menu.

After installing Protect It!, the .exe file icons are grouped together with the
other icons on the Start menu. This behavior occurs only with programs with
custom icons, not with those with a default MS-DOS icon.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Log in as the appropriate family member.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the Start button, and then click Open.

3. Double-click the Programs folder to open it.

4. Delete the icons that you do not want to appear on the Start menu.

Or, you can edit user Start menu profiles for each user in the
C:\Windows\Profiles\<username>\Start Menu folder.
