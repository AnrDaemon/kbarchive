TITLE   :Error Message: Setup Cannot Find Oemsetup.inf or Oemsetnt.inf
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbhw kbsetup kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to add a driver in Windows NT, you may receive the following
error message:

   Setup cannot find Oemsetup.inf or Oemsetnt.inf. Please type a new path to the
   Oemsetup.inf file.

This message may appear even though the Oemsetup.inf or Oemsetnt.inf file exists
in the location specified during the installation of the driver.

CAUSE
=====

The [PlatformsSupported] section of the .inf file may not list a bus type (EISA,
ISA, and so on) that exists on your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that the .inf file contains the correct information for your
computer's bus type in the [PlatformsSupported] section.

You must also make sure that you are installing the proper driver for your
computer's bus type. You cannot install a driver that was specifically written
for a bus type other than the type available on your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Either an Oemsetup.inf or an Oemsetnt.inf file is required to provide
installation instructions for adding a driver. The Oemsetup.inf or Oemsetnt.inf
file contains a [PlatformsSupported] section similar to the following sample
section:

   [PlatformsSupported]
   EISA
   "Jazz-Internal Bus"
   ISA
   PCI

3c619c Network Adapter Driver
-----------------------------

The driver for the 3c619c network card (3Com TokenLink III ISA) in the
Drvlib\Netcard\X86 folder on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM may generate this error
message. This driver is an ISA driver, but ISA is not listed in the
[PlatformsSupported] section of the .inf file.

To correct this problem, use the following steps:

1. Copy the files from the Drvlib\Netcard\X86\3C619C folder on the Windows NT
   4.0 CD-ROM to a folder on the hard disk.

2. Remove the Read-Only attribute from the Oemsetup.inf file by using the right
   mouse button to click the file, clicking Properties, and then clicking the
   Read-Only check box to clear it.

3. Edit the Oemsetup.inf file and add ISA to the [PlatformsSupported] section so
   that the section looks like:

      [PlatformsSupported]
       EISA
       "Jazz-Internal Bus"
       ISA

4. Save and close the Oemsetup.inf file, and then add the network adapter driver
   as you normally would. When you are prompted for the driver files, point to
   the files on the hard disk (that you copied in step 1).

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
