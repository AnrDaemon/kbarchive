SYMPTOMS

When you save a form that has been developed using Microsoft Exchange Forms
Designer that has an Entry field with initial text configured, the initial text
will not be retained when the form is opened and then saved. Subsequently, when
the form is opened, the entry field will be empty.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange Client
versions 4.0 and 5.0 for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post
new information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
