TITLE   :SMS: SNMP Trap Translator Fails After Applying WinNT 4.0 SP 2
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbSNMP smssnmp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server Trap Receiver is a service that makes SNMP trap
information available to Systems Management Server. The Systems Management
Server Trap Receiver can receive traps from any suitable SNMP source, including
the Event to Trap Translator. Traps generated by the Event to Trap Translator
will display a Windows NT event source name for the event that triggered the
trap.

After you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2, the Event to Trap Translator does
not function properly. Consequently, no traps are sent or written to the Systems
Management Server database.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 replaced two files: Snmp.exe and Snmpapi.dll.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, replace these files with those from the Windows NT
4.0 (no service pack) release.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
