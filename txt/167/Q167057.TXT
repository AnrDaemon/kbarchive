PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbtool kbui kbVBp500 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Visual Basic 5.0, remove the Visual Basic installation directory,
then reinstall Visual Basic to a new directory, the templates might become
unavailable. When the templates are not available, you will not be able to run
any Wizards or load any templates from the New Project dialog.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be caused by previous installations of Visual Basic 5.0 or
Visual Basic 5.0 Control Creation Edition (VB5CCE) that had templates in a now
non-existent directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following steps fix the problem:

1. With a project open, go to the Tools menu and select Options. The Options
   dialog appears.

2. In the Options dialog, go to the Environment tab and set the Templates
   Directory.

3. Enter the Templates directory where your template files reside. For the
   default templates, set the path to the Template sub-directory below your
   Visual Basic installation directory. For example:

      C:\PROGRAM FILES\DEVSTUDIO\VB\Template
