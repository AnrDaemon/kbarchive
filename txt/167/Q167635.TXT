TITLE   :XADM: Error Msg: <File> In Use By Another Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to upgrade to Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0, you may
receive the following error message:

   The file C:\EXCHSRVR\CONNECT\MSMCON\BIN\MTPERF.DLL
   is in use by another application.

You then have the options to Abort, Retry, or Ignore. If you click Ignore, you
may receive similar error messages, but for different files. Such files may be:

   C:\EXCHSRVR\CONNECT\MSMCON\BIN\XTNPERF.DLL
   C:\EXCHSRVR\BIN\MDBPERF.DLL
   C:\EXCHSRVR\BIN\MTAPERF.DLL
   C:\EXCHSRVR\BIN\GWPERF.DLL
   C:\EXCHSRVR\BIN\IMCPERF.DLL

CAUSE
=====

If any of the above files are locked open by other applications, such as virus
checking programs, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) programs, or
Performance Monitor (which may be running remotely against the Exchange Server
computer), then the upgrade process cannot replace these files.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, temporarily stop the program (usually by stopping
the corresponding service in the Windows NT Control Panel Services applet) that
may be locking the DLL open. Click the Retry option and continue with setup.
After setup completes successfully, restart any services you stopped in the
Windows NT Control Panel Services applet.
