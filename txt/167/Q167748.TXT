TITLE   :PRB: Variable Scope in for-statement Extends Beyond Loop
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbLangCPP kbVC500 kbVC600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you declare the same variable in two different for-statements, the following
error may appear:

   Test.cpp(4) : error C2374: 'i' : redefinition; multiple initialization

CAUSE
=====

The scope of a variable declared in the initialization part of a "for" loop is
given local scope, as if it had been declared immediately prior to the
for-statement.


RESOLUTION
==========

Compile with /Za, Disable Language Extensions. To select this option in
Developer Studio, select Project, Settings, and then click the C/C++ Tab. Change
the Category to Customize and select Disable Language Extensions.

If you cannot use the /Za option, you can work around the problem by #defining
the "for" keyword as follows:

   #define for if(0);else for

MORE INFORMATION
================

   /* Compile Options Needed to compile without error: /Za */ 

    /* test.cpp */ 
    void main()  {
   for (int i=0; i<10; i++)
      ;
   for (int i=0; i<15; i++)
      ;
    }
