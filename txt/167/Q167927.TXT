TITLE   :PRB: Building ATL Service Project Does Not Register the Service

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL), versions 2.0, 2.1, 3.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you build an ATL service, using the AppWizard, the COM objects are
registered, but the service does not appear in the Control Panel's list of
services.

CAUSE
=====

The Wizard creates a custom build rule for self-registration. The rule uses the
/RegServer switch instead of the /Service switch.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Wizard adds the following custom build command:

      "$(TargetPath)" /RegServer

Change the build command to:

      "$(TargetPath)" /Service

To change the command, bring up the Project Settings dialog box, click the Custom
Build tab, and edit the command in "Build command(s):". NOTE: If using Visual
Studio.NET, the Wizard adds the following "Post-Build Events" command line under
the "Buils Events" property page:

   "$(TargetPath)" /RegServer

Change the build command to:

   "$(TargetPath)" /Service

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because debugging local servers is easier than debugging services, most people
prefer the default to be /RegServer. Once you have completed testing the EXE as
a local server, you can either change the custom build step or run the EXE with
/Service.
