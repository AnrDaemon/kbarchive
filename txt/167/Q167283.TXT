TITLE   :WD97: Field Shading Split by Inline Object
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbfield word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you cross-reference text containing an inline object, the field shading for
the cross-reference field will appear as though there are two separately shaded
fields separated by an unshaded inline object. That is, the inline object breaks
up the field shading.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is a display problem only, and it does not affect the functionality of the
field.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Field shading is a display option that will shade the entire field when the
insertion point is anywhere in the field. To turn this setting on or off, follow
these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the View tab.

3. Change the Field Shading option to the desired setting: when selected,
   always, or never.
