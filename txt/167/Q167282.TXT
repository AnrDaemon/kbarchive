TITLE   :WD97: Equation Object Not Inserted at Insertion Point
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbole

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert an Equation Editor object, the object does not appear at the
place where the insertion point is located.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the Equation Editor object is inserted as a floating object. When an
object has the Float Over Text property, it is inserted into the drawing layer.
This feature allows you to precisely position the object by dragging it to the
desired location.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following methods to work around this behavior:

Method 1. Insert the object as an inline (non-floating) object
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Position the insertion point where you want to insert the object.

2. On the Insert menu, click Object.

3. Click to clear the Float Over Text check box.

4. In the Object Type list, click Microsoft Equation 3.0, and then click OK.

Method 2. Use the InsertEquation command
----------------------------------------

The InsertEquation command is a built-in Word command that inserts the Equation
Editor object as an inline object by default. To do this:

1. Position the insertion point where you want to insert the object.

2. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

3. In the Macros In drop-down list, click Word Commands.

4. In the Macro list, click InsertEquation, and then click Run.

   The Equation Editor appears. When you close the Equation Editor, the equation
   object will be inserted at the insertion point.

You can add the InsertEquation command to a menu, toolbar, or shortcut key. For
more information about how to do this, please see the following article in the

2. Click the Position tab.

3. Click to clear the Float Over Text check box.
