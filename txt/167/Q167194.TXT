TITLE   :XADM: Could Not Modify the DL Membership of Object
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to import recipients from a previously exported CSV file, the
following error may be logged in the event log for 1 or more recipients:

   Event ID: 284
   Source: MSExchangeDSImp
   Description:
   Could not modify the DL membership of object <<DN of recipient>> because
   the directory service reported the following error:  Changes cannot be
   written to this directory object. Try connecting to a Microsoft Exchange
   Server computer in the same site as this object.

CAUSE
=====

The above error occurs if you attempt to import a mailbox or custom recipient
that includes a "Member of" attribute that points to a distribution list from a
different site. The recipient gets created but import cannot add the recipient
to the membership list for the given DL. This is because an object that does not
belong to the directory on the local site cannot be directly written to.

This situation is common when you are using an exported list of users from a
particular site. When you do this, the "Members" attribute is also exported.
This attribute contains the distinguished name (DN) for any distribution list
the recipient is a member of, including distribution lists (DLs) from external
sites. As stated above, the local import function cannot modify attributes from
external sites, so the function fails.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Manually add the users to the DLs through the external site,

   -OR-

 - Create a new import file to add the users to the DL membership.
