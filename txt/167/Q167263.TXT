The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0a

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to perform some action in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer you receive
the following message:

   c:\src_server\src_share\data\<a-z>\<filename> is already open

where filename is a file in the Visual SourceSafe database.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if another user or process has the file locked, or if the
network has not released its lock on the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

The file that the error message is referring to is one of the many files stored
in your Visual SourceSafe database, specifically in the DATA subdirectory.
Visual SourceSafe uses its own naming scheme to track these files and their
history of changes.

You can get this message if another user has this file locked. One way to fix it
is:

1. Log out from Visual SourceSafe.

2. On the Visual SourceSafe command line, type the following:

   ss status $/project/filename

This should close the file handle and fix the problem.

This error may also be caused by running memory resident anti-virus programs. If
you are running an anti-virus program, close it and then retry the SourceSafe
operation.

NOTE: To get the actual filename from the Visual SourceSafe filename, use the
PHYSICAL command.

For additional information about the PHYSICAL command, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q131447 Use PHYSICAL Command to Find SourceSafe Database File

If the above method does not correct the problem you may have to use the server
utilities for your server operating system to manually break the users
connection to close the file handle.

If problems like this persist you may need to enable SourceSafe locking.

For additional information on file locking, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q124525 INFO: How SourceSafe Locks Files in the DATA Directory

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
