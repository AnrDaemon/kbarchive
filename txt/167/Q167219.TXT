PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using the versioning feature in Word 97 with a protected document
containing form fields, Word 97 may hang when you open an earlier version of the
document.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Versioning allows you to maintain a working history of a document. With this
feature, you can see exactly who did what to a document and when. You can also
enter descriptive text about the changes made in each version. All the
versioning information is stored within the document, so you don't need to
maintain and track multiple copies of the document
