SYMPTOMS
========

When you open an HTML document in Word 97, if the document contains a picture
with alternate text, the HTML tag for the alternate text may not be displayed
correctly.

For example, the following HTML tag

   <IMG SRC="jack.gif" ALT= "<Hi>" WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=75>

will display the graphic at its default size and the words "WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=75"
will be displayed after the graphic.

The expected behavior of this tag is that the picture is displayed with a size of
75 x 7, and the alternate text of "<Hi>" should be displayed if the
browser has been customized to hide graphics.

NOTE: The Graphic and alternate text may appear fine in your browser.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the alternate text is enclosed in angle brackets or
greater than (>) or less than (<) symbols.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the following syntax to place the enclose the alternate text in angle
brackets:

   <IMG SRC="jack.gif" ALT= "&lt;Hi&gt;" WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=75>

MORE INFORMATION
================

Certain characters have special meaning and are considered reserved in HTML
documents. The following table lists each of the supported characters specified
in the numeric and special graphic entity set, along with its name, syntax, and
description.

This list is derived from ISO Standard 8879;1986/ENTITIES Numeric and Special
Graphic//EN; however, HTML does not provide support for the entire entity set.
Only the entities listed are supported.

     Glyph    Name    Syntax    Description
   --------------------------------------

   <        lt      <      Less than sign
   >        gt      >      Greater than sign
   &        amp     &     Ampersand
   "        quot    &quot     Double quote sign;

NOTE: The entity names are used in HTML, are always prefixed by ampersand
(&), and are always followed by a semicolon (;). They represent particular
graphic characters that have special meanings in places in the mark-up language,
or may not be part of the character set available to you.
