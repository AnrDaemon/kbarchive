TITLE   :FIX: ATL Service EXE Doesn't Build in Release Build
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVC500bug kbVC600fix

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to build a release mode of an ATL service EXE created with ATL COM
AppWizard, you get the following the error message:

   "error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _main"

CAUSE
=====

Builds in release mode automatically include the preprocessor directive
_ATL_MIN_CRT, while the default ATL service code generated by the wizard
requires the CRT library.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove _ATL_MIN_CRT from the list the preprocessor defines to allow CRT startup
code to be included.

1. From the Project menu, click Settings.

2. In the Settings For drop-down list, select Multiple Configurations.

3. In the Select project configuration(s) to modify dialog box that displays,
   select the check boxes for all release versions, and then click OK.

4. Click the C/C++ tab in the Project Settings dialog box, and then choose the
   General category.

5. Remove _ATL_MIN_CRT from the Preprocessor definitions edit box.

NOTE: You can also remove calls to the CRT functions within the generated
CServiceModule::LogEvent function.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Server EXE project using ATL COM Appwizard.

2. Build one of the release builds.

The error listed in the SYMPTOMS section should occur.
