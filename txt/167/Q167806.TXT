======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There are several advanced options and preferences that can be configured in the
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) Manager that affect the way the WINS server
performs and displays data.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In WINS Manager, on the Server menu, click Configuration, and then click
Advanced to access the following settings:

Logging Enabled - when enabled, WINS will log all changes to the Jet.log file in
the path specified by the following registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Wins\ 
Parameters\LogFilePath

By default, this is set to %SystemRoot%\System32\WINS.

Log Detailed Events - when enabled, WINS event log entries will have detailed
information, but may affect performance since it is very resource intensive.

Replicate Only With Partners - this option specifies that the WINS server should
only replicate with Push or Pull partners. Without this option selected, an
administrator can request replication with a WINS server that is not a Push or
Pull partner.

Backup On Termination - this option automatically performs a backup of the WINS
database when the WINS Service is stopped, but not when the system is shut
down.

Migrate On/Off - when enabled, static records are treated as dynamic when they
conflict with a new registration or replication. This means that if the static
entry is no longer valid, the new record will overwrite it. Select this option
if you are upgrading non-WINS clients to become WINS clients.

Starting Version Count - set this value to a number higher than the version
number that appears for replication of this WINS server's records on its remote
partners, if this server has to restart. This will force the remote partners to
replicate the new records.

Database Backup Path - specifies the location for the backup of the WINS
database. If you specify a path, WINS automatically performs a full backup of
its database to the Wins_bak folder within this folder every 24 hours. Do not
specify a network drive. WINS uses this location to automatically restore the
database in the event that the database is found to be corrupted when WINS is
started.

NOTE: The Database Backup Path option will not automatically back up your WINS
database every 24 hours until the WINS service has been stopped and started.

Click Options and select Preferences to access the following settings:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Address Display - this setting specifies how the mappings will be displayed in
the database window.

Server Statistics - this setting specifies how often to update the server
statistics.

Computer Names - When selected, the mappings in the database window will display
the 16th character (1B, 1C, 1E, etc) of each record.

Validate Cache Of Known WINS Servers At Startup Time - this setting causes WINS
to query the list of servers to find available servers when the service starts.

Confirm Deletion of Static Mappings And Cached WINS Servers - this setting
specifies whether to generate a warning message when deleting a static mapping
or a cached WINS server.

New Pull Partner Default Configuration - these settings specify the default
settings for new Pull partners.

New Push Partner Default Configuration - these settings specify the default
settings for new Push partners. The default Update Count is 20.
