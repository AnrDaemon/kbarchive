-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you click Next, the Add Printer Wizard does not respond. The problem
occurs with any user, even Administrator, but works properly after the server is
restarted or the Spooler service is stopped and then restarted.

CAUSE
=====

A user in the Print Operator group or Power User group has attempted to create a
printer using an LPR port.

Printer Operators and Power Users can create printers but do not have sufficient
access to the registry to create new printer ports.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
