TITLE   :STOP 0x7A or System Lockup in NTBACKUP with MINIQIC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After selecting Hardware Setup in NTBACKUP, and pressing the OK button when the
MINIQIC device is shown, the SCSI bus may stop responding. The system will send
a SCSI RESET numerous times before it gives up. If the boot device happens to be
on the same SCSI bus, the system will blue screen with the following error
message:

   STOP 0x0000007A KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR

This problem seems to occur with every MINIQIC device. This only happens when a
MINIQIC device is attached to a SCSI host adapter controlled by Aic78xx.sys.


CAUSE
=====

A bit was not getting reset during a PCI Master Abort condition, causing all
SCSIPORT requests to not make it to the SCSI bus.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
