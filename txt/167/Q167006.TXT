TITLE   :INFO: Removing Recycle Bin Option During Unattended Setup

KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT 4.0 Recycle Bin is installed and configured by default during
setup. There is no option to remove the Recycle Bin with the Unattend.txt
script. The following information shows how to remove the Recycle Bin from the
desktop and how to disable the ability to use the Recycle Bin on any drive.
Evaluate this option carefully. Disabling the Recycle Bin disables all functions
of restoring files that would normally be placed in the Recycle Bin. It is not
possible to remove only the icon from the desktop and leave the Recycle Bin
functions in tact.

Depending on the security requirements of your environment, this option may be
desirable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By using the INF format supported by Windows NT 4.0, you can remove the Name
Space for the Recycle Bin during Windows NT installation/deployment. You can
copy and save the following INF file to save time and to prevent syntax errors.

1. Copy the information starting with the line first line [Version] to the last
   line [UpdateInis].

      [Version]
      Signature = "$Windows NT$"

      [DefaultInstall]
      AddReg = AddReg
      DelReg = DelReg
      UpdateInis = UpdateInis

      [AddReg]
      [DelReg]

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer
         \Desktop\NameSpace\ 
      {645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}"
      [UpdateInis]

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

2. Save the information to a file called Remcycl.inf.

To take advantage of the INF file during the Windows NT automated installation
process, configure the following information:

1. Configure an Unattend.txt file that is configured to install Windows NT 4.0.

2. Add the option OEMPreInstall = Yes to the [UNATTENDED] section in the answer
   file.

3. Create an I386 folder on a server. Copy the files from the I386 folder of the
   Windows NT 4.0 compact disc to the I386 folder on the server.

4. Create a folder called $OEM$ in the I386 folder on the server.

5. Copy the Remcycl.inf file to the $OEM$.

6. Using a text editor, create or modify the Cmdlines.txt file, and then save it
   to the $OEM$.

To save time, copy the following two lines of information to create the required
Cmdlines.txt:

      [Commands]
      "rundll32 setupapi,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 128 .\REMCYCL.INF"

NOTE: If you have an existing Cmdlines.txt file, do not copy the [Commands] line
because an existing Cmdlines.txt file has this line.

You can remove the Recycle Bin using the preceding method because of the new INF
file format that Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 95 use. Consult the Windows NT 4.0
DDK and the Windows NT 4.0 SDK for detailed information on the new INF format
and options.
