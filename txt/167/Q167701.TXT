SUMMARY
=======

By default, the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 "Deployment Guide" provides the option
to only install the Network Monitor Agent for Microsoft Windows NT Server
version 4.0 and Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0. Windows NT Server
provides the Network Monitoring software. In order to install the agent and the
monitoring software, a different option name is used in the Unattended answer
file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the Network Monitor Agent and Tools on Windows NT Server 4.0, only
the NETMONTOOLS is used instead of NETMON in the service section of the
Unattended answer file.

The following example shows how to install the Network Monitor Agent for Windows
NT Server and Workstation.

[NETWORK]
InstallServices = SelectedServices

[SelectedServices]
NETMON = NETMONParams

[NETMONParams]

The following example shows how to install the Network Monitor Agent and tools on
Windows NT 4.0 Server only.

[NETWORK]
InstallServices = SelectedServices

[SelectedServices]
NETMONTOOLS = NETMONParams

[NETMONParams]

On Windows NT Server 4.0 the option name NETMONTOOLS is used instead of NETMON to
install the agent and the tools.

Note that in both examples the section [NETMONParams] must be included even
though there are no additional parameters required. If the section is missing
the component will not be installed.

For additional information on Windows NT 4.0 deployment/unattended installation,
please consult the Microsoft Knowledge Base at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/kb and download the Windows NT 4.0 Deployment Guide
   from http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation.

NOTE: The Deployment Guide is valid for both Windows NT Workstation and Windows
NT Server.
