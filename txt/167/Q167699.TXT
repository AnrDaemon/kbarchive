TITLE   :Underlining of Hyperlinks Unavailable in Windows Messaging
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a hyperlink (such as http://www.microsoft.com) to a mail message,
the link is not underlined and you cannot click the link to go to the site that
is referenced.

CAUSE
=====

Windows Messaging does not include the ability to automatically underline
hyperlinks. Windows Messaging is a basic mail client included with Windows 95
and Windows NT 4.0 without the full feature set available in other products.

RESOLUTION
==========

Update Windows Messaging with Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Exchange, or use
Microsoft Outlook Express, for the automatic underlining of links and the
ability to click a link to go to the site.
