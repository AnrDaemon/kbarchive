TITLE   :Mapping Operation Attempted on Non-NetWare Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0

KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

With Client or Gateway Service for Novell NetWare configured to run a NetWare
login script, the following error may occur when the login script attempts to
map a drive letter to a NetWare volume:

   The following drive mapping operation was attempted on a non-NetWare network
   drive. "X:=SERVER/VOL:\DIR"

The exact syntax of the drive mapping in the error message will depend on the
syntax of the actual MAP command in the login script.

CAUSE
=====

This message will occur if drive X: in the earlier example is already redirected
to another network resource. If you have previously created a persistent
connection to a non-NetWare server on drive X:, the persistent connection will
be established before the NetWare login script is run, resulting in the error
message above.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, change the drive letter that the Map command refers to
in the NetWare login script, or remove the Windows NT persistent server
connection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the persistent connection on drive X: is to a NetWare server, you will
receive the following error during processing of the NetWare login script:

   Attempt to map drive to invalid path in map command "X:=SERVER/VOL:\DIR".

The exact syntax of the drive mapping in the error message will also depend on
the syntax of the actual Map command in the login script.
