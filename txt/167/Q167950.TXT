OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbVBp500 kbVS97sp1fix kbVS97sp2fix kbGrpDSVB kbvbp500sp1fix kbvbp500sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Studio 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Office97 is already installed, the MSJET35.CAB file fails to install.

CAUSE
=====

The version of VBAJET32.DLL installed by Office97 does not register as a Win32
DLL. Internet Explorer looks for this property in DLLs that are to be
overwritten and will fail to download if this property is not found.

RESOLUTION
==========

The MSJET35.CAB file and the setup toolkit have been updated. DAO will install
correctly even if the Office97 version of VBAJET32.DLL is on the client system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 1.

For additional information about the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 1, please see
