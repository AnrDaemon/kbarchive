Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Copy the following lines of code into a .prg file and run it:

         PUBLIC x
         x = CREATEOBJECT( 'form1' )
         x.Show

         **************************************************
         *-- Form:         form1 (h:\vfp5\misc\cyrus_edt2.scx)
         *-- ParentClass:  form
         *-- BaseClass:    form
         *
         DEFINE CLASS form1 AS Form
           Top = 0
           Left = 0
           DoCreate = .T.
           Caption = "Form1"
           Name = "Form1"

           ADD OBJECT edit1 AS EditBox WITH ;
                 Height = 217, ;
                 Left = 12, ;
                 Top = 12, ;
                 Width = 121, ;
                 Name = "Edit1"

           PROCEDURE Click
                 KEYBOARD REPLICATE( "a{enter}", 60 ) PLAIN
                 KEYBOARD REPLICATE( "a{enter}", 60 ) PLAIN
                 KEYBOARD REPLICATE( "a{enter}", 60 ) PLAIN
                 KEYBOARD REPLICATE( "a{enter}", 60 ) PLAIN
           ENDPROC

         ENDDEFINE
         *
         *-- EndDefine: form1
         **************************************************

2. Click anywhere on the form outside of the Edit box region. NOTE: this
   populates the edit region with multiple lines of the letter "a."

3. Click into any active window outside of the form, such as the Command window.
   NOTE: The error is generated.
