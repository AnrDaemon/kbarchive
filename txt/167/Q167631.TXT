TITLE   :SMS: Windows 95 Service Pack 1 Contains Incorrect PDF Format
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbinterop kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) numbers listed in the Windows 95 Service Pack
1 package definition file (PDF) for the Ole32.dll and Shell32.dll files are:

   Ole32.dll      =  512 2048 23537
   Shell32.dll    =  256 1024 53870

When you import the PDF to create a package, the CRC numbers listed in the
package are different:

   Ole32.dll      =  512 527152781 257776
   Shell32.dll    =  256 527152781 257776

They are different because the PDF format is wrong. It needs commas, as in the
following example:

   Ole32.dll      =  512,2048,23537
   Shell32.dll    =  256,1024,53870


MORE INFORMATION
----------------

Because of this problem with the PDF, software inventory will be unable to
determine whether Windows 95 is installed on your clients until you make the
necessary changes to the CRC data in the PDF file itself.
