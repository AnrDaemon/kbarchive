TITLE   :Cannot Open Devices or Modem Tool in Control Panel
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click the Devices icon in Control Panel, you may receive the
following error message:

   Configuration Manager: This routine is not implemented in this version of the
   operating system.

Also, when you double-click the Modem icon in Control Panel, Modems Properties
may not open.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if the following Windows NT files have been replaced by
Microsoft Windows 95 versions of the same files:

   %systemroot%\system32\Cfgmgr32.dll
   %systemroot%\system32\Setupapi.dll

These files may have been replaced by the installation of a program. If you
receive the error message listed above, check these files to make sure they are
the Windows NT versions.

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete the existing files, and replace them with files from the Windows NT
CD-ROM.

NOTE: Both files on the Windows NT CD-ROM are compressed and must be expanded.
You can expand the files by typing the following commands at a command prompt
(assuming that the CD-ROM drive is drive D, you are using the Intel platform,
and the Windows NT installation folder is C:\Winnt):

   expand d:\i386\cfgmgr32.dl_ c:\winnt\system32\cfgmgr32.dll
   expand d:\i386\setupapi.dl_ c:\winnt\system32\setupapi.dll
