TITLE   :PRB: Cmdlines.txt Does Not Recognize Parameters Surrounded by Qu
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During an unattended setup, some entries in the Cmdlines.txt file do not
execute.

CAUSE
=====

The entries in Cmdlines.txt that are not executing may contain entries that
contain parameters between quotation marks, as in the following example:

      Cmdlines.txt
         [Commands]
         ".\at 04:00 /interactive cmd.exe /c "c:\batch\runme.bat"

Cmdlines.txt treats the first quotation mark in the parameter as the end of the
command line.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, create a batch file containing the same command line
with quotation marks, and run that batch file from the Cmdlines.txt text file.
For the previous example, the resolution would be:

      CMDLINES.TXT
         [Commands]
         ".\mybatch.bat"

      Mybatch.bat
         AT 04:00 /interactive cmd.exe /c "c:\batch\runme.bat"

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Unattend.txt setup script must include "OEMPreinstall=Yes in the
[Unattended] section, to enable the Cmdlines.txt file. This file must also
reside in the $OEM$ directory of your Windows NT distribution share.

For additional information about unattended installations, please see the
following article at the Microsoft Web site:
