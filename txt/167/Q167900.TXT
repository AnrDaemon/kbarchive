SYMPTOMS
========

When you use System Policy Editor and attempt to save a policy file on a
computer running Windows NT, you may receive the following error message:

   An error occurred writing the registry. The file cannot be saved.

CAUSE
=====

To save a policy file using System Policy Editor on a computer running Windows
NT, you must be a member of the administrators group. The reason for this
limitation is that, even when you are only saving a .pol file to the local
system, you need to access registry settings to complete the operation.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The specified policy file will be saved to the system. The size of the file will
be 0 KB. If you attempt to open this file you receive an error message similar
to the following:

   Unable to open c:\ntconfig.pol:
   A required privilege is not held by the client.

When you try the same procedure using an administrator-equivalent account you
will receive an error message similar to the following:

   Unable to open c:\ntconfig.pol:
   The configuration registry database is corrupt.

Additional query words: system policy editor save as rights poledit
