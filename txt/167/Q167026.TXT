TITLE   :Windows NT 4.0 DNS Server Stops Responding to Queries
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT 4.0 Domain Name Service (DNS) server may stop responding to queries,
or you may notice DNS taking up large amounts of memory when multiple IP
addresses are bound to the network adapter.

CAUSE
=====

DNS server must open a socket on every address that will receive DNS queries.
This can take up a lot of memory when multiple IP addresses or multiple network
adapters are used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 uses large buffers by default to avoid dropping packets when
under high load. These buffer sizes have been reduced in Service Pack 3 when
binding to more than three IP addresses.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
