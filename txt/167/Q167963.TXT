SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install a program that is designed to run from a
network server using a specific mapped drive letter on a local drive instead of
a network server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the program locally, use one of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

NOTE: This method uses DriveSpace and does not work on drives using the FAT32
file system. For additional information, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q150579 DriveSpace Is Not Supported with FAT32 Drives

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
   System Tools, and then click DriveSpace.

2. On Advanced menu, click Create Empty.

3. In the Create New Compressed Drive dialog box, assign the drive letter
   required by the program in the Create A New Drive Named box.

4. Click Start.

5. Click Close.

6. Install the program to the new compressed drive.

Method 2
--------

Use the SUBST command to associate the required drive letter with the program's
installation folder. For example, use

   subst <drive>: <C:\dir>

where <drive> is the drive the program requires to be mapped to, and
<C:\dir> is the folder in which the program resides.

NOTE: You should install Windows 95 Service Pack 1 if you are using the SUBST
command and you have the retail release of Windows 95. If you have an OEM
release of Windows 95, this update may already be included in your version of
Windows 95. For information about obtaining Service Pack 1, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q142794 Availability of Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1

For additional information about issues that can occur when you use the SUBST
command, see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
