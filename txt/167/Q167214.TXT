TITLE   :WD97: Heading Styles Missing From Style List
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhtml word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a Word 97 document that contains the Heading 4 through Heading 9
heading styles and you save the document as HyperText Markup Language (HTML),
the Style list on the Formatting toolbar will no longer contain Heading 4
through Heading 9 heading styles.

Note that after you convert a Word 97 document to HTML, the style formatting is
converted to HTML code.

CAUSE
=====

When you convert a Word 97 document to HTML format, Word attaches the Html.dot
template to the document. The Heading 4 through Heading 9 heading styles are not
stored in the Html.dot template so they do not appear in the Style list on the
Formatting toolbar.

WORKAROUND
==========

To access all of the styles, use either of the following methods:

 - Press SHIFT and click the Style arrow.

   -or-

 - On the Format menu, click Style. In the List box, click All Styles.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
