SYMPTOMS
========

When you enter design mode to view the code for a control in a new document
based on a template that contains the embedded control (for example a Command
button), the Visual Basic for Applications code appears to be missing.

CAUSE
=====

In Word 97, documents and templates have their own Visual Basic for Applications
projects: a document project and a template project.

When you create a new document based on a template that contains a control, you
create a new "document" project. Because the control has been embedded in the
template, the code you create for the control event resides within the template
project. When you attempt to view the code for a control after you create a new
document based on a template, you will only see the procedures for the document
project. Since the code for the control is stored in the template project, you
do not see the Visual Basic for Applications control code as expected.

WORKAROUND
==========

To view the code for the control, use the following steps:

1. On the View menu, point to Toolbars, and then click Control Toolbox.

2. Click the Design Mode button on the Control Toolbox toolbar.

3. Select the control.

4. Click the View Code button on the Control Toolbox toolbar.

5. Switch to the Visual Basic Editor.

6. On the View menu, click Project Explorer.

7. In the Project Explorer, open the template project.

8. Open the Microsoft Word Objects\ThisDocument module within the template
   project.

9. Select the ThisDocument module.

10. On the View menu, click Code.

   You can now see the code for the embedded control.
