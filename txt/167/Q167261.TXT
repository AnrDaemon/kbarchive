SUMMARY
=======

The "Replacing a Primary Domain Controller," paragraph on page 4, Chapter 1 of
the Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Guide is incorrect.

It states that, if the primary domain controller (PDC) is not available, you can
install a new PDC and the PDC will create a new security identifier (SID) for
the existing domain. This is partially correct. The new PDC will be created as a
new domain, but the existing backup domain controllers (BDC) will not be able to
synchronize with the new PDC.

Promoting an existing BDC is the only working and supported procedure for
replacing a PDC.
