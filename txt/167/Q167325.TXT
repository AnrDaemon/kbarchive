TITLE   :FIX: Env Vars Not Used in Exported Makefile Dependencies
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:5.0 6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbide kbVC kbVC500bug kbVC600fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Environment variables used in the Persist As field are not written to the
makefile for dependencies.

RESOLUTION
==========

This bug should only be a problem if the makefile is exported on one computer
and used on a different computer with a different directory structure for the
project. Either use the same directory structure for your project on multiple
computers, or use Developer Studio to export the makefile for the project to the
computer that you want to use the makefile on.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In FileView, select a file and choose Properties from the View menu. This
displays the Properties page for the selected file. On the Properties page is
the "Persist As" field, which lets you use an environment variable to set the
location of the selected file. When the environment variable is expanded and
concatenated with the rest of the path in the Persist As field to form the full
path to the selected file, that full path must be a valid path to the selected
file.

If this file is a dependency of another file (such as a header file), when a
makefile for the project is exported, either the fully qualified path or a
relative path to the files that are dependencies is written to the makefile.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Go to a command prompt and set a variable MYAPP=D:\Projects\MyApp.

2. From this command prompt, start Msdev.exe.

3. Create a default MFC AppWizard .exe named MyApp in D:\Projects\MyApp.

4. In FileView, select MyApp.h and choose Properties from the View menu.

5. In the Persist As field, type: $(MYAPP)\MyApp.h

6. Close the property page for MyApp.h.

7. From the File menu, choose Save All.

8. From the Project menu, choose Export Makefile.

9. Open MyApp.mak and search for MyApp.h. Notice that the path doesn't include
   $(MYAPP).
