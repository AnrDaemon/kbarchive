TITLE   :FIX: Analyze May Hang When Running on Large Databases
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500bug kbVS97sp1fix kbVS97sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Analyze may appear to hang on the third pass. In most cases, it continues to run
but it may take hours or even days to finish. The problem is most prevalent (but
not limited to) when you are working with complex, gigabyte-size databases.

CAUSE
=====

In the first and second passes, Analyze reads through all the files in the
database. During the third pass, it tries again to navigate from the root
project to every single leaf of every branch. If it finds a problem with missing
projects or subprojects, Analyze tries to rebuild the missing information by
looking at each file in the entire database again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 1.

For additional information about the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 1, please see
