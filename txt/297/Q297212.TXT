KEYWORDS:kbExchange550preSP5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you permanently disconnect sites, you may be unable to gain access to or
delete unwanted public folders. Messages in the Application event log may report
that the DS/IS consistency adjuster created directory objects for the folders;
however, no directory objects are created and the folders remain inaccessible.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the site name of the site in which the DS/IS
consistency adjuster is run and the site name of the remote site that was
disconnected are similar (for example, SITE1 and SITE12).

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.
