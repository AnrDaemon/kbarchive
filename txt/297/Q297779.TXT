In VFP version 6.0 running on Microsoft Windows 2000:

   VFP6.exe has generated an error and will be closed by Windows. You need to
   restart the program. An error log is being generated.

In VFP version 6.0 running on Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me):

   Vfp6 has caused an error in VFP6.exe.
   Vfp6 will now close.

In VFP verion 5.0 running on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. To set up a test database and open the View Designer, run the following code
   in a program file or the command window:

   SET SAFETY OFF
   CLOSE DATA ALL

   lcDir = SET("DEFAULT") + CURDIR()

   CREATE DATABASE company
   CREATE TABLE employees (iEmpID I, cName c(80))
   CLOSE DATABASES ALL

   OPEN DATABASE company SHARED
   CREATE CONNECTION cnCompany CONNSTRING "DSN=Visual FoxPro Database;" + ;
       "UID=;PWD=;SourceDB=" + lcDir + "Company.DBC;SourceType=DBC;" + ;
       "Exclusive=No;BackgroundFetch=No;Collate=Machine;DBQ="
   CREATE VIEW r_Employees REMOTE CONNECTION cnCompany SHARED AS ;
   	SELECT * FROM employees

   _CLIPTEXT = "MODIFY VIEW r_Employees"
   KEYBOARD "{ctrl+f2}{ctrl+end}{ctrl+v}{enter}"

2. After the View Designer appears, type the following in the command window:

   SQLDISCONNECT(0)

This closes all open connections.

3. Right-click the View Designer and click Run Query. In the ODBC dialog box,
   click Cancel.

4. VFP displays the following error message:

   Connectivity error: Unable to retrieve specific error information. Driver is
   probably out of resources

Click OK.

5. Minimize and then maximize VFP.

6. Right-click the View Designer again and click Run Query. In the Fetch is in
   progress dialog box, click OK.
