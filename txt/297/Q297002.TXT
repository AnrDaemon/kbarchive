TITLE   :"The RPC Server Is Unavailable" Err Msg and Events 5718 and 3013
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to synchronize a backup domain controller (BDC) with the primary
domain controller (PDC) of a domain, the synchronization of the Security
Accounts Manager (SAM) database may not succeed. You may receive the following
error message on the BDC:

   The RPC server is unavailable

The System Event Log of the BDC may display the following information:

   Event ID: 5718
   Event Type: Error
   Event Source: Netlogon
   Description: The full synchronization replication of the name database from
   the primary domain controller <computername> failed with the following
   error: <text>

   Event ID: 3013
   Event Type: Error
   Event Source: Rdr
   Description: The redirector has timed out a request to <computername>.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the communication link between the BDC and the PDC
does not support large packet sizes, for example, packets that are more than
1024 bytes in size.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the behavior, adjust the communication link to support larger packet
sizes. This setting is usually adjusted on a router.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To see whether there is a communication problem between the BDC and the PDC, use
packets of increasing sizes and try to ping the PDC by IP address. You can use
the ping command with the -l option. Also, you can use the Tracert.exe utility
to determine where the packets are being dropped.
