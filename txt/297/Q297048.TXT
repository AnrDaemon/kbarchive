======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a computer, various other user-mode programs may continue to
load, including Systems Management Server (SMS). If you start a program before
SMS finishes loading (particularly Wuser32.exe and Smsapm32.exe), the program
that you started loses the focus in preference to the SMS program because the
SMS program is loaded after your program.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur after you log on if various programs (including SMS 2.0)
continue to load components while you begin work. Programs that load as you log
on can be specified in various locations, including the System.ini or Win.ini
files, or in the registry under the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/MICROSOFT/WINDOWS/CURRENTVERSION/RUN

SMS components load from the registry at this location.

This behavior occurs on Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft
Windows 98 Second Edition, and Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me)
clients. This behavior does not occur on a Microsoft Windows NT or Microsoft
Windows 2000 client because SMS programs are loaded as services.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, click the program window of the program that you
want to use to return the focus to that program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
