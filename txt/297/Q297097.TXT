TITLE   :XCCC: Playback for Multimedia Control on Swedish Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.01,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2, 3 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.01 for Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a computer that is running the Swedish-language version of
Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 or Microsoft Windows NT Workstation
version 4.0 for the first time and you download the multimedia control in either
Outlook Web Access (OWA) or Outlook 2000 and then restart the computer, you may
not be able to play your recordings correctly.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, play a video clip in the media player on the
computer (often Microsoft Windows Media Player); after you do so, the multimedia
control can play your recordings correctly. You only have to play a video clip
to play a recording. You can record and send a video clip without playing a
video clip first.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The media player codec needs to be installed on the computer that is running the
Swedish-language version of Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation for the
multimedia control to be able to play the video clip.
