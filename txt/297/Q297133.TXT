======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the UPPER function on strings that include high-ASCII characters,
you may see unexpected changes.

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro makes characters uppercase that are considered alphabetic by the
ISALPHA function. ISALPHA is not font-dependent, so fonts that include symbol
characters appear to behave incorrectly when strings that are displayed in them
are run through the UPPER function.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you must use symbol characters in your uppercase strings, test each character
and make it uppercase individually.

   lcOldFontName = _SCREEN.FontName
   lnOldFontSize = _SCREEN.FontSize
   _SCREEN.FontName = "FoxFont"
   _SCREEN.FontSize = 9

   *!* 241 is the plus/minus character.
   lcMixedString = "Value is 500" + CHR(241) + "0.05%"
   ? lcMixedString
   ? UPPER(lcMixedString)  && Displays box character

   lcUpperString = ""
   FOR i = 1 TO LEN(lcMixedString)
      lcCurrChar = SUBSTR(lcMixedString, i, 1)
      IF BETWEEN(lcCurrChar, "a", "z")
         lcCurrChar = UPPER(lcCurrChar)
      ENDif
      
      lcUpperString = lcUpperString + lcCurrChar
   ENDfor

   ? lcUpperString

   _SCREEN.FontName = lcOldFontName
   _SCREEN.FontSize = lnOldFontSize

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To see all characters that are affected by UPPER, run the following code:

   _SCREEN.FontName = "Lucida Sans Unicode"
   CLEAR

   FOR i = 1 TO 255
      IF CHR(i) != UPPER(CHR(i))
         ? i, CHR(i), UPPER(CHR(i))
      ENDif
   ENDfor

NOTE: Change the FontName property to "FoxFont" to see the problem that is
described in the "Symptoms" section.
