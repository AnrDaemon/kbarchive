TITLE   :Incorrect Server Variables If You Use Client Certificate Mapping
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Internet Information Server (IIS) 5.0 and Active Directory client
certificate mapping, the authenticated user is displayed in the server variables
list as <SERVERNAME>\<loggedonuser> instead of
<DOMAINNAME>\<loggedonuser>.

You can use the following Active Server Pages (ASP) page to generate the related
server variables output:

   <%
   response.write request.servervariables ("AUTH_USER") & "<BR>"
   response.write request.servervariables ("LOGON_USER") & "<BR>"
   response.write request.servervariables ("REMOTE_USER") & "<BR>"
   response.write "HELLO" & "<BR>"
   %>
