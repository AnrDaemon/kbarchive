SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article demonstrates how to enable reverse Domain Name System
(DNS) lookup for Internet Information Services (IIS).

Enable Reverse DNS Lookup
-------------------------

WARNING: If you edit the metabase incorrectly, you can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall any product that uses the metabase. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that problems that result if you incorrectly edit the metabase
can be solved. Edit the metabase at your own risk.

NOTE: Always back up the metabase before you edit it.

To enable reverse DNS lookup on IIS 4.0 (which is included with Microsoft Windows
NT 4.0), IIS 5.0 (which is included with Microsoft Windows 2000), and IIS 5.1
(which is included with Microsoft Windows XP Professional), the EnableReverseDNS
metabase entry must be set to TRUE.

When the EnableReverseDNS metabase entry is set to TRUE, the IP address of each
Web client that connects to the IIS server is resolved to a DNS name, and the
DNS name instead of the Web client IP address is placed in the IIS log files.

   Q300672 HOW TO: Create a Metabase Backup in IIS 5

IIS 4.0
-------

1. Open a command prompt.

2. Change the folder to %systemroot%\Inetsrv\Adminsamples.

3. Type "adsutil set w3svc/EnableReverseDNS TRUE" (without the quotation marks),
   and then press ENTER.

IIS 5.0 and IIS 5.1
-------------------

1. Open a command prompt.

2. Change the folder to C:\Inetpub\Adminscripts.

3. Type "adsutil set w3svc/EnableReverseDNS TRUE" (without the quotation marks),
   and then press ENTER.

Warnings
--------

Enabling reverse DNS on your IIS server can affect the performance of your Web
server and DNS servers. Some examples are:

 - Resources such as CPU utilization and network bandwidth may be taken up.

 - Client requests can take longer to process.

 - Client requests can be blocked if IP restrictions by DNS domain names are
   used.
