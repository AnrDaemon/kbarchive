SUMMARY
=======

The "Account lockout" section of the Account Policy dialog box specifies how
Windows NT Server handles user accounts after several successive unsuccessful
logon attempts have occurred. When "Account lockout" is selected, users are
locked out after the specified number of successive bad attempts is reached.
Each domain controller (DC) maintains the number of BadPasswordCount for every
user account. The rest of this article explains how DCs maintain and correlate
the Account Lockout Policy.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To demonstrate the relationship between the Account Lockout and
BadPasswordCount, this article assumes that there is a single domain with one
backup domain controller (BDC).

Domain : Mydomain
PDC : PDCserver
BDC : BDCserver
Account: test1
Account lockout: 6 (After six attempts with a bad password, test1 account must be
locked out).

1. To make sure logon attempt is authenticated by BDC, enter test1 account with
   an incorrect password from BDC locally once.

2. From the primary domain controller (PDC), type the following to monitor
   BadPasswordCount:

   Nltest /user:test1 /server:BDCServer

   Nltest /user:test1 /server:PDCServer

   You will see the same BadPasswordCount. In this case, both are 0x1.

3. From the BDC, type the incorrect password six more times. Run the following
   commands on the PDC:

   Nltest /user:test1 /server:BDCServer

   Nltest /user:test1 /server:PDCServer

   Both output show 0x6 as a BadPasswordCount. The test1 account is locked out.

4. Open User Manager for Domain and unlock test1 account. As soon as this
   account is unlocked

   Nltest /user:test1 /server:PDCServer
   BadPasswordCount on PDC is 0x0.

   Nltest /user:test1 /server:BDCServer

   BadPasswordCount on BDC is 0x6.

   After test1 account is unlocked, it resets BadPasswordCount on PDC to 0x0. But
   Badpaswordcount on BDC is still 0x6 until the domain synchronization happens.
   Before the domain synchronization happens, if test1 user enters the incorrect
   password from the BDC(BDCServer), logon attempt increments the
   BadPasswordCount. But test1 account is not locked out. Because
   BadPasswordcount was 0x0 on PDC. It has been incremented to 0x1 on the PDC.
   After domain synchronization happens, BadPasswordCount on BDC is equal to the
   number on PDC, which will be 0x0.

5. If test1 user enters the correct password from the BDC, it resets
   BadPasswordCount to 0x0 on the PDC, not on the BDC, until the domain
   synchronization happens.

6. Account Lockout policy checks the PDC's BadPasswordCount. It does not use the
   BadPasswordCount value on the BDC. In the above case, even if another bad
   password attempt happens to BDC after BadPasswordCount exceeds the threshold
   on the BDC, the BDC does not request an urgent Account Lockout replication to
   PDC.
