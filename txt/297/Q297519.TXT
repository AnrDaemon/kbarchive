-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to browse the Active Server Pages (ASP) content of an Internet
Information Services (IIS) version 5.0 Web server, you may receive the following
error messages in the Event Viewer System log:

   Event ID: 10004; Source: DCOM
   DCOM got error "Logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested
   logon type at this computer. " and was unable to logon .\IWAM_MACHINENAME in
   order to run the Server:{3D14228D-FBE1-11D0-995D-00C04FD919C1}

   Event ID: 36; Source: W3SVC

   The server failed to load application '/LM/W3SVC/1/Root/'. The error was 'The
   server process could not be started because the configured identity is
   incorrect. Check the username and password'.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the IWAM_MACHINENAME and IUSR_MACHINENAME user
accounts do not have "Logon as a batch job" rights.

RESOLUTION
==========

Give "Logon as a batch job" rights to the IWAM_MACHINENAME and IUSR_MACHINENAME
accounts. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Administrative Tools menu, expand Local Security Policies.

2. Select User Rights Assignment.

3. Select the IWAM_MACHINENAME and IUSR_MACHINENAME accounts.

NOTE: If domain level policy settings are defined, they override local policy
settings. Make sure that the Effective Policy Setting is also selected (this
setting is dimmed). Contact your domain administrator if this setting is not
selected.
