TITLE   :Event ID 5718 Generated During LSA Database Replication
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfile kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During link state algorithm (LSA) database replication from the primary domain
controller (PDC) to the backup domain controller (BDC), the following
information may be recorded in Event Viewer:

   Event ID 5718
   The full synchronization replication of the LSA database from the primary
   domain controller <servername> failed with the following error:
   The system cannot find the file specified.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Security hive has become corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, copy the Security hive from another BDC to the BDC on
which the event information is recorded:

1. Perform a parallel installation of Windows NT 4.0 on the BDC on which the
   event information is recorded.

2. On a reliable (working) BDC, update the repair folder by using the Repair
   Disk (RDISK) utility.

3. Copy the following folder from the reliable BDC to a temporary folder on the
   BDC on which the event information is recorded:

   %SystemRoot%\Repair\Security

4. Start the BDC on which the event information is recorded, by using the
   parallel Windows NT 4.0 installation.

5. In the original Windows NT 4.0 installation, rename the following folders:

   %SystemRoot%\Repair\Security
   %SystemRoot%\Repair\Security.log

6. Expand the Security folder that you created in step 3, and then copy the
   folder to the following location of the original Windows NT installation:

   %SystemRoot%\System32\Config\Security

7. Start the BDC on which the event information is recorded, in the original
   installation.

8. On the PDC, use the netdom command utility to reset the secure channel on the
   BDC. Use the following syntax

   "netdom BDC \\<BDC Name> /reset" (without the quotation marks)

   where <BDC Name> is the computer name of the BDC.
