SYMPTOMS

After you install Computer Associates ARCserve 6.6 Standard Version, you may
receive one or both of the following error messages:

   Liccheck.exe - DLL Initialization Failed
   Initialization of dynamic link library c:\winnt\system32\cstool.dll failed.
   This process is terminating abnormally.

   Liccheck.exe - DLL Initialization Failed
   Initialization of dynamic link library c:\winnt\system32\wstwsp.dll failed.
   This process is terminating abnormally.

The error message typically appears within one or two days after you install

causes a memory leak.

the ARCserveIT Discovery Agent Service.
