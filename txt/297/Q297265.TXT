TITLE   :INFO: All Bound IP Addresses Don't Appear in MMC Drop-Down List
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgrpdsvc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you administer Internet Information Server (IIS) through the Microsoft
Management Console (MMC) snap-in, a Web site's IP Address drop-down list box may
not display all of the IP addresses that are bound to the network interfaces.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IIS MMC snap-in uses either the gethostbyname or gethostbyaddr Windows
Sockets function to obtain the list of IP addresses for a computer, depending on
whether you specify a server name or server address, respectively. These
functions use one of several methods (including WINS, DNS, the HOSTS file) to
retrieve the IP addresses for a computer. For additional information about the
order in which these methods are used, click the article number below to view
the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q192128 PRB: gethostbyname() Retrieves Only One IP Address from WINS

To ensure that the IP list that is displayed is correct, confirm that all the
necessary IP addresses are entered correctly for the local HOSTS file or the DNS
server that is used for name resolution. If WINS is used for resolution, only
one IP address may be returned. (See Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q192128
for more information.)
