======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Client Setup may not start on a Windows 2000-based domain controller because the
replication of the SMS#_<DCname> account creation takes longer than 60
minutes on a large Windows 2000 Active Directory site. The same symptoms occur
if the replication for the temporary bootstrap account succeeds in time and the
SMS#_<DCname> client service account is created.
