TITLE   :XADM: Mbclean Cleans Msgs. by PR_LAST_MODIFICATION_TIME in SP4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange550preSP5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 (SP3), Mailbox Manager deleted mail based
on the delivery date and time of the mail in a mailbox. In Exchange Server 5.5
Service Pack 4 (SP4), mail is deleted based on the last modified date and time.
Therefore, mail that has been moved around is not being deleted even though the
delivery date and time is past the age limit.

RESOLUTION
==========

correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
