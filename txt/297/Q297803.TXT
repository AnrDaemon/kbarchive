The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to preview a report for a second time while a preview window from
that report is still active, Visual FoxPro (VFP) may crash.

RESOLUTION
==========

Test for an existing window by using the WEXIST function. To do this, add the
following code before the REPORT command in the code that is given in the "More
Information" section.

   WEXIST("Report Designer - testreport.frx")

VFP detects that a window is already open for this report and does not attempt to
open a second preview window for the same report.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 7.0 for Windows.
