SYMPTOMS
========

You call MSN Internet Access Technical Support with questions about a DirectPC
connection.

The DirecPC software attaches a "tunneling code"--essentially an electronic
addressing mask--to the Web address you request in your browser. That code
instructs the Internet Service Provider (ISP, in this case MSN) to forward the
URL request to the DirectPC Network Operations Center (NOC) instead of to the
server for the site that you requested.

After the NOC receives your request, the tunneling code is stripped away and the
request is forwarded via multiple T-3 lines to the appropriate site, and the
desired Web site is retrieved for you. The NOC then uploads the information to
the DirecPC satellite, and beams it down to your DirecPC dish and into your
computer.

While you can use MSN Internet Access in conjunction with Direct PC, MSN Internet
Access technical support handles e-mail and connectivity issues relating to
dial-up Internet Access. For detailed support information about DirectPC,
contact a local DirectPC satellite technical support center.

CAUSE
=====

This is a misdirected call; MSN Internet Access Technical Support handles issues
relating to connectivity and e-mail for MSN Internet Access dial-up service.

RESOLUTION
==========

Please contact DirectPC to resolve DirectPC-related connectivity issues. For
