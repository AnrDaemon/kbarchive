======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Format function produces different results after you migrate a Visual Basic
application from version 5.0 to version 6.0.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you do not specify enough placeholders. The number of
placeholder characters must equal the number of characters in the string that
you are trying to format. In this case, the Format function must make
assumptions about how to fill in the remaining characters.

For example, suppose that you want to format the string "Microsoft", so you make
the following call to the Format function:

   Format("Microsoft","@-@")

Because you have not supplied enough at signs (@), the Format function must
decide from which end it must start to fill in the remaining characters. The
output differs depending on which end the function starts, which differs between
Visual Basic versions 5.0 and 6.0.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, always supply the correct number of placeholder
characters. If you use the preceding example, change the call to the Format
function as follows:

   Format("Microsoft","@-@@@@@@@@")

MORE INFORMATION
================

Suppose that you make the following call to the Format function:

   Format("Microsoft","@-@")

In Visual Basic 5.0, the placeholders are filled in from right to left, and the
following output is returned:

   Microsoft-t

However, this behavior changes in Visual Basic 6.0. In Visual Basic 6.0, the
placeholders are filled in from left to right. As a result, the following output
is returned:

   M-icrosoft

Additional query words: vba
