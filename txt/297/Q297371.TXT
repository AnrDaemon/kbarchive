TITLE   :Unexpected High Memory Usage When You Use Index Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use third party IFilter components with Index Server, the Cidaemon
process may consume a large amount of memory. This may cause a low memory
situation on the server, and the server processing may slow down.

CAUSE
=====

The Cidaemon process is designed as a sandbox for IFilter components, which
means that every IFilter is loaded into this process. Thus, if an IFilter is
poorly designed or coded, the IFilter can cause Cidaemon to consume a large
amount of memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, contact the IFilter vendor, and request a fixed IFilter
component.

WORKAROUND
==========

Index Service 3.0 (Microsoft Windows 2000) introduces a new mechanism that
limits the memory usage of the Cidaemon process. The Cisvc process monitors the
memory consumption of the Cidaemon process. If the Cidaemon exceeds 40 megabytes
(MB) of memory usage, the Cisvc process automatically ends and restarts the
Cidaemon process. This mechanism prevents the server from reaching a low memory
situation and a slow down in server processing.
