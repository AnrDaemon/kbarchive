======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0 child or secondary sites may cause a
"storm" of status messages to be sent to the primary site. Specifically, Site
Control Manager may repeatedly create 10 status messages each second. The
following information is an example of one iteration of the problem:

   

   ------
   Processing delta site control file 
   "C:\SMS\inboxes\sitectrl.box\incoming\8B4NFYM5.CT1"...
   the delta site control file 
   "C:\SMS\inboxes\sitectrl.box\incoming\8B4NFYM5.CT1" contains a record 
   submitted by server component SMS_SITE_CONTROL_MANAGER running as user 
   SMSService on computer CAIXATEST on Fri Apr 20 21:21:42 GMT.

   TATMSG: ID=2808 <Rest of text deleted for readability>
   WARNING: The "Site Definition" item in a record contained in delta site 
   control file "C:\SMS\inboxes\sitectrl.box\incoming\8B4NFYM5.CT1" specifies
   an invalid public key for decrypting the SMS service account and password.
   This record and the remaining records in the file are unusable.

   TATMSG: ID=2847 <Rest of text deleted for readability>
   Deleted file "C:\SMS\inboxes\sitectrl.box\incoming\8B4NFYM5.CT1".
   WARNING: Aborted processing of delta site control file 
   "C:\SMS\inboxes\sitectrl.box\incoming\8B4NFYM5.CT1".  
   TATMSG: ID=2800 <Rest of text deleted for readability>
   TATMSG: ID=508 <Rest of text deleted for readability>
   TATMSG: ID=2804 <Rest of text deleted for readability>
   ------

The preceding iteration takes less than a second to complete. Typically two
iterations each second occur, which equals 10(5*2) status messages a second.
10*60*60 equals 360,000 status messages an hour.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if both of the following conditions exist:

 - The time zone has been changed.

 - The system Microsoft Windows NT Cryptography key has been reset.

NOTE: As of June 28, 2001, Microsoft NetMeeting with Remote Desktop sharing
enabled is known to reset the Windows NT Cryptography key. However, other
programs may also reset the key and satisfy the second condition for this
problem to occur.

==========

Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
