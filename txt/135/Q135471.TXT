TITLE   :Cannot Reconnect to OS/2 Name Space Resources on NetWare Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) to connect to a NetWare server
that has the OS/2 Name Space installed, and the connection is somehow
disconnected, you cannot reestablish the connection.

For example, if you press the F5 key to refresh a File Manager drive window
focused on a disconnected drive on the NetWare server, the message The Specified
Path Is Invalid appears in the right-hand pane of the drive window. The window
is not refreshed, and the connection to the NetWare server is not
reestablished.

This problem does not occur if the OS/2 Name Space is not installed on the
NetWare server.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in the reconnection code for OS/2 Name Space resources.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
