TITLE   :Regeneration of a Stripe Set With Parity Disk Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to regenerate an orphaned drive (stripe set with parity), the
following error message appears:

   The drive cannot be locked for exclusive use. Please check to see if some
   applications are currently accessing the drive. If so, close them and try
   again.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if Disk Administrator is not allowed exclusive access to the
stripe set volume. This is usually caused by having an open file on the volume
you are trying to regenerate.

A file is open when:

 - A paging file is located on the volume.

 - An application that was started from the volume is still running.

 - An application that is running has loaded a .DLL file from the volume.

 - An application has a file open on the volume.

 - An application's current directory is on the volume.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

If the error continues to appear after you have stopped all applications and
services that could be accessing the volume:

1. Remove the Page File.

   If there is a page file on the volume, define a page file of sufficient size
   on another volume and reboot the computer.

2. If you were running Microsoft Mail and or Schedule+, start Mail and choose
   Exit and Sign Out from the file menu.

   Microsoft Mail and or Schedule+ have hidden processes that run in the
   background.

3. If you run a Systems Management Server client, close the two hidden Systems
   Management Server processes: APPCTL32 and PCMWIN32.

   Use KILL.EXE from the PSSTOOLS directory on the Systems Management Server CD,
   or Process Viewer from the Windows NT Resource Kit to terminate the
   processes.

4. If you log on to the machine with any logon script containing any Systems
   Management Server batch file, then remove the batch file from the logon
   script and log on again before starting the regeneration.

5. To make the volume inaccessible to any processes and to ensure disk
   administrator can lock the volume, go into Disk Administrator, select Tools,
   Assign Drive Letter, click the "Do not assign a drive letter" radio button,
   click OK, select Partition from the menu and then select Commit Changes Now,
   exit Disk Administrator, reboot the system and then try to regenerate the
   stripe set with parity.
