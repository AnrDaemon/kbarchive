OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAPI kbSDKPlatform kbNetAPI kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a 16-bit program that calls the NetUserAdd() application
programming interface (API), a General Protection (GP) fault occurs.
This symptom occurs sporadically.


CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in the NETAPI.DLL file where the segment passed in the call
is not used.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the LocalAlloc() API to allocate the buffers
used to pass the server name, user name, and password.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
