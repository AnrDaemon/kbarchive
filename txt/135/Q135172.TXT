SYMPTOMS
========

After you install and configure a CableTron T2015 Token Ring network adapter in
a Windows 95-based computer to work with a 4 Mbps Token Ring network using the
T2015.dos NDIS 2 driver, you find that you cannot access the network after you
restart the computer.

CAUSE
=====

Setup places a parameter for ring speed in both the registry and the
Protocol.ini file. The NDIS 2 driver does not read the Protocol.ini file for
this parameter correctly and remains set at the factory-default speed of 16
Mbps.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the Protocol.ini file. Change the
line that reads

   BANDWIDTH=1

to read:

   " BANDWIDTH=4 " (without the quotation marks)

After you make this change, save and close the Protocol.ini file, and then
restart your computer.
