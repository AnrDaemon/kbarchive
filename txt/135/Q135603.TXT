The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5,3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5,3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, versions 3.5, 3.51

SUMMARY
=======

You can run 16-bit Windows-based applications in their own memory space under
Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51. This is most easily accomplished by selecting the
program icon in Program Manager, choosing Properties from the File menu, and
selecting "Run in Separate Memory Space."

Because the Microsoft Office Toolbar does not use Program Manager you need to
create a custom Application Button to run a 16-bit application in its own memory
space.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following procedure explains how to run a 16-bit Windows-based application
in its own address space. It uses Microsoft Excel as an example.

1. Create a batch file containing the following commands:

   start /separate /b d:\msoffice\excel\excel.exe
   exit

   This example refers to the batch file as C:\BAT\SAMPLE.BAT

2. Start the toolbar by running Microsoft Office from the Microsoft Office
   Program Group.

3. Click the application button, on the far right hand side of the toolbar, for
   creating customized buttons. Choose Customize.

4. In the Customize dialog box, choose Toolbar and then choose Add. Fill in the
   fields as follows:

   Description: Custom Excel
   Command Line: c:\bat\sample.bat
   Working Directory: <As desired>
   Button Image: <As desired>
