SUMMARY
=======


The "System Management Server Administrator's Guide" incorrectly states the
following in Appendix C in the "Detecting Status for Run Command On Workstation
Jobs" section, paragraph one:

   The Package Command Manager places the file in the DESPOOLER.BOX directory
   specified by the 'ResultsSharePoint' entry in the Logon server's SMS.INI
   file.

There is no SMS.INI file on the logon server. The file name should be DOMAIN.INI.
The entry should be ResultSharePoint not ResultsSharePoint. Inventory Agent or
Client Setup copies the ResultSharePoint from the Systems Management Server
section in DOMAIN.INI file to the ResultSharePoint in the "Package Command
Manager" section in the SMS.INI file. PCM reads the local SMS.INI file to
determine where to write the .SNI file.
