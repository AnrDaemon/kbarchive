PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0

KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running a Visual FoxPro formset results in the error "Feature Not Available"
when a READ is executed in the Load event of a form.

CAUSE
=====

A READ in the Load event of a form in a formset causes the error. However, if
the form is not contained in a formset, the error doesn't occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are several workarounds. The READ must be removed from the Load event of
the form in order for the form to run in a formset. Here are some possible
workarounds:

 - Place the READ in the Load event of the formset.

 - If the READ is being used to activate a window, perhaps a message box can be
   used as an alternative to the window.

 - Remove the formset.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Within the Form Designer, on the Form menu, click Create Form Set.

3. Add the following code to the Load event of the form:

      DEFINE WINDOW confirm FROM 1,1 TO 10,10
      ACTIVATE WINDOW confirm
      x= " "
      @ 5,5 GET x
      READ
      RELEASE WINDOW confirm

4. Run the Form. The error "Feature Not Available" will occur. To resolve the
   issue, open the form in the Form Designer. Then on the Form menu, click
   Remove Form Set, and run the form.
