TITLE   :Login Script GOTO Command Finds Wrong Target Label
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your Novell NetWare login script contains a GOTO command, processing may
continue at the wrong label.

CAUSE
=====

The labels are not being parsed correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Your NetWare administrator should examine the login scripts and change the
labels so that no label name is a subset of another.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The parsing error occurs if one label is identical to the right-most characters
of another. For example, the following will be parsed incorrectly:

   WRONG_LABEL:
   GOTO LABEL
   LABEL:

In this example, the GOTO command will cause processing to jump to the line above
the GOTO command, rather than the line below.
