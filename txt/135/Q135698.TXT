 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Windows 95 Backup tool, you cannot save the current file
set until you select the files to back up and a destination for the backup
files. After you click the Start Backup button and back up the files, you cannot
save the file set.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure to save the file set before you click the Start Backup button to begin
backing up the files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Save and Save As commands become available on the File menu after you select
the files to back up and a destination for the backup files. You should save the
file set before you begin backing up the files, because the list of files to
back up and the destination are no longer selected after the backup is finished.
