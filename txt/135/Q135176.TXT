TITLE   :MS-DOS-Based Program Does Not Detect VESA Graphics
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running an MS-DOS-based program in a windowed MS-DOS session, the
program may report one of the following errors:

   - High-resolution graphics are not available

   - VESA graphics are not available

   - SVGA graphics are not available

CAUSE
=====

These programs perform a VESA service call to query the device capabilities. In
order to satisfy the request, the MS-DOS session must be converted to
full-screen so that the BIOS can inspect the video hardware and obtain the
correct information about the device capabilities.

Under certain circumstances, Windows 95 may fail to do this conversion
automatically, resulting in the program not detecting the availability of
high-resolution graphics.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the program to run in a full-screen MS-DOS session. To do so, follow
these steps:

1. In Windows Explorer or My Computer, use the right mouse button to click the
   program's icon, and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

2. Click the Screen tab.

3. Click the Full-Screen option button.

4. Click OK.

Run the program by double-clicking the program icon instead of typing its name at
an MS-DOS prompt, so that the appropriate configuration is applied to the
program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some programs query VESA device capabilities without immediately using the
information returned. Such programs are converted to full-screen at the time the
query is made, even though the program does not appear to be using graphics.

The Epsilon editor from Lugaru (version 7.0) exhibits this behavior.
