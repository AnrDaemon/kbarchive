======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the PageOrder property of a page on a pageframe, the Page Name
value will become invalid. Issuing the following in the debug window, returns
the name of the page that was located in that position prior to changing the
PageOrder:

      <Formname>.PageFrame1.Pages[<Formname>.Pageframe1.ActivePage].Name

NOTE: <Formname> is replaced with the name of your form.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a new form and add a pageframe to the form.

2. Set the PageCount property of the form to 3.

3. Select the PageFrame, click the secondary (right) mouse button, and click
   Edit. Add a text box to each page of the PageFrame.

4. Change the PageOrder property of Page1 to 2.

5. Save the form as Test1.

6. Run the form.

7. On the Tools menu, click Debug. (Click Debugger for Visual FoxPro 5.0 and
   6.0)

8. Type the following into the Debug window (the Watch window in Visual FoxPro
   5.0 and 6.0):

      TEST1.PageFrame1.Pages[TEST1.Pageframe1.ActivePage].Name

If you click Page2, the debug window shows Page1 as the page name. The page name
should be Page2.
