SUMMARY
=======

In the Add and Remove example from the Controls application, the form
frmaddremove defines a new property called coldconfirm. This property is not
used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The coldconfirm property description states that this new property is used to
save the previous SET CONFIRM setting before the form is called. In the Add and
Remove example from the Controls application this property is not used because
the form is using a private data session. The Load event procedure states this
fact. The following comment is taken from the Load event procedure of the
frmaddremove form:

   * Because the CONFIRM setting is scoped to the data session, which
   * is scoped to the form, there is no need to store the existing
   * setting and restore it when the form is closed.
