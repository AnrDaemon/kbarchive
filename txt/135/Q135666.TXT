======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0, 4.1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the MFC database classes with the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver
versions 2.50.0121 or 2.50.0126 may cause an assertion failure after a call to
SQLNumResultCols() in the CFieldExchange::GetColumnType() function.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by a bug in the ODBC driver that is exposed when the cursor
library is used, and happens after calling CRecordset::Requery() and then trying
to edit more than one record.

The following code in Dbrfx.cpp produces the assertion:

   #ifdef _DEBUG
     SWORD nResultColumns;
     AFX_SQL_ASYNC(m_prs,
                   ::SQLNumResultCols(m_prs->m_hstmt, &nResultColumns));
     ASSERT(nColumn >= 1 && (long)nColumn <= (long)nResultColumns);
   #endif //_DEBUG

::SQLNumResultCols returns 0 in nResultColumns, which causes an assertion on the
next line. This is due to a bug in the driver which sets the number of columns
in the result set to 0. The subsequent call to ::SQLDescribeCol will also fail
with SQL State S1002 "Invalid Column number" regardless of the column number
specified.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use a dynaset instead of a snapshot or get the
2.65.0240 version of the SQL Server driver that is included with Visual C++
5.0.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug with the ODBC 2.5 components. This bug
has been fixed in the 2.65.0240 version of the SQL Server driver that is
included with Visual C++ 5.0.
