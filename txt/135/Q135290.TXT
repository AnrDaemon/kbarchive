======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message appears when you start File Manager:

   Application Exception Occurred: App:EXE/WINFILE.DBG [PID+135] <time>
   <date> Exception # C0000005 [Access Violation]

CAUSE
=====

WINFILE.EXE is either corrupt or there is a corrupt registry entry. To determine
if the registry is corrupt:

1. Log off Windows NT.

2. Log on as another user.

3. Run File Manager.

If file manager starts without an error, the problem may be caused by a corrupt
registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct a corrupt registry entry:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree, go to the following key:

   \Software\Microsoft\File Manager.

3. Delete the Settings key.

4. Restart File Manager. It will now run with the default settings.

If the above procedure does not correct the problem, use the following steps to
troubleshoot for corrupt files:

1. Run Chkdsk /f

2. Use the Emergency Repair Disk to verify System files.

3. Rename the existing WINFILE.EXE and expand a new copy from original setup
   media.

NOTE: If any Service Packs have been applied to system, you need to reapplied
them if you run the Emergency Repair Disk against System Files or replace files
using the original setup media as the source.
