PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a,3.2,3.2a,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run IMPORT.EXE or REQMAIN.EXE, and you press the CTRL+C keys while it
is processing, the utility continues to process even though the CTRL+C key
combination displays on the screen.

NOTE: Data displayed by IMPORT and REQMAIN scrolls up one line for each CTRL+C
you press.

CAUSE
=====

MS-DOS traps the CTRL+C key combination while the IMPORT and REQMAIN utilities
continue to call MS-DOS functions. IMPORT and REQMAIN will continue to run until
they complete.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2, 3.2a,
and 3.5 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
