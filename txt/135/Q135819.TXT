SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a NetWare network printer, you may receive the following error
message:

   There was an error writing to LPTx: for printer (xxxxxx): There was a problem
   printing to the port. Check to make sure your printer is configured to use a
   valid port. This printer will be set to work offline. To save your print job
   in the local printer queue, click OK.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the NetWare printer path contains extended
characters.


RESOLUTION
==========

Instead of mapping the printer port and then printing to the port, print to the
print queue's Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path. To do so, follow these
steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the icon for the printer you want to
   change, and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

3. On the Details tab, type the UNC path for the printer in the Print To The
   Following Port box.

4. Click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
