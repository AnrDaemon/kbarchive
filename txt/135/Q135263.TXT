TITLE   :Reapply Layout Doesn't Work If Master Layout Is Deleted
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to reapply a slide layout to a particular slide, and when one
of the master layout placeholders has been deleted, the slide layout will not be
re-applied.

For example, if you rotate the body text object of a slide, and you then delete
the Master Body Text placeholder, reapplying the slide's layout will not return
the body text object to normal.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the following steps:

1. Switch to slide master view and reapply the master layout.

2. Return to slide view, and reapply the layout for that slide.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PowerPoint version 7.0 for
Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
