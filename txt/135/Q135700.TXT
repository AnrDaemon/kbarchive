TITLE   :Modifications to NETBT.SYS to Support Layered Drivers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========


Under Windows NT, when a device driver creates an I/O Request Packet (IRP) to
pass to an underlying driver, it creates the IRP with a fixed number of I/O
stack locations, one for each driver in the chain of layered drivers for which
the request is bound. Each stack location contains the parameters, function
codes, and context used by the corresponding driver to determine what it is
supposed to be doing with the request.

In Windows NT 3.51, I/O Request Packets built by the NETBT.SYS driver always have
a stack frame size of 1. This presents a problem should device driver developers
wish to "layer" an additional driver between NETBT.SYS and TCPIP.SYS because
there are not enough stack frames in the IRP for the vertical driver to use.

For certain operations, NetBT also incorrectly passes IRPs directly to TCP/IP,
thereby skipping any intermediate drivers in the driver chain.

==========
