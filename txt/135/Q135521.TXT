TITLE   :PRB: Send Does Not Work Under Windows 95 or Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If 16-bit Microsoft Mail is used on a 32-bit operating system such as Windows 95
or Windows NT, various MAPI errors occur when trying to use the File Send
Command in Visual FoxPro. These same errors also occur when using the
MAPIsession and MAPImessage OLE controls from within a Visual FoxPro
Application.

CAUSE
=====

MAPI is finding the 32-bit version of MAPI.DLL and trying to load the 32-bit
mail client software. When using a MAPI session and message OLE controls under
Windows 95 or Windows NT, you must use the 32-bit mail client that is supplied
with these products.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Remove exchange (Windows 95) or the 32-bit version of Microsoft Mail (Windows
   NT) from the computer.

2. Install the 16-bit version of Microsoft Mail.

3. Start Visual FoxPro.

4. On the File menu, click Send.
