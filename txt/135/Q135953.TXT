SYMPTOMS
========

3D Landscape version 1.0 by Books That Work does not draw the screen correctly
if System Agent is running. When System Agent is running, the landscaping
symbols are drawn on top of each other in one corner of the screen, rather than
at their proper locations across the screen.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by an incompatibility in 3D Landscape 1.0. The problem is
more likely to occur when System Agent is running, but may occur even when
System Agent is not running.

RESOLUTION
==========

To run 3D Landscape 1.0, temporarily disable System Agent, and then run 3D
Landscape. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
   System Tools, and then click System Agent.

2. On the Advanced menu, click Stop Using System Agent.

3. When you are prompted to confirm that you want to stop using System Agent,
   click Yes.

4. Run 3D Landscape. When you are done using 3D Landscape, close the program.

5. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
   System Tools, and then click System Agent.

6. When you are prompted whether you want to run System Agent, click Yes.
