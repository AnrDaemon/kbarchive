TITLE   :Cannot Copy File Whose Filename Begins with a Period

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to copy a file, if the source or destination is a long filename
that starts with a period (.), you receive the error message "Path not found."

Note that this problem occurs only if you supply a path to the source or
destination file. For example,

   copy c:\path\to\.source destdir

or:

   copy source c:\path\to\.dest

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Command.com assumes that any filename beginning with
a period is a directory name, even though long filenames can begin with a
period.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use Windows Explorer to copy the file instead of
typing a COPY command at an MS-DOS prompt. Or, copy the file using its short
filename, and then rename the file.
