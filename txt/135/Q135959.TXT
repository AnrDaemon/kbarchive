TITLE   :Theme Not Deleted Using Desktop Themes Tool
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you click a theme in the Desktop Themes tool in Control Panel, and then click
Delete, the theme file is deleted and the next theme is loaded automatically.
The newly loaded theme is called Current Windows Settings in the Theme box, even
though it is not the current theme.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To fully remove an entire theme, use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control
Panel.

Using the Delete button in the Desktop Themes tool removes only the theme (.the)
file for that theme, not the theme itself.
