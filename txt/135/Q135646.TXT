WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To correct this problem, configure either a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or a
Backup Domain Controller (BDC) to be the time server of a domain and then
specify a time server by adding the following registry entry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters

   Value Name: timesource
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Data: 1
   Radix: Hex

Data set to 1 enables the server as a timesource. Stop and restart the Server
service so this change can take effect.
