The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you try to transfer a Fine Artist Pigture Show created on one computer to
another computer, you receive the following error message:

   Hey! Sorry, I can't find your file. You'll have to use a different one.
   Choose another file.

This error message occurs when Fine Artist can't find all the files on the second
computer that you used when you created the Pigture Show.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure you copy all the files (pictures) that you used to create the Pigture
Show, along with the Pigture Show file itself, when you transfer it to another
machine. Use the information below to determine which files you need to copy to
the disk or second computer.

Windows
-------

Copy the following files:

 - Pigture show file. For example: Filename.sld

 - Individual paintings referenced in Pigture show. For example: Filename.mag

Make sure the files are in the current user's folder. For example:

   C:\Mskids\Users\Chris

Macintosh
---------

Copy the following files:

 - Pigture show file (Its icon has images of 35mm slides on it).

 - Individual paintings referenced in Pigture show (These files' icons have
   paintbrushes on them).

Make sure the files are in the current user's folder. For example:

   Macintosh Hard Drive:Mskids:Users:Chris

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Pigture Show file consists of slide captions, transition effects and
transition sounds, as well as references (pointers) to documents created in Fine
Artist.

The files can be used with either the Windows or Macintosh version of Fine
Artist, but some filenames may have to be changed. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q125763 How to Transfer Kids Documents Between Macintosh and Windows

All of the files need to be accessible at any given time (that is, you cannot
store two pictures in the same picture show on different floppy disks if you
only have one floppy disk drive).
