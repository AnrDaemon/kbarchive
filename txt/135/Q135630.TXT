TITLE   :DOC: Incorrect Prototype & Memory Allocation for PX_Blob
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbole kbdocfix kbCtrl

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
    - Microsoft OLE Control Developer's Kit (CDK), versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for the prototype of PX_Blob in the CDK Books Online is shown
incorrectly as:

      BOOL PX_Blob( CPropExchange* pPX, LPCTSTR pszPropName,
    
         HGLOBAL*& hBlob, HGLOBAL hBlobDefault = NULL );

The actual prototype as shown in the CDK source code in Afxctl.h is:

      BOOL PX_Blob(CPropExchange* pPX, LPCTSTR pszPropName, HGLOBAL& hBlob,
    
         HGLOBAL hBlobDefault = NULL);

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that the third parameter is incorrectly listed as HGLOBAL*& hBlob in
the documentation and should instead be HGLOBAL& hBlob as shown in the
actual prototype.

There is also another error in the PX_Blob remarks section of the documentation.
It states the following incorrect information:

   Note that PX_Blob will allocate memory, using the new operator, when loading
   BLOB-type properties. Therefore, the destructor of your control should call
   delete on any BLOB-type property pointers to free up any memory allocated to
   your control.

This correct documentation should be as follows:

   Note that PX_Blob will allocate memory, using the Windows GlobalAlloc API,
   when loading BLOB-type properties. You are responsible for freeing this
   memory. Therefore, the destructor of your control should call GlobalFree on
   any BLOB-type property handles to free up any memory allocated to your
   control.

The problems described in this article were fixed in Visual C++, 32-bit edition,
version 4.0 and later.
