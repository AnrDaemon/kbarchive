SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer stops responding (hangs), or you see a blue screen with an error
message, after you close an MS-DOS session that contains a network command that
is still in progress when you close the session.

CAUSE
=====

During network operations in an MS-DOS session, your computer may send a request
to another computer that does not respond immediately. The problem stated above
can occur if you close the MS-DOS session, and then the other computer responds
to the network request.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not close an MS-DOS session while a network operation is in progress. Wait
for any network command that you issue to finish.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If your computer is configured to run login scripts, an MS-DOS window starts
when you log on. Do not close this command window, or the problem stated above
may occur.
