SUMMARY
=======

Page 347 in the Developer's Guide shows a picture of a toolbar with a caption of
"Desktop Attributes." Following the toolbar is a code example to create the
pictured toolbar. However, the code example's caption for the toolbar is "Form
Attributes" instead of "Desktop Attributes."

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To have the code example produce the pictured toolbar, change:

      Caption = "Form Attributes"

to:

      Caption = "Desktop Attributes"
