The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, versions 3.11, 3.11a, 3.11b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a Winsock application creates a window (hidden or not) to process connection
messages from a non-blocking socket, the application may stop responding (hang)
on the second connection attempt.

CAUSE
=====

If a Winsock application creates a window to processes Winsock messages for the
connection, and the application deletes the window before the socket is closed,
the application may appear to hang if it attempts to establish a new connection.
Because the socket was not closed before the window was deleted, additional
Winsock messages may be generated. Because the window that these Winsock
messages are destined for no longer exists, the messages are undeliverable.
These undelivered messages cause the application to hang.
