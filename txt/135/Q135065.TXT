TITLE   :Windows NT 3.51 Hangs on Shutdown
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If Windows NT 3.51 is installed on a NEC Image P90 with an Adaptec 2940, Windows
NT may hang when you choose to Shutdown and Restart Windows NT.

CAUSE
=====

When you run Windows NT Setup, it detects and reserves the memory address range
where the system ROM resides. Under Windows NT 3.51, the memory where the system
ROM resides on the NEC Image P90 is not being reserved. When the device driver
for the Adaptec 2940 initializes, it allocates a memory address range to be
assigned to the controller. Because the address range where the system ROM is
locate was not marked as allocated, the Adaptec driver may allocate it. When the
system is shutdown, control is eventually passed to the system ROM, which
resides in an address range the Adaptec driver mapped to the controller. Because
of this, the system ROM code never gets control to reboot the system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
