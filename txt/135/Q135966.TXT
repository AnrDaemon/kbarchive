TITLE   :"A DLL Initialization Routine Failed" Setting Up MS Plus!
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 Setup, you may receive the
following error message after you choose the installation folder:

   Custom Action Error
   A Dynamic Link Library (DLL) initialization routine failed.

CAUSE
=====

Setup could not load either the Dskapi16.dll or Dskapi32.dll file. This can
occur if the files are mismatched, or if one of them is zero bytes in size.

RESOLUTION
==========

Method 1
--------

Delete or rename both of these files in the Windows\System folder and then run
Microsoft Plus! Setup again. If you cannot rename or delete the files, restart
Windows 95 and then try again.

Method 2
--------

Delete or rename both of these files in the Windows\System folder and then
extract a new copy of the Dskapi16.dll and Dskapi32.dll files. To do so, type
the following command at a command prompt

   " extract /a <sdrive>:\plus_1.cab dskapi*.dll /l
   <hdrive>:\<windir>\system " (without the quotation marks)

where <sdrive> is the drive containing the Microsoft Plus! CD-ROM or floppy
disk, <hdrive> is the drive containing Windows 95, and <windir> is
the Windows folder.

For additional information about using the Extract tool, type "extract" (without
quotation marks) at a command prompt, or see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
