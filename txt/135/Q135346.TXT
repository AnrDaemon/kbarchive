TITLE   :I/O Port or Memory Address Conflicts in Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove a driver for a PCI device, keep the device enabled in the
computer BIOS, and add another PCI device, Windows NT may assign the same I/O
port or memory address used by the previous device driver to the new PCI device
driver.

CAUSE
=====

When a new PCI device driver requests an I/O port or memory address, Windows NT
does not check for unused addresses. The I/O port or memory address usage in
Windows NT is registered through the device drivers.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following before adding the new PCI
device:

 - Disable the device using the same I/O port or memory address in the computer
   BIOS.

 - Physically remove the device from the computer.

 - Add the device driver back (this registers the I/O port or memory address in
   Windows NT).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
