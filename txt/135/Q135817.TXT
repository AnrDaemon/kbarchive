TITLE   :BUG: Mouse Down Triggered on a Minimized Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MouseDown event of a form occurs when the user presses a mouse button when
the form has the focus. It is very useful when trying to detect mouse clicks or
performing a specific action when the mouse is pressed. Forms created in Visual
FoxPro running under Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, and Windows 95 execute
code in their MouseDown events when the Form is minimized. This behavior is not
expected because MouseDown events should occur only when the Form is active.

WORKAROUND
==========

Place the following code in the MouseDown event of the form:

      IF THISFORM.WindowState <> 1
         FORM::MouseDown
         * Any event, such as wait window prevents the default MouseDown event
      ENDIF

With this code, the default MouseDown event code will fire only if the window is
not minimized.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a new form in Visual FoxPro running under Windows 3.1, Windows 95, or
   Windows for Workgroups.

2. Place the following code in the MouseDown event procedure:

      WAIT WINDOW "MouseDown"

3. Run the form.

4. Minimize the form.

5. Click the minimize icon with the right or left mouse button. The MouseDown
   event occurs.

NOTE: This behavior is platform specific. If steps 1 through 5 are performed
under Windows NT, the MouseDown event executes before the form appears on the
screen and does not respond when the form is active.
