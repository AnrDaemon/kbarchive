TITLE   :"List Name From" List Box Shows Only 20 Trusted Domains
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After establishing more than twenty trust relationships, User Manager and File
Manager do not list all the trusted domains. The Add Users and Groups dialog box
List Name From list box lists only twenty domains plus the current domain name.
Permissions can be successfully assigned by manually typing in the appropriate
user account or group from an unlisted trusted domain.

CAUSE
=====

When there are many trusted domains in a network, attempts to enumerate trusted
domain names require multiple calls to the LSA API. The LSA API indicates this
by returning ERROR_MORE_DATA as a status code to the calling routine. In this
case, the calling routine overwrites the returned status code of ERROR_MORE_DATA
before it checks the status again to see if additional calls to the LSA API are
necessary.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server version
4.0.

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not already done
so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT Workstation or Server version 4.0.
