-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95, the file copy gauge shows that
all the files have been copied, but you may experience one or more of the
following problems:

 - Setup does not install the Dial-Up Networking Server component.

 - The Internet Setup Wizard does not work correctly.

 - You cannot preview desktop bitmaps in Desktop Themes.

CAUSE
=====

Some Microsoft Plus! features require the installation of additional Windows 95
components. Because of this, Microsoft Plus! Setup may not correctly estimate
the amount of required free space on the hard disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you can determine which Windows 95 component still needs to be installed, try
to install it using the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. Otherwise,
free additional space on the hard disk and then reinstall Microsoft Plus!.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It may be necessary to remove Microsoft Plus! or the optional Windows 95
component before you reinstall Microsoft Plus!.
