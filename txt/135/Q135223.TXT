SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up Windows 95 on a computer with a Reveal TV300 adapter installed,
the screen turns red during the hardware detection portion of Setup. The
detection process continues, but the screen remains red.

CAUSE
=====

This problem appears to be caused by the TV300 adapter interfering with the
detection of the video adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Connect the monitor directly to the video adapter and then run Setup again.

 - Remove the TV300 adapter from the computer, run Setup again, and then
   reinstall the TV300 adapter after Setup is finished.

 - Contact the manufacturer of the TV300 adapter for information about using
   this product with Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Reveal TV300 adapter lets you view television programs on the computer
monitor. The adapter uses a pass-through cable to connect the monitor first to
the TV300 adapter and then the video adapter.
