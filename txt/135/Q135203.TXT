======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are restoring files with Backup, you may receive the following error
message:

   There is not enough disk space to continue this operation. Delete one or more
   files on the disk, and then try again.

The files that are restored before you receive the error message are intact.

CAUSE
=====

The backup contains more files than will fit on the hard disk. This situation
may occur if you back up a compressed drive and then restore the files to an
uncompressed drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

Since you cannot restore and compress files simultaneously, restore and then
compress the files in an alternating series of partial operations.
