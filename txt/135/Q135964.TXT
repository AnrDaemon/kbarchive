1. Restart your computer in MS-DOS mode.

2. Change to the Windows\System directory.

3. Type the following line at the MS-DOS command prompt

   " extract <drive>:\plus_2.cab dskmaint.dll " (without the quotation
   marks)

   where <drive> is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive containing the
   Microsoft Plus! CD-ROM, or of the floppy disk drive containing disk 2 of the
   original Microsoft Plus! disks.

4. Restart your computer normally.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you do not have Microsoft Plus! installed, extract the Dskmaint.dll file from
the Precopy2.cab file on your original Windows 95 disks or CD-ROM.
