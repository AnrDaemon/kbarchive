TITLE   :PRB: Long Field Names Interfere with the Append Command
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you append records from a version 2.x table onto the end of a version 3.0
table and the version 3.0 table has long field names and is part of a database,
Visual FoxPro says the records were added, but they weren't.

CAUSE
=====

The version 3.0 table has long field names. These interfere with the Append
operation.

WORKAROUND
==========

The easiest workaround is to rename the long fields to match the field names
contained in the version 2.x table; then redo the APPEND FROM operation. When it
finishes, rename the fields in the version 3.0 table back to their original
names. If you have indexes on your version 3.0 table, Visual FoxPro will object
to the name change, so you must also temporarily modify your indexes so that the
field names in the indexes match the field names in the table, or delete the
indexes.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

================

Code to Demonstrate Behavior
----------------------------

The following code demonstrates this behavior. To resolve this and allow the
APPEND FROM command to work, the fields in the Testtab table should be shortened
to match the field names in the Testtab2 free table.

   *--------------------------------------------------------------------*
   * Program: APNDTEST.PRG                                              *
   * Purpose: Demonstrates what happens when adding data from a free    *
   *          table to a table that has long field names and that is    *
   *          part of a database.                                       *
