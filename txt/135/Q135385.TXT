KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After suspending an error, using the CLEAR ALL command produces this error:

   Cannot clear the object in use.

Using the CANCEL command after this error causes Visual FoxPro to close (crash).
This happens only after using a version 2.x READ WHEN command.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no problem if you reverse the command sequence:

      CANCEL
         * Click OK to clear the "Cannot clear object in use" error message.
      CLEAR ALL

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro 3.0b
for Windows.
