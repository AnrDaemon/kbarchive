the Valid event of the grid before it fires the valid event of the current
control in the grid.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add a grid, and set its ColumnCount property to 1.

3. Add a command button to the form, outside the grid.

4. In the Valid event procedure of the grid, place this code:

      WAIT WINDOW "Valid of the Grid"

5. In the Valid event of Text1, the current control for the grid column, add
   this code:

      WAIT WINDOW "Valid of Grid Control"

6. From the Command window, open any table and then run the form. Position the
   cursor in the text box of the grid. Click the command button and note that
   the Valid event of the grid fires before the Valid event of Text1 fires.
