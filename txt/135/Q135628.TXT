TITLE   :PRB: Disabled Grid Column Allows Focus with Mouse Click
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Enabled property of a grid column is set to False (.F.), the insertion
point is not allowed to enter the column if accessed from the keyboard. However,
clicking the column moves the insertion point to the cell beneath the mouse
pointer. Even though no changes can be made, this behavior may be perceived as
confusing, and is inconsistent with other controls.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent the mouse click from activating a disabled column, check for the
nColIndex in the AfterRowColChange event to determine if the column is one which
should reject focus. If it is, reset focus back to the current cell by calling
the ActivateCell method.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine the last active cell, you need to ensure that the row and column
values are stored as a property of the form. Create two new properties named
OldRow and OldCol. To set the values, add the following lines of code to the
GotFocus event for each object in the grid that should receive focus:

      * code in Grid1.Column<n>.<Object>.GotFocus
      THISFORM.OldRow = THIS.PARENT.PARENT.ActiveRow
      THISFORM.OldCol = THIS.PARENT.PARENT.ActiveColumn

In the following example, the second column is disabled:

      * code in Grid1.AfterRowColChange event
      LPARAMETERS nColIndex      && supplied by method
      IF nColIndex = 2
          THIS.ActivateCell( THISFORM.OldRow, THISFORM.OldCol )
      ENDIF

Now when clicked, the disabled column will flash briefly. Then focus will return
to the last active cell selected.
