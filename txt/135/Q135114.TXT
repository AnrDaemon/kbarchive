TITLE   :PRB: Error "Library File Foxtools.fll is Invalid"
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to rebuild a converted FoxPro version 2.X project, you receive
this error message:

      Library file Foxtools.fll is invalid.

CAUSE
=====

The project is looking at the Foxtools.fll file that shipped with FoxPro version
2.X. It should be looking at the Foxtools.fll file that shipped with Visual
FoxPro version 3.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Remove Foxtools.fll from the Visual FoxPro project, and add the 32-bit
   Foxtools.fll found in your VFP subdirectory.

2. If your path to Foxtools.fll in the setup code of your 2.X screen was coded
   with a specific path statement (for example, using SET LIBRARY TO
   C:\Fpw26\Foxtools.fll instead of SYS(2004)+"Foxtools.fll"), look under the
   Load Event Method of the Form.

   With the editing window open for the Load Event, open the Object window in the
   title bar. You will see a systematically assigned id that looks something
   like _R2R0H0G9K. Open it up. You will discover your former Setup Code. Here
   you can manually edit the path to Foxtools.fll.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
