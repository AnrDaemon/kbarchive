TITLE   :PC NTMMTA: Err Msg: Can't Open Service Control Manager...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the Microsoft Mail Service Manager for the Mail Multitasking MTA for
Windows NT (NT MMTA), the \\<servername> field cannot be longer than 14
characters. If the entire field exceeds 14 characters, including the universal
naming convention (UNC), the following error may occur:

   Error: Can't open Service Control Manager. Check your access privileges on
   the specified server.

CAUSE
=====

The Remote Server text box accepts more than 14 characters; however, when you
press the Refresh button, the name is truncated to 14 characters.

If you use Network Monitor to trace what is send out on the network you will see
that there are only 14 characters in the broadcast.

WORKAROUND
==========

 - If the <servername> has up to 14 characters, do not enter the double
   backslash (UNC); only enter the Server Name, as demonstrated on page 12 of
   the NT MMTA "Administrator Guide."

-or-

 - Rename your servername to something less than 14 characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.5 of Microsoft Mail
Multitasking MMTA for Windows NT. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
