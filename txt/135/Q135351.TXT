======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer uses a special attachment (MEFPKG.DAT)
that is enclosed with a mail message. The attachment contains data and
information for the read form. The Electronic Forms Designer does not support
forms that have MEFPKG.DAT files larger than 64K.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you attempt to call the electronic form's MEFWriteItem function with an
attachment larger than 64K, you may get the following error:

   MEF_DISK_FULL

The reason for the 64K limit is not due to a size limitation on the electronic
forms attachment itself. The electronic forms MEFWriteItem function calls the
Microsoft Windows Application Program Interface (API) function,
WritePrivateProfileString, that has this limitation.

Additional information about the Windows API and WritePrivateProfileString can be
found in the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) "Programmer's
Reference."
