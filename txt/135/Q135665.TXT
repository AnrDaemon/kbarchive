PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you establish a network connection in an MS-DOS session (using the NET USE
command), the connection is not reestablished when you restart Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. Network connections established in an MS-DOS session
are not persistent connections.

RESOLUTION
==========

To create a persistent connection, create the network connection using the Map
Network Drive command in Windows Explorer. When you create the connection, click
the Reconnect At Logon check box.
