TITLE   :SMS NetMon Counters for Network Segment Object Show Wrong Info
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With the Network Monitor Agent installed, you can gather performance data using
Performance Monitor, which has the following counters, on the network segment
object:

 - Percent Multicast Frames

 - Percent Network Utilization

 - Broadcast Frames Received/second

 - Multicast Frames Received/second

 - Total Bytes Received/Second

 - Total Frames Received/Second

However, if you are running Network Monitor version 1.1 (included in Systems
Management Server 1.1) on Windows NT versions 3.1 or 3.5, the information shown
in these counters may be incorrect.


CAUSE
=====

Network Monitor 1.1 uses counters types that are only correct for Windows NT
version 3.51.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the Network Monitor 1.1 Agent and re-
install the Network Monitor 1.0 Agent.
