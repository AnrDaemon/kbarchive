======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you try to upgrade to
DriveSpace 3:

   Not enough free space on H (Host_For_C) to complete the task

You are then prompted to resize drive C to increase free space on drive H. If you
click Yes, you see an error message stating that Windows could not resize the
drive, and you are told to increase the free space on drive H to at least 4 MB.
You continue to receive this error message, no matter how much free space there
is on drive H.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when all of the following conditions exist:

 - Drive C is compressed with DriveSpace.

 - The compressed volume file for drive C is smaller than 67 MB.

 - The host drive for drive C has less than 2.2 MB of free space if no
   Failsafe.drv folder exists, or has less than 128K of free space if the
   Failsafe.drv folder does exist.


RESOLUTION
==========

Remove files on the host drive so that there is a least 2.2 MB of free space if
no Failsafe.drv folder exists, or at least 128K of free space if the
Failsafe.drv folder does exist.
