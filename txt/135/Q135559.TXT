The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information describes how many colors (and what color depths) are
available in Microsoft PowerPoint.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Internally, PowerPoint stores color information for every object using 24- bit
(16.7 million colors) color definitions. Therefore, if you insert a graphic that
contains 16.7 million colors, and you display it using a 24-bit display driver,
you see all the colors.

However, when you run a PowerPoint slide show on a system that has a 256- color
display driver, PowerPoint performs Palette Management. This means that
PowerPoint sends a palette to the display driver that contains the 256 colors
that it needs the most at that one time, and that PowerPoint can send a
different palette to the display driver whenever it deems it necessary (usually
when changing a slide).


As long as you are running a color depth of greater than 256 colors, you won't
have to worry about running out of colors. If you are running a color depth of
256 colors, and you have enough different graphics and gradients on a single
slide so that the slide requires more than 256 separate colors to display, you
may experience color loss, with or without an error message.
