The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

SNA Server Administrator uses internal APIs to manage and configure the SNA
Server domain. These APIs are not documented or exposed for developers to write
to.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For configuration (not management) of the SNA Server domain, you can use the
SNACFG.EXE command line utility and a script file to generate a custom
configuration without having to use SNA Server Administrator. See Appendix E of
the "SNA Server Administration Guide" for command-line interface specifics.
