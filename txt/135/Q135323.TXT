TITLE   :PPT7: Computer Appears to Hang if You Post Message to Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbui kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Post To Exchange on the File menu in PowerPoint for Windows 95,
version 7.0, the insertion point fails to change to an hourglass shape.

Even though you can drag the mouse and move the insertion point, you cannot click
on items on your screen until the message has been posted.

When this behavior occurs, it may appear that PowerPoint has stopped responding.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you use the Post To Exchange command, wait for the insertion point to
become fully functional again (even though this process may take a long time).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in PowerPoint 97 for
Windows.

Additional query words: 7.00 7.0 hung frozen locked hard
