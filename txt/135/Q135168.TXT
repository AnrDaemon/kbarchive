======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a PCMCIA disk drive into a PCMCIA slot, your computer beeps,
indicating that the PCMCIA card is recognized, but the disk drive is unavailable
in Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

A resource conflict may exist if the PCMCIA disk controller is configured to use
I/O ports 170-177 and your computer uses the same ports for some other purpose.

RESOLUTION
==========

Examine the computer settings in Device Manager. If the PCMCIA disk controller
is using ports 170-177, try either of the following methods to resolve the
conflict:

 - Reserve I/O ports 170-177, forcing Windows 95 to configure the PCMCIA disk
   controller at another I/O address. To do so, follow these steps:

    - In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

    - On the Device Manager tab, click Properties.

    - On the Reserve Resources tab, click the Input/Output (I/O) option button,
      and then click Add.

    - In the Start Value box, enter 170.

    - In the End Value box, enter 177.

    - Click OK until you return to Control Panel

    - Restart your computer.

   Windows 95 will not configure any device to use I/O ports 170-177 if it can
   avoid doing so.

 - Try disabling any secondary disk controller that uses I/O ports 170-177 in
   the computer's CMOS settings.
