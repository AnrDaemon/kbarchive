TITLE   :Typing Full Path and Filename Causes Inventory Rule to Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbConfig kbInventory smsinv smsconfig

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If you add an inventory rule for a package in the Systems Management Server
Administrator File Properties dialog box and type the full path to the file and
the filename, the following symptoms occur:

 - The inventory agent is unable to find the file.

 - If you add a property such as Checksum to the rule, you cannot obtain the
   value for that property.

CAUSE
=====

The rule parser requires that you type only the filename without the full path
to the file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, type the filename without the path to the file.

To retrieve the value of a property for the rule, choose the Browse button to
find the file (instead of typing the filename).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
