TITLE   :DriveSpace Does Not Mount Two CVFs with the Same Extension
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have two or more compressed drives, one of the compressed drives may not
be mounted because DriveSpace reports that it has already been mounted.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if two compressed volume files (CVFs) have the same
extension. For example, this problem can occur if one CVF is named Drvspace.002
and another CVF is named Dblspace.002.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename one of the CVFs so that it does not have the same extension as another.
Use a unique number between 001 and 255 for the extension. To rename a CVF,
follow these steps:

1. At an MS-DOS prompt, change to the drive and directory containing the CVF
   file you want to rename.

2. Type the following command

   " attrib -s -h -r <filename> " (without the quotation marks)

   where <filename> is the name of the CVF.

3. Type the following command

   " ren <filename> <new filename> " (without the quotation marks)

   where <filename> is the name of the CVF, and <new filename> is the
   new name for the CVF.

4. Type the following command

   " attrib +s +h +r <new filename> " (without the quotation marks)

   where <new filename> is the new name of the CVF.

5. Quit the MS-DOS prompt.

6. Restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DriveSpace cannot mount two CVFs with the same extension. When this occurs, the
CVF that is mounted depends on the .ini file that DriveSpace is using. For
example, if you have a Drvspace.003 and a Dblspace.003 file, and DriveSpace is
using the Dblspace.ini file for its configuration information, the Dblspace.003
file is mounted.
