TITLE   :Win32 CPIC CMEPLN Call May Return Truncated Partner LU Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a Windows NT CPIC application calls Extract_Partner_LU_Name (cmepln) and a
fully qualified partner LU name is configured within the CPIC side information
in the SNA Server configuration file, the last byte of the partner LU name is
truncated.

This problem occurs only with Windows NT-based programs. The correct partner LU
name is returned to Initialize_Conversation (cminit), so this problem occurs
only with the cmepln call.

CAUSE
=====


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the file SNABASE.EXE to correct this problem.

To work around the problem, configured the Partner LU name, from the CPIC
symbolic destination name properties dialog box, with an alias name rather than
a fully qualified name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
