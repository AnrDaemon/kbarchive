 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you try to start Windows 95:

   Insufficient memory to initialize Windows. Quit one or more memory- resident
   programs or remove unnecessary utilities from your Config.sys and
   Autoexec.bat files, and restart your computer.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur in a low-memory situation caused by real-mode drivers
loaded in memory, or when the hard disk containing the swap file is low on free
space.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove unnecessary drivers from the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files, restart
your computer, and then try to start Windows 95 again. If this does not work,
try freeing up three or more megabytes of space on the hard disk containing the
swap file.
