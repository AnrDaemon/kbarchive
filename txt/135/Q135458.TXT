The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Future tasks added in Schedule+ may appear to disappear when you enter them and
reappear close to or on the day that the task becomes due.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design if you have chosen to Show Active Tasks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you select Show Active Tasks in Schedule+, only the tasks that do not have
due dates and tasks that have due dates that are current will be displayed.
Tasks that have a due date set sometime after the current date will not be
displayed until the close to that day.

When you return to the Tasks display, the new task will not be visible. To view
future tasks select View All Tasks from the Tasks menu.

NOTE: When you view active tasks, Schedule+ will also show tasks that have future
due dates if the Start Work date is set to the current date or before.


Additional query words: 1.00a sched+ invisible plus
