TITLE   :DriveSpace 3 Cannot Compress Drive with 22 Local Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use DriveSpace 3 to compress a drive on a computer with 22 local
drives, you receive the following error message:

   Drive letters C through Z are in use. You need a free drive letter to mount a
   compressed drive.

   To free a drive letter, disconnect a network drive or unmount a compressed
   drive you aren't using now.

RESOLUTION
==========

To compress a drive on a computer with the configuration stated above, you must
add the line "firstdrive=Y" to the Drvspace.ini file. The Drvspace.ini file
should be located in the root directory of the compressed drive, and should have
its Hidden, Read-Only, and System attributes set. To remove these attributes (so
you can edit the file), type the following line at an MS-DOS prompt:

   " attrib -r -h -s drvspace.ini " (without the quotation marks)

Add the line "firstdrive=Y" (without the quotation marks) to the beginning of the
file, save and close the file, and then restart Windows 95.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
