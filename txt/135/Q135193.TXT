SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Q&E version 2.6.2 by InterSolve, your computer may lose
all network functionality.

CAUSE
=====

The installation procedure for this program overwrites the Windows 95 Netapi.dll
file with an older version of the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Extract a new copy of the Netapi.dll file from the original Windows 95 disks to
the Windows\System folder on the hard disk. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Insert disk 2 of the original Windows 95 disks in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

2. At an MS-DOS prompt, change to the drive containing disk 2, and then type the
   following command:

   " extract /a /d win95_02.cab netapi.dll " (without the quotation marks)

   Note the name of the cabinet file containing the Netapi.dll file.

3. Once you have located the Netapi.dll file, insert the appropriate disk in the
   drive, and type the following command

   " extract /l c:\<windows>\system <filename.cab> netapi.dll "
   (without the quotation marks)

   where <windows> is the name of your Windows folder, and
   <filename.cab> is the name of the cabinet file containing the
   Netapi.dll file.

4. Remove the floppy disk and restart Windows 95.

NOTE: These steps restore network functionality, but disable Q&E. You may
want to contact InterSolve to inquire about a possible upgrade to the program
that functions in Windows 95.
