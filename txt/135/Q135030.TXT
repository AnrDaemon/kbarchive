SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to create a LoopBack message for troubleshooting the
X.400 Mail Gateway.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Type the following:

   " x400adm admin -ppassword -d<drive letter to gateway po>" (without the
   quotation marks)

2. Select the Local MTA option, and get the following information:

    - Name:

    - Country Code:

    - Admd Name

   :     - Prmd Name:

   Click OK (ALT+O) to accept the changes, and go back to previous screen.

3. Select the Address Conversion option.

   The administrator must specify one address conversion string for each network
   name. One network address conversion string covers all postoffices with the
   same network name, even if they are not on the same local area network.

    - In the Network field, type the name of the Microsoft Mail network.

    - Set the Org Name to %net by tabbing to the field, then press ALT+N.

    - Set the Org Unit 1 to %post by tabbing to the field, then press ALT+P.

    - Set the Surname to %mbx by tabbing to the field, then press ALT+M.

    - Select Add (ALT+A).

    - Select OK (ALT+O) to return to the previous screen.

4. Select the Routing option. The routing table will look similar to the
   following:

   NOTE: The syntax is very important. The dots ".." must exist.

     c = country code <item b from Step 1>
     ..a = Admd Name <item c from Step 1>
     ....p = Prmd Name <item d from Step 1>
     ......o = Org Name <item g from Step 2> <Local MTA Name: Item 1>

5. After you complete the above steps, run the MS-DOS Mail client. Login as the
   Admin to the postoffice, and select Address, X400, Field. This will display
   the Field template.

   In the Field template, enter the following:

      - Country Code:                  <item b from Step 1>
      - Administration Domain name:    <item c from Step 1>
      - Private Domain Name:           <item d from Step 1>
      - Surname:                       <your mailbox name>
      - Organization name:             <Network name of the postoffice>
      - Organization Unit Names (OU):  <postoffice name>

   Press <Enter>
   At the Alias field, type in "LoopBack Account <Account Name>" (without
   the quotation marks)

6. The address is put into your Personal Address List (PAL). Press the ESC key
   until the Compose option appears.

7. Compose a message using the account above, and run the X400Gate program with
   the following command line options:

   X400gate -lvd -d< drive letter to PO >

   If the message is delivered, the X400Gateway should be configured correctly.
   If there are error messages in the MAILDATA\LOG\X400xxxx.LOG file, follow the
   troubleshooting steps to resolve the appropriate error message.

   NOTE: The xxxxx in the LOG file represents the date you run the gateway file.
   For example, if you run X400GATE.EXE on July 27, the filename would be
   X4000727.LOG.

More information about the X400 gateway can be found in the Microsoft Mail
Gateway to X.400 "Administrator Guide."
