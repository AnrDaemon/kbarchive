TITLE   :Cannot Access Macintosh Files on Windows NT Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot view or open certain Macintosh files or folders on a Microsoft
Windows NT server.

NOTE: This same behavior can occur anytime a Windows 95 client tries to view or
open a file that was created with a non-standard code page.

For example, if you create a file using the PanEuro version of Windows 95, you
cannot view the file in Windows 95 US version.

CAUSE
=====

The files or folders you cannot access contain extended characters in their file
name. Extended characters that are displayed as an underscore (_) are not in the
OEM/ANSI-to-Unicode or Unicode-to-OEM/ANSI mapping tables. The underscore
character is substituted for characters that cannot be mapped or displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename these files or folders using Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following characters are valid in file names in the Macintosh environment
but not in Windows 95:

   / 
   \ 
   *
   <
   >
   "
   |
   ?

If a Macintosh user creates a folder whose name contains any of these characters
and you try to open the folder in Windows 95, you receive the following error
message:

   The directory does not exist

This behavior can also occur if a Macintosh folder name contains a trailing space
or period at the end of the name.
