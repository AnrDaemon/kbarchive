TITLE   :NetWare Transaction Tracking System (TTS) Not Detected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On your computer running Windows NT, when you start a database client program
that connects to a database on a Novell NetWare server, the program generates a
warning message that the Novell NetWare server's Transactional Tracking System
(TTS) is not active, even though it is.

If you use your database application despite the warning, the index tables in the
server's database are destroyed.

This problem occurs if you run Windows NT Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) and
the database client program uses NetWare APIs to detect whether TTS is
available.

CAUSE
=====

CSNW does not correctly interpret the status information returned by the NetWare
server when it checks for the presence of TTS.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT 4.0 and the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
