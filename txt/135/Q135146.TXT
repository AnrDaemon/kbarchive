TITLE   :McAfee Secure Station Clock Drawn Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Application Manager included with McAfee Net Tools version 5.1
as your Windows 95 shell, Secure Station Clock is not redrawn correctly and
eventually fills up completely with black lines.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs only when Secure Station Clock is run with the McAfee
Application Manager specified as the Windows 95 shell.

McAfee Application Manager is a Windows 3.1-based program, and is not designed to
run in Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

McAfee does not recommend running Application Manager as the Windows 95 shell,
as it is a Windows 3.1-based program. When you use Secure Station Clock in
Windows 95 without using Application Manager as the shell, the problem does not
occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

McAfee Net Tools is manufactured by McAfee & Associates, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
