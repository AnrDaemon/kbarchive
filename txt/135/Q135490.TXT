SYMPTOMS
========

You have the following SDLC multidrop primary configuration problem:

 - If you assign a multidrop primary connection to a link service once, you are
   unable to assign other connections to it.

   -or-

 - If you assign a non-multidrop primary connection to a link service, for
   example, a peer to host connection, you cannot assign a multidrop primary
   connection to the link service.

These symptoms do not occur on standard SDLC leased or switched connections to
host systems where you select the Host system option in the SNA Admin Connection
Properties dialog box.

NOTE: A multidrop connection is a connection through which one primary computer
communicates with multiple secondary computers. SNA Server supports multidrop
connections to peer or downstream computers on leased SDLC lines. You can
configure up to four multidrop connections on each line, with an SNA server as
the primary server on each.
