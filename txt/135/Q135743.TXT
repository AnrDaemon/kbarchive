TITLE   :PPT7: No Clip Art Available to Import to ClipArt Gallery
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbusage kbclip

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start ClipArt Gallery for the first time after installing PowerPoint
for Windows 95, version 7.0, there may not be any clip art to import into the
ClipArt Gallery.

CAUSE
=====

The probable cause is that you chose to run a Custom installation of PowerPoint
7.0 but did not select Clip Art as one of the components to install. Clip Art is
not selected by default in the Custom installation.

NOTE: This behavior is different in PowerPoint 97. In PowerPoint 97 Setup, Clip
Art is selected by default when you choose a Custom installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To install clip art, run a maintenance mode installation of PowerPoint for
Windows 95 and select Clip Art. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Run the PowerPoint 7.0 Setup.

2. Click Add/Remove.

3. Highlight Shared Applications and click Change Option.

4. Select the Clip Art check box.

5. Click OK, click Continue, and allow Setup to run to completion.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. The Custom installation option allows you to choose
whether to install each component of the program. In the Typical installation
mode, Clip Art is selected by default because it assumes most users want some
clip art.
