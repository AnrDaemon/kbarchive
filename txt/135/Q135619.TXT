SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to reference a property of a class from another
property of a class within the same class definition. This would be useful when
performing calculations involving other properties of the same class.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code demonstrates the correct way to reference a property within
its class definition:

      x=CreateObject("Test")
    
      DEFINE CLASS Test AS Custom
          pnVar = 200
          nNewVar = THIS.pnVar + 200
      ENDDEFINE

You can refresh the nNewVar property in this example once the class is
instantiated by reassigning the value pnVar+200 to TEST.nNewVar as follows:

      TEST.nNewVar=TEST.pnVar + 200
