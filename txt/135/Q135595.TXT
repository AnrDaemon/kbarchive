-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, versions 3.11, 3.11a, 3.11b 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The IPCONFIG.EXE utility included with Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 does not display the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the
host computer if the domain name is assigned through DHCP. If the domain name is
assigned manually, IPCONFIG correctly reports the FQDN.

The version of IPCONFIG supplied with Windows NT does report the domain name.

Sample output from IPCONFIG when run on Windows for Workgroups 3.11 DHCP client:

    Host Name . . . . . . . . . : ENG-LAB041 (should be
                                 ENG-LAB041.NETLAB.DOM in this example)
   DNS Servers . . . . . . . . : 157.55.136.218
                                 157.55.136.219
                                 157.55.136.220
   Node Type . . . . . . . . . : Mixed
   NetBIOS Scope ID. . . . . . :
   IP Routing Enabled. . . . . : No
   WINS Proxy Enabled. . . . . : No
   NetBIOS Resolution uses DNS : No

CAUSE
=====

IPCONFIG.EXE does not read the domain name from the DHCP.BIN file. The domain
name is read only from SYSTEM.INI.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32 for Windows for
Workgroups versions 3.11, 3.11a, and 3.11b. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
