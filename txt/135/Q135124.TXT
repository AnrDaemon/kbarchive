======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use hot keys during remote control of a client from Systems Management
Server Administrator, the hot keys do not work on the client.


CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server Administrator is not passing the hot keys along to the
remote control client.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to Systems Management Server version 1.1.

NOTE: The Quick Windows Viewer window has a new check box in the window caption
bar that makes selecting this option easier.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Passing Regular Keystrokes to a Client
--------------------------------------

When the Quick Windows Viewer window is active, your keystrokes are passed to the
client computer running Windows versions 3.1 or 3.11. The client processes these
keystrokes as if you are typing them on the client's keyboard.

Passing System Keystrokes to a Client
-------------------------------------

To allow system keystrokes to be passed through to the remote control client,
choose the System Key Pass Through option in the control parameters. By default,
the following keystrokes are not passed:

 - CTRL+ALT+DELETE

 - CTRL+ESC

 - ALT+TAB

 - Special hot key sequences you define using the Quick Windows Viewer control
   menu window.

On clients running MS-DOS, the ALT key is not passed if Keyboard Stuffing is set
to Interrupt Driven.

For more information on Remote Control, see the section titled Remote
Troubleshooting Utilities in the Systems Management Server Administrators Guide,
chapter 15.
