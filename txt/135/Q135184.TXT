The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running ARCsolo version 3.01 or 3.02 by Cheyenne Software in
Windows 95, the listing of network drives mapped to Microsoft servers (Windows
for Workgroups, LAN Manager, Windows NT, or Windows 95 servers) does not appear
as it does in Windows 3.1.

CAUSE
=====

ARCsolo relies on entries in the System.ini file that are not present in Windows
95.

RESOLUTION
==========

Place the following entry in the [boot] section of the System.ini file, and then
restart Windows 95:

   " network.drv=commctrl.dll " (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

ARCsolo reads the "network.drv=" entry to determine which DLL to load. If the
entry is not present, the attempt fails and the network drive listing is not
correct. Any DLL will work for this entry; Commctrl.dll is simply a usable
example.
