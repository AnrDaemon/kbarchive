SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the SEEK command and there are trailing spaces in the seek key, the
seek fails if you previously used this command:

   SET COLLATE TO "machine"

However, the seek succeeds if you previously used this command:

      SET COLLATE TO "general"

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the trailing spaces from the seek key.

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Code to Reproduce Problem
-------------------------

   * Begin program
   * This program uses Customer.dbf found in the \Samples\Data subdirectory.
   * It is assumed that you have installed the sample data to the
   * default directory under the main VFP directory.

   CLEAR
   CD SYS(2004) + "\samples\data"
   USE customer IN 0
   SET COLLATE TO "machine"
   DO theprog
   SELECT classd1
   USE

   SET COLLATE TO "general"
   DO theprog

   SELECT classd1
   USE
   SELECT customer
   USE

   PROCEDURE theprog

   * This is just a simple SELECT statement to create a cursor to use
   * for this example. This SELECT creates a small set of records
   * from the Customer table and then creates a tag where the key is
   * concatenation of several fields.

      SELECT cust_id,company,contact,phone,SUBSTR(contact,1,1) ;
      AS flag,' ' AS done;
         FROM customer ;
         WHERE SUBSTR(contact,1,1)$"AI" ;
         INTO CURSOR classd1
      INDEX ON done + cust_id + flag TAG dcust

   * Now that the cursor is created, seek a record that you know is in
   * the new set of records. Then report the collation sequence
   * and the results of the seek.

      SEEK " LAMAI A "

   * Print the collation sequence that is in effect. Then if you are at
   * the end of file marker, you know the record was not found; in which case,
   * print the word "not." If not at EOF, you found the record, so print
   * "found."

      ?"With the collation sequence set to " + SET("collate");
       + " the record was " + IIF( EOF(),"not ","") + "found"

   * End Program
