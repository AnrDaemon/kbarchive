KEYWORDS:win95

SYMPTOMS
========

Device Manager displays a PCI-to-ISA bridge with an exclamation point in a
yellow circle, indicating that there is a resource conflict.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is typically caused by a Plug and Play BIOS that reports both a
PCI and an ISA bus. There is no actual conflict.

RESOLUTION
==========

You may want to contact your hardware manufacturer to inquire about obtaining an
updated Plug and Play BIOS that reports only a PCI bus, which in turn reports
the ISA bus.
