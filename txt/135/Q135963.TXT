PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 and DriveSpace 3 and then
re-install Windows 95, you cannot create a DriveSpace 3-compatible startup disk.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 Setup replaces the Msdos.inf and Layout.inf files used to create the
startup disk with the original versions of the files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To update the required files, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
   System Tools, and then click DriveSpace.

2. Click an uncompressed drive, and then click Create Empty on the Advanced
   menu.

3. In the Using box, enter "1" (without the quotation marks) and then click
   Start. The "1" indicates the size in megabytes for the new compressed drive.

4. When you are prompted to update the current startup disk, click Yes.

To delete the new compressed drive, follow these steps:

1. Click the new compressed drive in DriveSpace, and then click Delete on the
   Advanced menu.

2. Click Yes, and then OK, to confirm that you want to delete the drive.

3. Close DriveSpace.

STATUS
======

researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
