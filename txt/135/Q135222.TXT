TITLE   :IRQ and DMA Resources Not Listed for ECP Port
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view an ECP port in Device Manager, the only resource listed for the
port may be the I/O resource. There may not be IRQ or DMA resources listed.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 cannot detect the IRQ and DMA usage on some ECP ports. When this
occurs, Device Manager reports an ECP port with no IRQ or DMA resources, and the
port is treated as an ordinary LPT port.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use the ECP features of the port, change the port's configuration in Device
Manager to use the correct IRQ and DMA resources.
