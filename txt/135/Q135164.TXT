 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Dial-Up Networking connection using the SLIP (Serial Line
Internet Protocol) server type with an Internet service provider, Ping may
function correctly, but other programs (such as a Web browser) may not.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you select the wrong IP Header Compression setting.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use these steps to change the IP Header Compression setting:

1. Open the properties for the Dial-Up Networking connectoid.

2. Click Server Type.

3. Click TCP/IP Settings.

4. Click the Use IP Header Compression check box.

5. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you choose the wrong IP Header Compression setting, IP and User Datagram
Protocol (UDP) programs (such as Ping) may operate normally, but TCP-based
programs will not work. The IP Header Compression setting must be changed.
