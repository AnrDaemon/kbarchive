TITLE   :Zenith ZDS 1762 Laptop Computer Hangs at Startup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows 95 on a Zenith ZDS 1762 laptop computer, the computer may
stop responding (hang) while Windows 95 is processing the Config.sys file.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if Pcenable.exe (Zenith's PCMCIA driver) is loaded before
Mztinit.sys (Zenith's Mozart sound system driver) in the Config.sys file. When
this occurs, Pcenable.exe installs a hook for IRQ 7, which Mztinit.sys also
tries to use.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the Config.sys file. Move the
"device=mztinit.sys" line so that it is before any PCMCIA drivers. After you
make this change, save and then close the Config.sys file, and then restart your
computer.
