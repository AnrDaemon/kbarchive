TITLE   :"Windows Protection Error" on NEC Powermate 466
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start Windows 95 for the first time after Setup finishes, you
may receive the following error message:

   Windows Protection Error

If you restart Windows 95 in Safe mode, you see an incorrect display device
listed in Device Manager.

CAUSE
=====

Early versions of the NEC Powermate 466 Plug and Play BIOS do not report the
display type correctly.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, restart Windows 95 using the Command Prompt Only
option on the Startup menu. Run Setup again, with the following command:

   setup /p i

This command forces Setup to ignore the computer's Plug and Play BIOS.

You may also want to contact NEC to inquire about obtaining an updated BIOS that
resolves this problem.
