TITLE   :Network Tool Cannot Copy Files on RPL Computers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the Network tool in Control Panel to add network components,
you may receive an error message stating that files cannot be copied.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur on Remote Program Loader (RPL) computers. The problem
occurs because the Network tool tries to copy files to drive A, which usually
does not exist on RPL computers once Windows 95 is running.

RESOLUTION
==========

Click Skip when you receive the error message. The files are already located in
the correct places for an RPL computer, and there is no need to copy them again.
Clicking Skip should result in a correct configuration.

Additional query words: diskless
