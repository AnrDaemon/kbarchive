======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

MFC provides a function called GetCurrentMessage that returns a pointer to a MSG
structure encapsulating the current message being processed. The MSG structure
contains a member variable (pt), of type POINT that contains incorrect values.

CAUSE
=====

The GetCurrentMessage function fills in the POINT structure with the following
line of code:

      *((DWORD*)&pThreadState->m_lastSentMsg.pt) = ::GetMessagePos();

This code was correct in the 16-bit version of Visual C++ because a POINT
structure was made up of two intergers (int) that were each 16-bits. Thus the
size of a POINT was the same as a DWORD.

However, in the 32-bit version of Windows and of the Visual C++ compiler, a POINT
structure is made up of two LONGs, each 32-bits, so the total size of a POINT is
now 64-bits and the above assignment is not valid.

RESOLUTION
==========

To obtain the correct value for the point in the current MSG you can use MFC's
overridden CPoint constructor which takes a DWORD as an argument. For example:

      CPoint pt(::GetMessagePos());
      // Now pt has the correct values

Please note that because the GetCurrentMessage function returns a pointer to a
'const' MSG structure, you can't change the pt member of the message structure.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 2.2.
