TITLE   :PRB: Decimals Don't Display Properly in Grid
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Numbers displayed in a grid show four decimal places instead of two.

CAUSE
=====

The Grid.Column.Sparse property is not set to false, and there is no InputMask
property defined for the Textbox object of the grid.

RESOLUTION
==========

For the column that is used to display the numeric data, set the Sparse property
to false, and enter a valid input mask for the Textbox object. Note that setting
the Sparse property to false can result in some performance degradation.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Numeric fields in a table can have two to nine decimal places. Currency fields
have an automatic default of four decimal places. When displaying any numeric or
currency information in a grid, it is necessary to set two properties of the
grid to limit the display to two and only two decimal places.

The first property is the Sparse value. By default, the Sparse property is set to
true. According to the information in the Visual FoxPro Help file, the Sparse
property specifies whether the CurrentControl property affects all or only the
active cell in a Column object.

When the Sparse property is set to true, only the column's active cell uses the
CurrentControl property setting to accept and display data. The other cells use
the default text box. If the Sparse property is set to false, all cells in the
Column object will use the CurrentControl property setting to display data.

The second property that must be set is the InputMask, which governs how data is
entered and displayed in a control. A grid is a combination of several different
objects including a text box, so it is necessary to apply some kind of an input
mask to the grid text box control. In this situation, a valid input mask would
consist of the following:

   999,999,999.99

Setting both of these properties allows the desired level of control when
displaying numeric data in a grid. The setting of the DECIMALS value, such as
SET DECIMALS TO 2, has no effect on the data displayed in the grid.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add the Orders table to the form's data environment.

3. Drag the table from the data environment to the form. A grid will
   automatically be created.

4. Run the form.

The data shown in the Order_amt field will display data with four decimal places.
Following the steps outlined in this article will result in the data being
displayed with two decimal places.
