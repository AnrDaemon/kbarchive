TITLE   :FIX: Rebuilding .CLW File Does Not Restore Link to ODL File
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::2.0,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbMFC kbVC200bug kbVC210 kbVC220fix kbClassWizard kbGrpDSTools kbNoUpdatekbbug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 2.0, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A project's Object Description Language (ODL) file is not updated when new
automation properties and methods are added using ClassWizard. The project's
ClassWizard (.clw) file has been deleted and rebuilt prior to the occurrence of
this behavior. All properties and methods added before the rebuilding of the
ClassWizard file are still correctly listed in the ODL file.

CAUSE
=====

When the .clw file is rebuilt by the development environment, the ODLFile=
keyword line is not added to the new file.

RESOLUTION
==========

The ODLFile= entry must be manually added to the .clw file so that ClassWizard
can add properties and methods to the ODL file. The ODLFile= entry can be added
by using the development environment editor or Notepad.

Manually adding the ODLFile= entry will not automatically update the ODL file to
bring it back in synch with ClassWizard. Any properties and methods that were
added via ClassWizard while the ODLFile= entry was missing from the .clw file
must be either manually added to the ODL file or removed and then added again by
using the ClassWizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 2.2 for
Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An example of the ODLFile= line can be found in the .clw file provided with the
AutoClik sample. In this sample, the [General Info] section of the Autoclik.clw
file includes the following line:

      ODLFile=autoclik.odl

ClassWizard uses this reference to a specific ODL to determine the file to update
when new properties and methods are added. When the .clw file is rebuilt using
the ClassWizard option from the development environment Resource Editor, the
ODLFile= reference line is not included in the newly built .clw file. After the
rebuild, ClassWizard does not issue a warning when adding new properties and
methods to the new .clw file even though the changes are not reflected in the
ODL file.

This problem does not appear in Visual C++ version 4.0. Visual C++ 4.0 does not
use a keyword in the .clw file to keep track of the name of the ODL file.
