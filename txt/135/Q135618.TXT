KEYWORDS:kbtool kbvfp kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a view created in the following manner, you do not see a crosstab
view. This occurs when you create a local view through the View Designer, select
three columns to include in the view (a descriptive field, date field, and
amount field), and select the Crosstab option.

When you run the view, either from the Designer or the Project Manager, you don't
see a crosstab view of the cursor. Instead, you see a standard browse of the
cursor. The View Designer does not process the crosstab correctly. In addition,
the crosstab check box is no longer selected when you modify the view.

WORKAROUND
==========

The SQL code created by the View Designer is reliable and functions as expected
if it is run from a program or a procedure. Therefore, you can construct the
crosstab through the View Designer; then save the SQL code in a procedure or
program, and run that procedure or program to see the results of the crosstab.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
