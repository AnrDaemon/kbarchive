The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On page 313 of version 3.2 or page 315 of version 3.5 Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks "Administrator's Guide," the following is incorrectly stated:

   If there is no new mail, the Errorlevel is set to 0 by the New Mail utility;
   any other value is an error.

It should read:

   If there is new mail, Errorlevel is set to 0 by the New Mail utility;
   otherwise it is set to 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following can be added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT batch file or the Novell login
script to start the Mail program automatically when there is new mail:

   NEWMAIL mailbox
   If Errorlevel 1 goto END
   MAIL mailbox -ppassword
   :END

Additional query words: 3.20 3.50
