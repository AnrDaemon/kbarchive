TITLE   :PRB: Visual C++ Link Error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to build a dynamic link library (DLL) (Hello.dll or another .dll
file) using Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, and following the instructions in the
Professional Features Guide on page 188. You could receive the following
errors:

   Linking ..
   Linking error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol "__PutStr"
   WinRel/YourDll.dll ; error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals Error executing
   link.exe

CAUSE
=====

The problem is that you have not set the Calling Convention to _fastcall. It may
still be set to __cdedl*.

In the Project Settings of Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, if you do not set the
C/C++ Tabs Category "Code Generation" Calling Convention: to _fastcall You will
receive these errors. This is covered on page 188 in the "To establish project
settings" section.

NOTE: In the Project Settings Dialog Box, you can give the setting for either or
both projects (Win32 Debug or the Win32 Release). To set the settings for both,
select one and drag to highlight all others under the Settings For: area of the
Project Settings.
