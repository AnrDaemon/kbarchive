======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The default "Tape Name" text generated for a tape by Windows NT Backup
(NTBACKUP.EXE) contains an incorrect date if the backup is started close to
midnight on a computer in a southern hemisphere time zone with the
"Automatically Adjust for Daylight Savings Time" option selected.

If Daylight Saving is in effect and the backup is started between 11:00 pm and
midnight, Tape Name shows the following day's date.

If Daylight Saving is in NOT effect and the backup is started between midnight
and 1:00 am, Tape Name shows the previous day's date.

CAUSE
=====

NTBACKUP.EXE does not take the computer's configured time zone into
consideration.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Windows NT version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
