SUMMARY
=======

When a distribution list is created, the administrator can assign an owner. The
owner can be any Microsoft Exchange user or custom recipient. The Owner field is
currently used only for informational purposes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Being the owner of a distribution list does not automatically imply the ability
to manage the membership of the distribution list. To allow a user to manage the
membership of a distribution list, the Administrator must grant user permission
on the distribution list object to that user's Windows NT account. Hence, even
though the owner can be a Microsoft Exchange user or a custom recipient, only
Microsoft Exchange users can modify a distribution list.

Although the owner field is currently strictly informational, it could be used
for various purposes. For example, a custom Exchange form could be developed to
automate the modification of distribution lists. The Exchange form could
automatically send the modification request to the owner of the distribution
list, who could then take action on it.
