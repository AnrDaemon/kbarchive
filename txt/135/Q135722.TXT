SUMMARY
=======

FTP servers running Windows NT 3.5 that are configured to allow anonymous
connections allow users from trusted domains to logon to an FTP server. In
Windows NT 3.51, non-anonymous FTP connections from trusted domains fail.

When non-anonymous FTP connections from trusted domains fail, the following error
message appears:

   user cannot login, login failed


RESOLUTION
==========

When you log on to an FTP server with an account from a trusted domain, logon as
Domain\User, where Domain is the Windows NT domain that has your user account
and User is your Windows NT domain logon name.

This change was made in Windows NT 3.51 to enhance security.
