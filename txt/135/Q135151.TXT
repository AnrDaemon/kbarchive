TITLE   :PCMCIA Devices Not Activated When Resuming Dell Latitude XP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Suspend command on a Dell Latitude XP laptop computer connected
to a port replicator, PCMCIA devices may not reactivate when you resume the
system.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the computer contains a BIOS version of A05 or
earlier. BIOS versions A05 and earlier do not send an Advanced Power Management
(APM) resume event to reenumerate PCMCIA devices when the computer is connected
to a port replicator.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, do not use the Suspend command when the computer is
connected to a port replicator.

To resolve the problem, please contact Dell Technical Support to inquire about
obtaining an updated BIOS.
