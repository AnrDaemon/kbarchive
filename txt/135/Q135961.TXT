TITLE   :Slow Performance After Installing Microsoft Plus!
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Plus! and select a desktop theme, system performance
may appear to be slower. For example, Start menus may take longer to open,
full-window dragging may produce ghost images, and screen updates may take
longer. In addition, X-Windows-based programs may leave window trails.

CAUSE
=====

Using a desktop theme places higher processing demands on the video adapter and
system CPU.

RESOLUTION
==========

To permanently resolve this problem, use a high-performance video adapter with a
minimum of 2 MB of video ram, and upgrade to a higher-performance CPU to
increase overall system performance.

As a temporary workaround, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click an empty area of the desktop, and then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

2. On the Plus! tab, click the Show Window Contents While Dragging check box to
   clear it.

3. Click the "Show icons in all possible colors" check box to clear it.

4. Click the "Stretch desktop wallpaper to fit the screen" check box to clear
   it.

5. Click OK.
