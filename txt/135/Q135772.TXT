TITLE   :TMP Files Left After Deinstall of SMS Admin UI Tool
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup kbsmsAdmin kbsmsUtil smsadmin smssetup smsutil

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you use Systems Management Server Setup to deinstall the SMS Administrator
from a computer running Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 or 3.5, Setup fails
to remove two .TMP files in the root directory. The two files are:

     Name        Size
   --------------------
   _@x.TMP    1,241,520
   _@x.TMP      219,136

NOTE: x represents the increment of temp files created.

CAUSE
=====

These files are not deleted because they are not noted in the following registry
location:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   \System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\FileRenameOperations

This registry entry is blank after the deinstall completes. Windows NT looks in
this location for filenames to be deleted upon system startup. Because there
were no entries present, no files were deleted.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually delete the files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
