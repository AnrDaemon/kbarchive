SYMPTOMS
========

After you compress a drive with DriveSpace 3, the drive's properties may
indicate that the amount of space used on the drive has increased, even though
no new files were added.

CAUSE
=====

When you compress a drive with DriveSpace 3, a larger cluster size is used on
the drive, and small files appear to use up more space than on a drive with
smaller clusters. However, DriveSpace 3 uses an efficient allocation method that
actually frees up wasted space within clusters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DriveSpace 3 uses 32K clusters. Most host drives less than 1 gigabyte in size
use clusters smaller than 32K.
