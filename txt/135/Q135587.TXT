PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11; :3.11,3.11a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, versions 3.11, 3.11a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your HOSTS file contains incorrect IP address syntax and you PING the host
computer by name, a broadcast storm can occur. You may receive several ICMP echo
replies. An example of an incorrect IP address syntax is as follows:

   157.54..65.212 myhosts

CAUSE
=====

Given the above example, when you PING myhosts, TCP/IP-32 3.11a sends ICMP echo
requests to the address of 255.255.255.255 (broadcast).

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32 for Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11a. This problem was corrected in TCP/IP-32 for Windows
for Workgroups version 3.11b.
