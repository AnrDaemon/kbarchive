PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The text string on the Status Bar does not show the correct object StatusBarText
property with the SetFocus method.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can substitute KEYBOARD '{TAB}' for the line thisform.text1.setfocus as many
times as necessary to move to the desired object.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a form with three text boxes and one command button.

2. Edit the property of each of the text boxes and the command button with a
   unique text string for the StatusBarText property.

3. In the Click event procedure of the command button, enter this code:

      THISFORM.TEXT1.SETFOCUS
      THISFORM.REFRESH

4. Run your form.

You will observe that you can press the TAB key or click to and from any object
on the form, and you will see the correct text on the Status Bar for the object
that has the focus.

However, if you click the command button, the pointer moves to the Text1 object,
but you will see that the text on the Status Bar is from the property of the
command button and not the current object (Text1).
