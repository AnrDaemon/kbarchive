TITLE   :IPINFO.INF Values Ignored During Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You configure IPINFO.INF with TCP/IP address and subnet mask values, but Setup
ignores them and you have to enter them manually in the TCP/IP configuration
dialog box after TCP/IP is installed.

This problem occurs when you install TCP/IP using the unattended setup feature of
Windows NT Setup or Computer Profile Setup (CPS) and you set the [DefaultIPInfo]
section of IPINFO.INF to include values for DefaultGateway, Number of IP
Addresses, IP Address, and Subnet Mask.

NOTE: The IPINFO.INF file allows network administrators to provide smart defaults
for TCP/IP configuration parameters. By modifying this template file, an
administrator can distribute the Windows NT TCP/IP software over the network or
on floppy disks to users with some smart default configuration parameters. Users
may modify these values when installing TCP/IP, however, the default values are
automatically filled in for them.

CAUSE
=====

The OEMNXPTC.INF does not read the IPINFO.INF file correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT version 3.51.

To work around this problem:


 - If you are attempting to automate TCP/IP installation during Windows NT 3.5
   Setup, copy the OEMNXPTC.INF file from Windows NT 3.51 to your Windows NT 3.5
   I386 directory. If you do not have Windows NT 3.51, contact Microsoft Product
   Support Services to obtain OEMNXPTC.INF.

 - If you are attempting to install TCP/IP after Windows NT 3.5 is installed,
   copy the OEMNXPTC.INF file from Windows NT 3.51 to the %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32
   directory of the Windows NT 3.5 installation.
