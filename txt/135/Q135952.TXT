SYMPTOMS
========

In System Agent, the Last Result column for a ScanDisk task may report "Check
was stopped because of an error." However, the Scandisk.log file does not list
any errors, and you do not encounter any errors if you run ScanDisk manually.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may be caused by an invalid drive in ScanDisk's DrivesToCheck
registry setting. The DrivesToCheck setting can become invalid if a drive that
existed when the ScanDisk task was created is subsequently removed. For example,
this can occur when you remove a PCMCIA drive, uncompress or unmount a
compressed drive, or remove a laptop computer from its docking station.

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete the existing ScanDisk task and schedule a new task. Make sure to check
the settings for the task to see that they meet your requirements.

If you use a docking station or some other form of removable drive on a regular
basis, you may want to schedule separate ScanDisk tasks for the permanent and
removable drives. Because only one instance of ScanDisk can run at a time, make
sure to schedule the tasks so that they do not overlap.
