======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 hangs when you attempt to logon to a remote
domain or connect to a shared resource on a remote network you have connected to
using Remote Access Services (RAS).

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur on a laptop computer that is not installed in its docking
station that contains a network interface card (NIC) or on a computer that is
configured to use a NIC that is not physically connected to a network.

In these cases, your computer has both NIC and RAS drivers installed. If your
default protocol is bound to the NIC, your computer hangs when it attempts to
access the remote network.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the NetBEUI protocol that is bound to the RAS driver as the default
protocol. To do this:

1. Run Network Setup in the Network group.

2. Choose the Drivers button.

3. In the Network Drivers dialog, select the Microsoft NetBEUI protocol entry
   that is listed under the Remote Access Service [NDIS3] driver.

4. Choose the Set As Default Protocol button.
