-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

The ACTIVATE WINDOW command does not work with toolbars. This command:

      ACTIVATE WINDOW "Standard"

results in thie following error message:

   Window "STANDARD" has not been defined

None of the toolbars can be activated with the ACTIVATE WINDOW command.

RESOLUTION
==========

If it is necessary to call toolbars programmatically, use the KEYBOARD command:

      KEYBOARD '{ALT+V}ts{SPACEBAR}{ENTER}'

To determine the exact syntax for a particular toolbar, click Macros on the
Program menu and select Record.

Please note that Visual FoxPro's macro recorder does not record movements of the
mouse; therefore, you need to use the keyboard to created the macro.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Once a toolbar is open, the HIDE WINDOW, SHOW WINDOW, and ACTIVATE WINDOW
commands will work. This is because the toolbar now exists in memory.
