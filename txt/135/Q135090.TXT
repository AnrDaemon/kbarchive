TITLE   :Shared Program Groups are Not Removed During PGC Deinstallation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


After you run the Program Group Control (PGC) command APPCTL16 /DEINSTALL on a
Windows 95 client, the registry entries of shared application groups are
cleared, but the groups themselves are not deinstalled.


CAUSE
=====

The PGC deinstall process does not work reliably on Windows 95, and therefore
does not always remove shared program groups.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
