TITLE   :SNA Server DLC Outage Codes Should be Logged in Hex.
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an SNA Server connection failure occurs, SNA Server logs Event 23 in the
Windows NT application event log and indicates the error code returned by the
SNA Server link service in the Qualifier field. For example:

   Event ID: 23
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: Connection <connection> using Link Service <link>
   failed
   Qualifier = 00xx

The "xx" value in the Qualifier field indicates the "outage code", which is
logged in hex format, such as "00AE". The meaning of these hex-formatted outage
codes are documented in the SNA Server Reference Guide under Event 23, as well
as in the SNA Server Device Interface Specification in Section 3.4.

When enabling SNA Server Data Link Control (DLC) tracing using the SNATRACE
program (on either the SNA Server service, or a link service), the
<snaroot>\traces\NODEMSG?.TRC message trace file will also log the outage
code. However, the outage code logged in the DLC message trace is logged in
decimal, which can cause confusion. For example:

   | DLC  ---------------------------------------------- 14:15:37.37
   | DLC  05160000->01020100 DLCST OUTG
   | DLC                     Outage:174 UPTYPE:0 UPCNTR:0 COUNT:0
   | DLC
   | DLC  ---- Header  at address 00CF478C, 0 elements ----
   | DLC  18110000 00000000 00000000 0100C600     <..............F.>

In the above case, the outage code of 174 decimal is equivalent to 0xAE hex.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server DLC message tracing logs outage codes in decimal.

RESOLUTION
==========

When interpreting an SNA Server DLC message trace outage message, the outage
code should be converted to hex in order to locate the proper error listed in
the SNA Server Reference Guide.

Microsoft has updated the file SNATRCSN.DLL to correct this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
