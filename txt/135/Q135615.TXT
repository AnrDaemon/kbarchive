TITLE   :PRB: Setup Fails If Too Much Copyright Information Is Entered
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Step 4 of the Setup Wizard has an edit region to input Copyright information. If
the information entered in this region exceeds 214 characters in length, various
errors occur when you run Setup on disk 1.

CAUSE
=====

The Copyright edit region of Step 4 of the Setup Wizard contains more than 214
characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

Keep the Copyright information to 214 or less characters in length.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Depending on the amount of characters actually entered, Setup fails in different
ways. If the length entered is 215, Setup runs up through the Confirmation of
Name & Organization. Once that is confirmed, Setup displays a message window
stating, "Setup was not completed successfully" and then exits.

If the length entered is between 216 and 255 characters, Setup immediately
presents a window stating "Setup was not completed successfully" and then
exits.

If the length exceeds 255 characters, Setup starts and immediately gives the
following two error messages and then exits:

   Error One:

   Window Title: Error in Table Syntax - Top Level
   Message Text: Bad Setup Version Field.

   Error Two:

   Window Title: Setup Message
   Message Text: Processing Top Level Information Field.
