TITLE   :PC DB: LISTUSER Version 2.1 Displays Unrecognizable Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you review the contents of the output generated by LISTUSER.EXE version
2.1, unrecognizable ASCII characters are displayed at the end of file. This
problem applies to postoffices that have over 475 users defined that includes
active and deleted users.


RESOLUTION
==========

Update to the latest version of LISTUSER.EXE. For more information about the
LISTUSER.EXE utility and how to obtain it, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q99419 PC DB: Database Maintenance Utilities (Complete)


When you update to the latest version of LISTUSER.EXE, and it does not resolve
your problem, one or more files on the Microsoft Mail postoffice may be corrupt.
You can determine corruption of files by checking the file sizes.

If any of the following calculations results in a remainder, the corresponding
file is corrupt:

NOTE: All three access files should equal the same whole number.

   (size of ACCESS.GLB) / 586
   (size of ACCESS2.GLB) / 69
   (size of ACCESS3.GLB) / 512

If corruption exists with any of the three Access files, restore from backup. The
complete list of files to restore is:

 - ACCESS.GLB

 - ACCESS2.GLB

 - ACCESS3.GLB

 - ADMIN.NME

 - ADMINSHD.NME

 - ADMIN.GRP

 - ADMINSHD.GRP

Before you restore the files, check the ADMIN.NME, ADMINSHD.NME, ADMIN.GRP, and
ADMINSHD.GRP files for corruption. The ADMIN.NME and ADMINSHD.NME files should
be divisible by 45 and should be the same size and date. The ADMIN.GRP and
ADMINSHD.GRP files should be the same size and date stamp. To check the
ADMIN.GRP and ADMINSHD.GRP for corruption, subtract 8 prior to dividing by 8.
All files should come out to whole numbers.

All the files should be restored from the most recent valid backup. If users have
been added to the mail system since the last backup, these users will have to be
redefined after the restoration.

For Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation users:

   You should make an archive of your mail folders and Inbox prior to restoring
   the files that can be unarchived upon recreation of the mailbox.

For Mail for Windows users:

   You should make a backup of your MMF file prior to restoring the files that
   can be re-imported (from the File menu, choose Import Folders) upon
   recreation of your mailbox.
