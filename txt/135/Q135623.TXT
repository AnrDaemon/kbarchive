======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The table on Page 303 in the Developer's Guide for "Using Form Graphics to
Display Information" should have Method as the first column's title instead of
Property.

Above the table, the text states, "You can graphically display information on a
form by using the following form methods." Also, the descriptions of the table
items are actions, not properties of an object.

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

Additional query words: 3.00 docerr VFoxWin 5.00
