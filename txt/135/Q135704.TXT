======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the MSMAPI.VBX control to logon Mail for PC Networks, you can
suppress the default logon dialog box by setting the following:

 - The LogonUI property of MapiSession to false.

 - The Username property to a valid mailbox.

 - The Password to the mailbox's password.

However, when the password property is null, the following error will occur:

   2003 (Login Failure)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Make sure that the entries for the user's name and password are present in the
MSMAIL.INI.

NOTE: The Password entry does not need any characters after it.

   [Microsoft Mail]
   Login=username
   Password=

The code below duplicates the situation when the error occurs with the Admin
mailbox and a blank password.

      myform.MapiSess.UserName = "admin"
      myform.MapiSess.Password = ""
      myform.MapiSess.NewSession = True
      myform.MapiSess.LogonUI = False
      myform.MapiSess.Action = SESSION_SIGNON

Unfortunately, a null password can be used only if there is an existing session
or the LogonUI property is set to True. If there is an existing session, you can
pass nulls for both the name and password, and you will be returned a handle to
the existing session. If there is no existing session, and you set LogonUI
property to true, MAPILogon will generate the standard Sign-In dialog box.
