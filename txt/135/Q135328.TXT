PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When designing a form in Visual FoxPro, you can move the form to any part of the
screen by changing the Top or Left property to a number greater than zero. If
the form is changed from its default position of the upper-left corner using
this method, the user is supposed to be able to return the form to its original
position by choosing the Top and/or Left property, clicking the secondary mouse
button, and clicking the Reset to Default option. The problem is that if you
choose the Reset to Default option, a negative number appears in the property
box and the form is moved past the upper-left corner and off the screen.

There is no way to move the form back to the original default position while
modifying it unless zero is typed into the Top and/or Left property box. If the
form is run while in this position, it returns to the original default position
when shown on the desktop. Modifying the form after running it shows the form
returned to its original default position.

WORKAROUND
==========

Type zero in the Top property of the form in the form's properties box. This
will move the form back to its original position.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a form in Visual FoxPro.

2. In the properties box, click the Layout tab, and type 100 in the Top property
   box. The form will move down from the top of the screen after pressing ENTER
   to accept the number.

3. Click the secondary mouse button while the pointer is resting on the Top
   property.

4. Click the Reset to Default option in the popup box.

5. Note that the number is reset to a negative number, and the form is
   positioned off the screen.

6. Type 0 in the Top property box, and watch the form return to the upper-left
   corner.
