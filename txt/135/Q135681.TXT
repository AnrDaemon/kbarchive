======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT 4.0 Printers Folder and Windows NT 3.51 Print Manager does not list
Multi Purpose(MP) Tray as an available paper source for the HP 4 series
printers. Windows NT 3.5 has this option.

CAUSE
=====

The paper tray names were changed in Windows NT 3.51 to provide a consistent
interface between Windows NT and Windows 95.


RESOLUTION
==========

To print to the MP tray on an HP 4 printer, choose Upper Paper Tray as the
source. The output will be correctly routed to the MP tray.

Additional query words: prodnt 4m plus hp4 4mp
