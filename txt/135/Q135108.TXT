======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On page 2 under the "Installing Prerequisite Software" section of the
"Administrator's Guide" for the Multitasking MTA for Windows NT (NT MMTA), it
incorrectly states the following:

   Set up the computer with Windows NT Node, version 3.5, or Windows NT Server,
   version 3.5.

Page 1 of the "Administrator's Guide" indicates that a node supporting Windows NT
Server, version 3.51 or later is required. This is the correct prerequisite to
run the NT MMTA.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Multitasking MTA for Windows NT Server is only supported on Microsoft
Windows NT Server version 3.51. It will not work on Microsoft Windows NT
Workstation, nor is it supported.

Additional query words: 3.50
