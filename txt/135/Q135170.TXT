SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running WordPad, you may see available alternate font characters
sets (such as Turkish or Cyrillic), but you may not be able to use them. For
example, after you select Times New Roman (Turkish), the font reverts to Times
New Roman (Western) as soon as you click the document area.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you have installed multiple language support, but
have not installed the matching keyboard layout.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Keyboard tool in Control Panel to install the keyboard layout
corresponding to the character set you want to use.
