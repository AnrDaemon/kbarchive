-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a diskless remoteboot workstation you cannot regain access to
your workstation after this network error appears:

   Net 815: Network name was deleted.

This symptom occurs when the following conditions apply:

 - Your workstation boots from a Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 remoteboot server.

 - Your workstation is running LAN Manager for MS-DOS, version 2.2c

 - Your remoteboot server has the AutoDisconnect parameter set to -1.

 - Your workstation is booted but not used for a long time (for example,
   overnight).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set the remoteboot server's Autodisconnect
parameter to a smaller value, such as 15 minutes (the default) or 480 minutes (8
hours).


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
