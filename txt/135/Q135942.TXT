SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows 95 DriveSpace program to uncompress a drive, the
program prompts you whether you want to uncompress the drive and remove the
compression driver from memory. After the drive is uncompressed, the
Dblspace.bin file may remain resident in conventional memory and the
Dblspace.ini file may remain on drive C.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 is installed on a drive other than drive C, and you are using the
uncompress feature from the Windows 95 drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove the Dblspace.bin file from conventional memory and the Dblspace.ini
file from drive C, use one of the following methods:

 - Delete all reference to DoubleSpace from drive C by typing the following
   command at the MS-DOS prompt:

   " Deltree dblspace.* " (without the quotation marks)

   -or-

 - Use the Windows 95 protect mode Drivespace program to uncompress the drive.
