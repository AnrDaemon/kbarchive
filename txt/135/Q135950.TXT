======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose to install Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 in a custom folder,
only a portion of the Microsoft Plus! files are placed in that folder. Many of
the files are placed in the Program Files\Plus! folder.

CAUSE
=====

You can specify a custom folder for the Microsoft Plus! files early in the Setup
process. If you do not specify a custom folder, the Microsoft Plus! files are
installed in the Program Files\Plus! folder.

You can also specify a custom folder for each of the following components by
clicking the Change Folder button for each component:

 - System Agent

 - Internet Tools

 - Desktop Themes

 - 3D Pinball

If you change the folder for a component, only that component is affected. Even
if you change the folder for all four components, several files are installed in
the Program Files\Plus! folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run Microsoft Plus! Setup again and choose the Remove All option. Then, run
Setup again and specify a custom folder the first time you are offered the
opportunity to do so.
