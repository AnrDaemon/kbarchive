======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the defined Smarthost for the SMTP Gateway recognizes problems with mail
transfer or with delivering messages, a mail warning or status report will be
sent to the Postmaster account of the Microsoft Mail system.

If no Postmaster account is present, the address gets replaced with chevrons
(<>) so that the message gets delivered to the Admin account on the
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice, instead of being bounced between
systems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By creating a Postmaster account on the Microsoft Mail system, these messages
will be delivered to that account for observation. These messages can then be
used to help determine the cause of problems with the message transfer between
systems.


Additional query words: 3.00 failure error report
