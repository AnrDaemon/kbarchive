The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Plus!, you may receive one of the following error
messages:

   - Setup Error 907
   Object 140
   Your Setup files may be damaged. Try restarting the Setup Program.

   - Setup Error 907
   Object 240
   Your Setup files may be damaged. Try restarting the Setup Program.

When this occurs, Setup installs Microsoft Plus! in the Progra~1\Plus! folder
instead of the Program Files\Plus! folder.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when Setup detects that the system cannot use long file
names.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods:

 - Reinstall Windows 95. This resets the registry key that is causing the
   problem.

 - Manually reset the registry key using Registry Editor.

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
   require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
   resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
   Registry Editor at your own risk.

   NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys
   And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
   should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
   before you edit the registry.

   Use Registry Editor to delete the Win31FileSystem key in the under the
   following registry key:

      KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem

   After you delete the key, restart the computer.
