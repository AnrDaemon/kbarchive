SUMMARY
=======

Unlike Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Microsoft Exchange Windows clients do not
allow you to directly import folders using the File Import command.

In Microsoft Exchange, the File Import command imports Microsoft Mail .MMF files,
as well as Microsoft Exchange personal address book (.PAB) files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To import folders from a .PST file, you must first add the .PST file to your
profile:

1. In the Microsoft Exchange Windows client, choose Services on the Tools menu.

2. Click Add.

3. Select Personal Folders in the Available Information Services list box.

   If you do not have Personal Folders as one of the available information
   services, contact your Microsoft Exchange administrator. The appropriate
   information service is not installed on your computer and you will need to
   reinstall the Microsoft Exchange client.

4. Click OK. A dialog box will appear, asking you for the name of the .PST file
   you want to open. If this file does not exist, a new (empty) file will be
   created. If this file does exist, select the .PST file from which you want to
   import the folders.

The folders from the new .PST file are listed along with your other folders. You
can move or copy folders or messages between the new .PST and your other .PSTs
or folders.
