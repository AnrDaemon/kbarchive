KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Novell NetWare Allow.exe tool cannot change the inherited rights mask of a
file or folder on a Windows 95-based computer that is using the Microsoft File
and Print Sharing for NetWare Networks network component.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft File and Print Sharing for NetWare Networks network component does
not support inherited rights masks for files or folders.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must set the file access rights in Windows 95. Use the right mouse button to
click the folder you want to change, and then click Sharing on the menu that
appears.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Novell NetWare servers support file sharing from the directory and the file
level. The Microsoft File and Print Sharing for NetWare Networks network
component supports file sharing on a folder-level basis only, not on a file-
level basis.
