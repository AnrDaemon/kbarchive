TITLE   :BUG: Scope on Report Command Doesn't Work as in version 2.x

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Specifying a scope for a report to print does not print the correct records from
the table.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is that the DataEnvironment object created when the report was
created performs an implicit GO TOP command as it initializes, even if the table
is already open. This is necessary so that programmatic changes to Cursor object
properties, such as Filter, take effect. A unexpected side- effect of this
recent change is that the Scope clauses (ALL, NEXT, RECORD, and REST) on the
REPORT FORM command do not affect which the records are printed.

For example, if you have a table open and the record pointer is sitting at record
5, a REPORT FORM <x> NEXT 1 should print record number 5 only. However,
because the DataEnvironment object performs a GO TOP command, the record pointer
is re-positioned as the DataEnvironment object is initiated, so record number 1
prints - not 5.

WORKAROUND
==========

To use the REST, RECORD, and NEXT Scope clauses on the REPORT FORM command, you
must prevent the implicit GO TOP command performed by the DataEnvironment
object, which can be done in any one of these ways:

 - Remove the table from the DataEnvironment object, and open it before running
   the report.

-or-

 - Keep the table in the DataEnvironment object, but set the AutoOpenTables
   property to false, and open the table manually before running the report.

-or-

 - Keep the table in the DataEnvironment object, and save and restore the record
   pointer before the report actually prints. To do this:

   1. Set AutoOpenTables to false for the DataEnvironment object.

   2. In the Init event, do the following:

         x=0               && Create a scoped variable
         this.opentables   && Call the OpenTables method
         go (x)            && Restore the Record pointer

   3. In the OpenTables method, save the record pointer:

         x=RECNO()

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Code to Reproduce Problem
-------------------------

   create table repotest (mychar c(1))
   insert into repotest values ('1')
   insert into repotest values ('2')
   insert into repotest values ('3')
   insert into repotest values ('4')
   insert into repotest values ('5')
   create report repotest from repotest
    
   goto 2
   REPORT FORM repotest next 1  &&Record 2 should print but record 1 prints
