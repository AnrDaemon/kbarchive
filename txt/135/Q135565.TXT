TITLE   :PRB: HIDE WINDOW ALL Command Affects User-Defined Toolbars
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The HIDE WINDOW ALL command hides user-defined toolbars as well as other
windows. The SHOW WINDOW ALL command shows user-defined toolbars as well as
other windows. System-defined toolbars are not affected by HIDE WINDOW ALL or
SHOW WINDOW ALL.

WORKAROUND
==========

Once the user's toolbars have been hidden with the HIDE WINDOWS ALL command, if
they are to be visible, issue a command to SHOW WINDOW <window name> where
window name is the name of one of the toolbars. Issue as many SHOW WINDOW
commands as are necessary to restore the user-created toolbars.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Developers using the command HIDE WINDOW ALL and expecting their toolbars to
stay visible may run into trouble. The toolbars are essentially the same as any
user-defined window and are thus subject to being hidden. The System toolbars,
on the other hand, are a special instance and as such remain visible unless a
HIDE WINDOW command is used with the name of the window For a list of the
correct names of the System toolbars, please see the Visual FoxPro Language
Reference or the SHOW WINDOW topic in the Help manu.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Enter the following code into a Visual FoxPro program. Then run that program to
create a toolbar on the desktop.

   *** Program Tooltest.prg **************
   PUBLIC oToolbar
   oToolbar = CREATEOBJECT("UDToolbar")
   oToolbar.show()

   DEFINE CLASS UDToolbar AS Toolbar
        Caption = "My Toolbar"
        Height = 29
        Left = 0
        Top = 0
        Width = 80

        ADD OBJECT Cbsave AS Commandbutton WITH ;
             Top = 4, ;
             Left = 6, ;
             Height = 23, ;
             Width = 24, ;
             Picture = "\vfp\wizards\wizbmps\wzsave.bmp", ;
             Caption =  "", ;
             Default = .F., ;
             Name = "CbSave"

        ADD OBJECT Cbdelete AS Commandbutton WITH ;
             Top = 4, ;
             Left = 29, ;
             Height = 23, ;
             Width = 24, ;
             Picture = "\vfp\wizards\wizbmps\wzdelete.bmp", ;
             Caption =  "", ;
             Default = .F., ;
             Name = "CbDelete"

        ADD OBJECT Cbprint AS Commandbutton WITH ;
             Top = 4, ;
             Left = 52, ;
             Height = 23, ;
             Width = 24, ;
             Picture = "\vfp\wizards\wizbmps\wzprint.bmp", ;
             Caption =  "", ;
             Default = .F., ;
             Name = "CbPrint"

   ENDDEFINE
   *** End program Tooltest.prg********************

Once the toolbar is visible, in the Command window enter this command:

      HIDE WINDOW ALL

followed by

      SHOW WINDOW ALL
