SUMMARY
=======

This article shows how to specify an Account control field in an ftp script.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a ftp client initiates a connection, the ftp-server sends a USER,PASS
access-control command to the client. The client answers with its username and
password information. Some ftp servers also require an account for login by
sending an ACCT command.

When you are using an ftp-script (ftp -s:script ) on Windows-NT, you need to
specify the ACCT field in the same line as the PASS information. The following
is an example of a script to handle this ACCT request. This script opens a
connection to IP address 11.11.11.11, logs in as MYUSER with MYPASSWORD password
and MYACCOUNT account, transfers MYFILE, and then quits:

   open 11.11.11.11
   myuser
   mypassword myaccount
   put myyfile
   quit
