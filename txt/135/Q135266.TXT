TITLE   :PRB: Converting 2.x Screen Does Not Allow Adjustable Pageframe
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you select the Functional Conversion option when converting a screen from an
earlier version of FoxPro, and then add a PageFrame control to the converted
form, you will see two pages and the PageCount property cannot be modified.

CAUSE
=====

When you convert a screen from an earlier version of FoxPro, the converter
dialog box appears asking if you would like to convert the screen via a
Functional Conversion or a Visual Conversion. The Functional Conversion provides
immediate FoxPro 2.x READ compatibility so you can use forms in Visual FoxPro
without making a lot of manual changes to the converted screen. The Visual
Conversion creates images of forms and all controls, but it copies the code from
the original FoxPro 2.x screen to a .prg file. If you choose the Functional
Conversion, the newly converted form will not allow the PageCount property of a
PageFrame control to be modified when a PageFrame is added to the form.

RESOLUTION
==========

To be able to modify the PageCount, you must set the Windowtype property to
Modal or Modeless.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem Behavior
-----------------------------------

1. Convert a version 2.x screen, choosing the Functional Conversion option.

2. Add a page frame to the newly converted form.

3. Note that the PageCount property is in italics, which means it cannot be
   changed.

4. Change the Windowtype property of the form to Modal or Modeless.

5. Note that the PageCount property of the page frame can now be changed.
