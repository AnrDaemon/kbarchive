SYMPTOMS
========

Software inventory does not find Microsoft Office version 7.0 or Microsoft Word
version 7.0 installations when you use the .PDF file included on the CD-ROM.

CAUSE
=====

Software inventory does not find Microsoft Office installation because the TIME
setting in the OFF95STD.PDF file does not match the "STF_TIME" = "0" setting in
the OFF95STD.INF file.

Software inventory does not find Microsoft Word installation because the
WRD95.PDF file on the Word for Windows 95 CD-ROM contains FILE = WORD.EXE
instead of FILE = WINWORD.EXE.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem for Microsoft Office:

1. Use a text editor such as Notepad to edit the OFF95STD.PDF text file.

2. Change TIME=12, 00 to TIME=00, 00.

To correct this problem for Microsoft Word:

1. Use a text editor such as Notepad to edit the WRD95.PDF text file.

2. Change FILE = WORD.EXE to FILE = WINWORD.EXE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office for Windows 95,
version 7.0 and Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
