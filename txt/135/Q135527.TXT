SYMPTOMS
========

After you make changes to your Windows NT configuration and restart your
computer, you may receive the following error message:

   Windows NT could not be started as configured. A previous working
   configuration was used instead.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs on computers using an Award Modular BIOS version 4.50G,
Award 4.50GP BIOS, or Award 4.50PG BIOS (the PG version supports Plug and Play).

RESOLUTION
==========

According to Award Software, if you are using the Award Modular BIOS version
4.50G you can correct this problem by changing the following CMOS settings one
at a time until the problem goes away:

 - Daylight Savings Time: disabled

 - DMACLOCK: SCLK-2

 - PRQ2detection: enabled

 - IDEHDDblockmode: disabled

NOTE: Some of these settings may not be available on all computers.

If you are using the Award 4.50PG BIOS, you can correct this problem by disabling
the Daylight Savings Time setting.

You can also correct this problem by obtaining an updated Award BIOS from your
computer manufacturer, or contact Award Software at (415) 968-4433.
