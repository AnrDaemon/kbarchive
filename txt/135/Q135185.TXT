SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Backup Exec Windows Workstation Edition 3.58 by Arcada
Software on a computer running the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks to
browse a NetWare server, you may not be able to view files that exist in
directories that also contain subdirectories.

If you select such a directory for backing up, the files in the directory are
backed up correctly, but you receive an error message for each file in the
directory.

You can view files in directories that contain no subdirectories normally.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of differences between the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks and the Novell NETX and VLM clients. Backup Exec relies on
behavior that is changed under the new client redirector.

RESOLUTION
==========

To view files in directories that contain subdirectories using Backup Exec, use
Novell's NETX or VLM client instead of the Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks.

You may want to contact Arcada Software to inquire about possible updates to the
Backup Exec program.
