======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS) client to connect to a
Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0 RAS server, the following error appears:

   RAS: Unable to connect. No more connections can be made to this remote
   computer because the computer has exceeded its client license limit.

The following error appears in the event log on the RAS server:

   Error: 20101
   Source: Remote Access
   Description: Unable to connect to com5. No more connections can be made to
   this remote computer because the computer has exceeded its client license
   limit.

When you use a Windows 3.x RAS client, the connection drops without error
notification. LAN clients can still access the server.

CAUSE
=====

The licensing service is not releasing the licenses for RAS users after they
hang up. Over time, depending on the number of licenses you have defined on the
server, all of the licenses will be taken.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, change the licensing from "Per Server" to "Per Seat."


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
