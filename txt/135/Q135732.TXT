TITLE   :PC NTMMTA: Doc Err: No WINNT Directory Created at Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following text has been documented incorrectly in the Microsoft Mail
Multitasking MTA for Windows NT Server "Administrator's Guide":

Item 1
------

In Chapter 1 on page 4, the following text is displayed:

   The executable files will be placed in subdirectories called EXTERNAL.NT,
   DIRSYNC.NT, and WINNT in the directory you specify. By default, they are
   installed in C:\MAILEXE\EXTERNAL.NT, C:\MAILEXE\DIRSYNC.NT, and
   C:\MAILEXE\WINNT.

This should read:

   The executable files will be placed in subdirectories named EXTERNAL.NT and
   DIRSYNC.NT in the directory you specify. By default, they are installed in
   C:\MAILEXE\EXTERNAL.NT and C:\MAILEXE\DIRSYNC.NT.

Item 2
------

The following text appears in the section "Copying the Files to the Windows NT
Directory":

   After Setup is complete, you need to copy the files into the Windows NT
   directory structure. Assuming Windows NT is in the C:\WINNT35 directory, do
   the following:

   To copy the files into the Windows NT directory

   Type xcopy c:\mailexe\winnt c:\winnt35 /s

The information regarding the WINNT directory should be removed or a note added
that states that this directory is not created during the NT MMTA installation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed these to be documentation errors in version 3.5 of
Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT "Administrator's Guide." These
errors were corrected in a reprint of the manuals in July 1995.

Additional query words: 3.50 service setup nt mmta
