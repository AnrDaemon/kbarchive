TITLE   :Performance Monitor Counters Produce Unlikely Results
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the HALAPIC.DLL hardware abstraction layer (HAL), applications that
query performance counters may produce unlikely results. For example, Network
Monitor Agent counters may produce numbers for network use that are known to be
incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

Applications that query Performance Counters on Intel based symmetric multi-
processing (SMP) computers may receive incorrect timer information. As a result,
counter values in Performance Monitor, and other programs that are calculated
against this timer, may be incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not already
done so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Windows NT version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
