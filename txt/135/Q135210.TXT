SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 may hang when it tries to detect the Media Vision Premium 3-D SCSI
adapter in your computer.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur with early Premium 3-D SCSI adapters. This problem
affects adapters with part number 650-0111-01 prior to revision C (for example,
part number 650-0111-01B), manufactured between 1/18/94 and 2/23/94.

The NCR SCSI controller on this adapter malfunctions when I/O port 23Fh or 33Fh
is written to during the hardware detection routine.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact Media Vision to inquire about upgrading to at least revision C of the
SCSI adapter.
