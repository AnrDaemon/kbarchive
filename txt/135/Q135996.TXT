TITLE   :External Cache Enabled in CMOS May Hang Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT may fail to shut down on some computers if the external cache options
are not set correctly in the CMOS settings. If you do not have external cache on
your motherboard, but the option is enabled in the CMOS settings, you may
experience this problem.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, turn off your external cache option in CMOS by entering
your computer's setup program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

Please notice that information contained in the SETUP.TXT file on the Windows NT
3.51 Server CD-ROM is misleading with regard to this problem. The SETUP.TXT file
states:

   Digital Venturis Systems with S3 Based Video
   --------------------------------------------
   The Digital Venturis line of computers with S3 based
   video may experience problems when attempting to
   restart. When selecting Shutdown/Restart, the
   system may freeze when attempting to reset the S3
   video. This is in no way detrimental to the system,
   simply restart via the reset button or power off the
   computer. This issue will be addressed in the near
   future.

This statement does not address the real issue: the problem occurs because the
cache option is enabled in CMOS. Furthermore, current versions of the DEC
Venturis have no reset button.
