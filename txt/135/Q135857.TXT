TITLE   :Err Msg: Invalid Parameter Specified After Configuring EMM386
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure memory for a Windows remoteboot workstation using EMM386.EXE
as stated in page 136 of the Windows NT Server Installation Guide for both
Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51, the following error message appears:

   Invalid parameter specified.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, manually determine and reconfigure the lowest
acceptable memory range for the remoteboot workstation.

For example, if the MS-DOS MEM.EXE reports that you have 512,000 bytes of
available conventional memory, the hexadecimal value is 7D00. However, when you
exclude the range from 7D00 to 9FFF, the above error message appears. After
further testing, you determine that the lowest acceptable value is 516,096 bytes
of available conventional memory. The hexadecimal equivalent value is 7E00. The
memory range that you must use is different for each network interface card.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 136 of the Windows NT Server Installation Guide for Windows NT Server 3.5
and 3.51 states the following:

1. Find out how much conventional memory the workstation has (in decimal terms)
   by typing mem at the MS-DOS prompt.

2. Convert this number to hexadecimal format and drop the rightmost digit. To
   convert, you can use the dectohex command in the
   \systemroot\RPL\RPLFILES\BINFILES\BINR directory.

3. Edit the device=EMM386.EXE line in the CONFIG.SYS file:

   a. Remove the REM designation at the beginning of the line. Check that the
      path specified for the file is the root (C:\) directory, not the C:\DOS
      directory.

   b. Use the remaining four digits of the hexadecimal value for the first x=
      value. (The second x= value is 9FFF and should not be changed.)

      For example, if conventional memory is 598016, the hexadecimal value is
      92000. In this case, use x=9200-9FFF.
