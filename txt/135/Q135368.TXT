PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.2,1.3,2.0,95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtlc kbmsn

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 1.2, 1.3, 2.0 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to retrieve your e-mail on The Microsoft Network, you may
experience one of the following symptoms:

 - The Microsoft Network may not appear under the Remote Mail or Deliver Now
   Using command.

 - The Remote Mail and Deliver Now Using commands may be unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

These issues may occur if your Windows 95 user name contains an invalid
character such as a backslash, comma, or period. Your Windows 95 user name is
used to create your Remote Mail headers file (in the form "MOS<Windows 95
user name>.rhc"). If your Windows 95 user name is not a valid file name, you
may experience the issues described above.

If you are not using an invalid character, the .rhc file may be damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, change your Windows 95 user name so that all the
characters are valid for file names.

If your user name is valid, delete the "MOS<Windows 95 user name>.rhc" file
from the Windows folder.
