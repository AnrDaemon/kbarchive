TITLE   :PRB: List Box Does Not Respect NumberOfElements
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a

KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you work with a list box in Visual FoxPro 3.0x and you specify a value for
the NumberOfElements property and the ColumnCount property, the NumberOfElements
will not be respected. In Visual FoxPro 5.0x, the same behavior occurs when the
ColunmCount property is set to a value other than 1.

WORKAROUND
==========

The NumberOfElements property is used only when the RowSourceType for a list box
is an array. When using an array as the RowSourceType, you can redimension the
array to the number of elements you want to display. For example, you could add
the following code to either the form's Load event procedure or the list box's
Init event procedure:

      DIMENSION testa[ 2, ALEN( testa, 2 ) ]

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In the Command window enter the code below.

   Open the Customer table and execute the following code:

         Dimension testa[5,2]
         copy to array testa fields cust_id,country

2. Create a new form.

3. Add a list box to the form.

4. Change the list box properties as follows:

         RowSourceType = 5 - Array
         RowSource =  testa
         NumberOfElements = 2
         ColumnCount = 2

5. Save and run the form.

   In Visual FoxPro 3.0x, the list box shows 5 items, not 2. In Visual FoxPro
   5.0x, changing the ColumnCount property to 1 seems to make the behavior
   disappear. However, the problem reappears if the ColumnCount is set to any
   other value.
