TITLE   :Backup Cannot Span Multiple Disks with Removable Disk Drive

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Backup to back up files to a removable disk other than floppy
disks, Backup does not prompt you to insert a second disk if the entire backup
does not fit on one disk. Instead, you receive the following error message:

   Errors occurred during this operation. Do you want to view them now?

The incomplete backup volume on the first disk is automatically deleted and
cannot be restored.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you are using Backup to back up files to a removable disk other than floppy
disks, perform only backups that fit on one disk. Large backups that require
more than one disk should be broken up into smaller backups, each of which fits
on one disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although Backup does support the use of removable disk drives such as Bernoulli
and Syquest drives, it does not support performing backups that span multiple
disks with these drives. Backup can span multiple disks only on floppy disk
drives connected to the primary floppy disk drive controller.
