SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the functionality of the Find and Search buttons on a Form
Wizard-generated form to clarify what the search is actually doing.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When you click the Find button on a Form Wizard-generated form, the Search
dialog box appears so you can select the field and operator, and then insert a
value for the search criteria. If the search criteria produces at least one
matching record, a filter is set to that criteria and the record(s) available
will be limited by that filter.

The availability of the navigational controls Top, Prev, Next, and Bottom is also
affected. If the search criteria produces a single match, these controls will be
disabled. Enabling and disabling of these controls will be performed depending
on the location of the record pointer within the filter.

To clear the search criteria filter and regain access to all of the table
records, click the Find Button, and then click the All button in the Search
dialog box.

Additional query words: Navigate Disable Seek
