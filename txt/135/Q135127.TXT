When you establish trust relationships between two Windows NT domain
controllers using User Manager for Domains, the following message appears:

   Trust relationship with <other domain name> successfully established.

When you establish trust relationships between a Windows or Windows for
Workgroups client computer using Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 Server Tools and
a Windows NT domain controller, the following message appears on the
client computer's User Manager for Domains:

   Windows NT 3.5 Server Tools

   The trust relationship could not be verified at this time. If you find that
   it was not established, contact the administrator of the <other domain
   name> domain and verify that it has permitted <your domain name> to
   trust.

   Windows NT 3.51 Server Tools

   You have changed a trust relationship between domains. This client cannot
   verify changes to trust relationships. If you find that it was not
   established, contact the administrator of the <other domain name>
   domain and verify that it has permitted <your domain> to trust.

The message displayed by User Manager for Domains in Windows NT 3.51 Server
Tools explains why the trust relationship cannot be verified, whereas the
User Manager for Domains in Windows NT 3.5 Server Tools error message does
not.
