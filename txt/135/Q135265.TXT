SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to use a combo box in Visual FoxPro to filter the contents of a
grid by using the value property of the combo box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To filter out certain records within a table, use the SET FILTER command along
with the value property of the combo box.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a form by using the CREATE FORM <form name> command.

2. Open the Testdata.dbc database in the VFP\Samples\Data directory. Add the
   Customer table to the data environment. Drag the Customer table from the data
   environment onto the form to create a grid.

3. Add a combo box to the form from the controls toolbar, and in the Name
   property, type:

      cboTest

4. In the RowSource property of the combo box, type some data that you know is
   in the table, separating each of the values with commas. For example, type:

   " Germany,France,Spain" (without the quotation marks)

5. For the RowSourceType property, select Value.

6. In the Click event of the combo box, type this code:

      SELECT Customer
      SET FILTER TO Country = Thisform.cboTest.Value
      Thisform.Refresh()

7. Save and Run the form. When you selecting one of the items in the combo box,
   the grid reflects only those records that pertain to that item.
