TITLE   :Hardware Detection Hangs with Xircom Pocket Ethernet Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The hardware detection portion of Setup may stop responding (hang) if you have a
Xircom Pocket Ethernet adapter connected to a parallel port on your computer
using a Phantom Power cable.

CAUSE
=====

The Phantom Power cable plugs into the PS/2 mouse port and the Xircom Pocket
Ethernet adapter to power the adapter. However, most laptop computers do not
have enough power on the PS/2 mouse port to fully power the Xircom adapter. This
problem has been observed with the following Xircom parallel port adapters:

 - PE3-10B2 (BNC connector)

 - PE3-10BT (twisted pair)

 - PE3-10BC (both BNC and twisted pair)


RESOLUTION
==========

Use the AC power cord supplied with the Xircom power adapter during Setup. Once
Setup is finished, you can use the Phantom Power cable.
