KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the MS-DOS path contains elements with certain extended characters, the
characters may not be displayed correctly in the login script processor when you
use the MAP command to display search paths.

CAUSE
=====

The extended characters are not properly converted from the OEM to the ANSI
character set before being displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can safely ignore the display problem. Or, change the path names so that
they do not contain extended characters.
