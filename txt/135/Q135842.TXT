TITLE   :DOC: SQL Statement Disagrees with Text Description
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

KEYWORDS:kbdocfix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Page 355 in the Developer's Guide has a text description followed by code to
display companies that have more than $50,000 in total orders for the year.
However, the SQL statement displays companies with more than $1,000 in total
orders for the year.

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SQL statement currently reads as follows:

SELECT customer.company_name, SUM(orders.freight) ;

      FROM tastrade!customer, tastrade!orders ;
      WHERE customer.customer_id = orders.customer_id ;
      GROUP BY customer.company_name ;
      HAVING SUM(orders.freight) > 1000 ;
      ORDER BY 2 DESC

This SQL statement's HAVING clause should be changed to the following to display
companies with more than $50,000 in total orders for the year and to match the
text description:

      HAVING SUM(orders.freight) > 50000 ;
