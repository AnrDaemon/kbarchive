======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A template class that contains a static data member of a type that was not
pre-defined, such as a struct or a class, causes this error:

   

   C2985 <var name> : invalid static data member; template class < template
   class name> already has a function member of the same name.

This error occurs on the line where the static data member is externally
declared.

RESOLUTION
==========

Explicitly initialize the static data member when it is declared. This may
require adding a constructor to the structure (see the sample code).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
32-bit Edition, version 4.0.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed: None (compiler defaults will do)
   */ 
   struct A {
   //   A() {}  // ctor added for explicit initialization
      void some_funct(){}
   };
   template <class T> struct B {
       static A static_member;
       void func() { static_member.some_funct(); }
   };
   // error will occur on the following line:

   template <class T> A B<T>::static_member /* = A() */ ;

   void main()
   {
      B<int> b;

      b.func();
   }

This code, as shown, generates the error. To work around the problem, change the
line where A() is declared and defined from a comment into an executed line, and
do the same for the = A() on the line where the error is occurring. This
explicitly initializes the data member when it is declared.
