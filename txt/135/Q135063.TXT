TITLE   :XCON: Changing MTA Conformance on X.400 Connectors Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the message transfer agent (MTA) conformance of a Microsoft Exchange Server
X.400 connector is changed while the Microsoft Exchange MTA is running, messages
will be either returned with a nondelivery report (NDR) or lost entirely.

CAUSE
=====

When communication occurs between Microsoft Exchange sites, the X.400 connectors
at both ends should be configured to use the same MTA conformance, either the
1984 or 1988 standard. If the X.400 connector on one server uses one type of MTA
conformance and the other server uses another type, the encoded message
transfers between servers will not be interpreted correctly. This is because the
reliable transfer service element (RTSE) settings defined by the 1984 and 1988
standards are not compatible with each other.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that the MTA conformance option found on the X.400 connector's advanced
properties page matches what is used by the Exchange Server or other X.400
system at the other end of the connection, either 1984 or 1988. If you need to
make any changes, restart all the services on both servers. This will re-encode
any messages in the queue waiting to be transmitted.
