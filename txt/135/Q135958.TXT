TITLE   :Second Instance of ScanDisk Returns Incorrect Exit Code
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you schedule two ScanDisk tasks in System Agent that overlap, the second task
quits immediately with an exit code of 0. This causes ScanDisk to report that no
errors were found, even though ScanDisk did not complete its scan.

CAUSE
=====

You can run only one instance of ScanDisk at a time. If you try to start a
second instance, the second instance quits immediately, and generates an
incorrect exit code.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not schedule two ScanDisk tasks in System Agent that overlap.
