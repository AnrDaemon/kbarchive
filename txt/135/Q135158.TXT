TITLE   :Titanium Seal Menu Program Does Not Run Properly

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run a program from the MS-DOS-based menu program Titanium Seal,
rather than running the program, Titanium Seal exits.

CAUSE
=====

The Titanium Seal program does not work properly if you try to run it by
double-clicking the program's icon or by clicking the Start button, clicking
Run, and then typing its name in the Run dialog box.

RESOLUTION
==========

To ensure that the Titanium Seal program runs properly, run it from an MS- DOS
prompt. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt on
   the menu that appears.

2. At the MS-DOS prompt, type "seal" (without the quotation marks).

NOTE: You may also have to type the path to the program. For example, you may
have to type "c:\seal\seal" (without the quotation marks).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Titanium Seal assumes that Command.com is present to accept keystrokes that are
left behind by the program when it terminates. If you run the program from the
Windows 95 interface instead of from the MS-DOS Prompt, Command.com is not
present to handle the leftover keystrokes; therefore, the program is unable to
run other programs from its menu.
