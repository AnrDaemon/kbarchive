The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following text is taken from the PowerPoint for Windows 95 version
7.0 Readme file (Ppreadme.txt).

   Installable filters are provided with PowerPoint for Windows 95
   version 7.0 which you can add to a PowerPoint 4.0 installation that
   allows PowerPoint 4.0 to read presentations created with PowerPoint
   7.0. New graphic effects and features of PowerPoint 7.0 are not
   available when the presentation is opened in PowerPoint 4.0, but
   reappear normally when subsequently opened in PowerPoint 7.0,
   provided the presentation is not saved from PowerPoint 4.0.

   For the Windows version of PowerPoint, the Vsetup program is provided
   which performs the necessary installation procedure to add the filter
   to PowerPoint 4.0. Simply copying the filters to users' machines will
   not work. The Vsetup must be used to install them. For the Macintosh
   version of PowerPoint, you can simply copy the filter to the
   PowerPoint folder.

A PowerPoint 7.0 translator is available that allows PowerPoint
4.0 for the Macintosh to read PowerPoint 7.0 for Windows 95 files. The
Macintosh 7.0 translator includes the 68k and Power Macintosh versions.
You can obtain the Macintosh version of the translator from online
services.

One method to read PowerPoint 95 presentations on your Macintosh, is to
first save the presentation in PowerPoint 4.0 format.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The actual file that enables backwards compatibility with PowerPoint 4.0
is Pp7trans.dll. However, as stated above, merely copying a file or set of
files to the PowerPoint 4.0 machine will not enable backward compatibility.
Vsetup must be run.
