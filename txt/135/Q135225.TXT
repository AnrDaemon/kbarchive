SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the support software for a Gateway 2000 Aztech sound card, the
installation program displays a message stating that it is restarting Windows
95. The installation program then reports that it can be installed only in
Windows 3.1, and restarts the computer. You may also receive an error message
concerning the DMA channel used by the sound card.

CAUSE
=====

The support software for this sound card was designed for Windows 3.1 and fails
to correctly identify Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

The drivers for the sound card should be installed correctly, even though you
received the error message stated above. If you received an error message
concerning the DMA channel, follow these steps to verify or adjust the DMA
setting:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

2. On the Device Manager tab, double-click the Sound, Video, And Game
   Controllers branch.

3. Click the Aztech sound card, and then click Properties.

4. On the Resources tab, check the DMA setting. If you think the setting may be
   incorrect for the sound card, consult the sound card's documentation for the
   correct setting.
