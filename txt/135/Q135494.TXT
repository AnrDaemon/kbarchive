TITLE   :Failure of One SDLC Multidrop Connection Reactivates All Others
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A multidrop connection is a connection through which a primary computer
communicates with multiple secondary computers. SNA Server supports multidrop
connections to peer or downstream computers on leased SDLC lines. You can
configure up to four multidrop connections on each line with one SNA Server
server acting as primary on each.

When SNA Server Admin is configured with more than 1 multidrop primary SDLC
connections and the active connection has an outage or timeout, the failing
connection is reactivated. However, all the other connections using the same
link service are (incorrectly) activated or reactivated as well.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
