TITLE   :BUG: Group Header Information Prints Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Group header information prints incorrectly when all of the following are true:

 - The group is defined to start on a new page.

 - The group header is defined to print on every page.

 - The group footer is the only band that prints on the last page of the group.

In this case, the group header information printed on the last page of the group
is actually the header information for the next record. In Visual FoxPro version
5.0, the group header does not print at all in this case.

WORKAROUND
==========

This workaround does not apply to Visual FoxPro version 5.0. There does not
appear to be a workaround to make the group footer print in the case described
above.

1. Add a field to the Group Header. Set the field expression to a variable (for
   example, "repx").

2. Add a field to the Group Footer. Set "Print Only When Expression is True" to
   .F. and "Field Expression" to a UDF (for example, "letsgo()").

3. In the UDF type the following:

         repx=AGROUPS(i)  &&agroups is array that holds group header info.
         IF i<ALEN(agroups)
           i=i+1
         ENDIF
         RETURN

4. Create a program for calling the report. Type the following into the prg:

         Select <insert fieldname of group> from <insert tablename> ;
           Group by <insert fieldname of group> into array agroups
         i=2

STATUS
======
