DOCUMENT:Q135175  17-DEC-2000  [win95x]
TITLE   :Cannot Use Two Xircom PCMCIA Network Cards at Once
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you start Windows 95 with one Xircom PCMCIA network card inserted in the
computer, the card works correctly until you insert a second Xircom PCMCIA
network card. When you insert the second card, the second card works correctly
and the first stops working. If you remove and reinsert the first card, it works
correctly and the second card stops working.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because both cards have the same PCMCIA ID but different
checksums. The cards both appear to be the same card to Windows 95, so Windows
95 switches system resources from one card to the other.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you must run two network cards at the same time, they cannot both be Xircom
network cards.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
