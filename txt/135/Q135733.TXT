-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run SETUP.EXE for the Mail Multitasking Message Transfer Agent (NT
MMTA), one of the following errors may occur:

   Setup has encountered a problem.
   Please report File='COMMON\INF01.C', Line='253' to Microsoft Product Support
   Services

   -or-

   Win32s - Error
   The procedure entry point "GetVersionExA" could not be located in the Dynamic
   Link Library "KERNEL32.dll"

If you select OK, you get the following error:

   Cannot run program
   Unexpected error:21

When you start the NT MMTA from the command line or a batch file, the following
error may occur:

   OS/2 is required to run the program.

CAUSE
=====

For the first error, you are trying to run the Setup program from within
Microsoft Windows 95.

For the second error, you are trying to run the NT MMTA Setup from Microsoft
Windows version 3.1 with the Win32s libraries installed.

For the third error, you are trying to run the NT MMTA from an unsupported
platform, such as Alpha, MIPS, or the PowerPC processor.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run Setup for the NT MMTA from an Intel-x86 or Pentium-based Windows NT Server,
version 3.51 or later.

You may get the first error if you install from a Microsoft Windows 95 computer
to a Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51. To resolve the problem, install
direct to the Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although the Windows 95 and Windows 3.1 with Windows 32s libraries allow
operation of some Windows NT programs, they do not support an OS/2 subsystem.
Therefore, the NT MMTA cannot be used.

The NT MMTA uses the OS/2 subsystem on a Intel-x86 or Pentium-based Windows NT
Server machine. Other Windows NT platforms include Alpha, MIPS, and the PowerPC
processors. Windows NT does not support the OS/2 subsystem on these platforms.
Therefore, the NT MMTA will not function.

You may also get the following error when you try to start the NT MMTA from
either MS-DOS, Windows 3.x, or Windows 95:

   OS/2 is required to run the program
