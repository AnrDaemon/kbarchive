TITLE   :DOC: Help File Gives Incorrect Info on ColumnCount Property
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocfix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Help file incorrectly states the following for the ColumnCount Property:

   For a ComboBox or ListBox control, the ColumnCount property specifies the
   number of Columns the control contains. If ColumnCount is set to -1, the
   control mimics FoxPro version 2.x behavior. If you set ColumnCount to 0, no
   Columns are displayed.

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In fact, if the ColumnCount property is set to -1 for a ListBox or ComboBox
control, the following error occurs:

   Expression Evaluated to an Illegal Value

In addition, if the ColumnCount property is set to 0, and a RowSource is
specified, the first column (if applicable) of the RowSource is displayed. For
example, if the RowSource is set to Customer table, the RowSourceType is set to
2-Alias, and the ColumnCount is set to 0, then the first column of the Customer
table will be displayed in the ListBox or ComboBox control.
