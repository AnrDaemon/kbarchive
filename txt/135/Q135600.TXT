The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 17, page 514, of the "Windows NT 3.51 System Guide" and the online
help incorrectly state the following:

   For the Security log, the administrator can also set auditing policies in
   User Manager that cause the system to halt when the security log is full.

This is a documentation error in Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51. To cause the
system to halt when the security log is full you must manually configure
the registry. The procedure for this is located on page 197 of the Windows
NT Resource Kit Version 3.51 Update book.
