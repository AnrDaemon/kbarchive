TITLE   :PRB: Can't Define Text Object ControlSource Property in a Grid
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to change the ControlSource Property of the Text1 text object in
a column of a grid, you receive this error message:

   Parent object will not allow this property setting Text1.ControlSource

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. This occurs because when the column is bound, the
ControlSource property is implicitly set.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the Bound property to false (.F.) for the column. If the column is not
bound, you can set the ControlSource for Text1.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. It follows the principle of inheritance in Object
Oriented Programming. The column is bound to a ControlSource already, so the
Text1 object in the column is inheriting the same ControlSource property.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a grid on a form.

2. Define a column. (You may need to specify a ColumnCount.)

3. Select Text1 in the Property Sheet's Object box.

4. Click the Data tab.

5. Select the ControlSource property.

6. Click the Expression box down arrow.

The error "Parent object will not allow this property setting ...
Text1.ControlSource" is displayed.
