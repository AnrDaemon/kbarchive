SUMMARY
=======

This article describes where to get the Microsoft Open Database Connectivity
(ODBC) version 2.10b Software Development Kit (SDK) files, and how to upgrade
from version 2.10a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A self-expanding PKzip file called ODBC210B.EXE is available via the Internet at
the site listed below to enable you to upgrade the ODBC SDK version 2.10a to
ODBC SDK version 2.10b.

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/ODBC/public/ODBC210B.EXE


The zipfile expands to the following files:

   ODBC16UT DL_         3,221 08-17-94  12:00a
   ODBC32   DL_         3,888 08-17-94  12:00a
   ODBC16   IN_         4,036 06-02-95   2:30p
   ODBC32   IN_         2,960 06-02-95   2:02p
   ODBCSDK  IN_         6,031 06-02-95   2:57p
   EXPAND   EXE        16,129 09-30-93   5:20a
   README   TXT           203 07-25-95   9:07a

When expanded to their appropriate sizes, ODBC32.DLL (ODBC Thunking Driver
Manager) and ODBC16UT.DLL are the complete set of files required to upgrade the
components from the ODBC 2.10a SDK to version 2.10b. The file EXPAND.EXE has
been included with this zipfile for your convenience.

Use the following commands to expand the two required components:

   expand odbc16ut.dl_ odbc16ut.dll
   expand odbc32.dl_ odbc32.dll

If the ODBC SDK version 2.10a is already installed on your computer, you can
upgrade to version 2.10b by using the following commands:

   copy odbc16ut.dll c:\windows\system
   copy odbc32.dll c:\windows\system

If you have not installed 2.10a on your computer yet and have the Microsoft
Developer Network (MSDN) Level 2, July 1995 CD and would like to install the
entire ODBC 2.10b SDK at once, you should copy the ODBC 2.10a SDK from the MSDN
CD, then copy the required 2.10b components and the updated INF files included
with this zipfile into the directory on your harddrive where you would like to
install the ODBC 2.10b SDK.

This is a good option if you expect to install ODBC 2.10b onto several computers
on your network. The ODBC 2.10a SDK is located in the ODBC\X86 directory of the
CD marked "U.S.: Windows NT Service Packs, Windows Versions, and SDKs." It is
also marked "CD 2 of 19 of the MSDN Development Platform CDs."

Use the following commands to create a setup directory for the installation of
the ODBC 2.10b SDK (in this example, your CD drive is drive D: and the install
directory that you wish to create is C:\ODBC210B\INSTALL, under which you have
previously copied the ODBC 2.10a SDK):

1. cd <to the directory where the zipfile is expanded>

2. expand odbc16.in_ odbc16.inf

3. expand odbc32.in_ odbc32.inf

4. expand odbcsdk.in_ odbcsdk.inf

5. copy *.inf c:\odbc210b\install

6. copy d:\odbc\x86\*.* c:\odbc210b\install

At this point, you are prepared to install ODBC SDK 2.10b from
C:\ODBC210B\INSTALL by running SETUP.EXE.
