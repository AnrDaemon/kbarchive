SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to remove a modem using the Modems tool in Control Panel while
Device Manager is open, you may receive the following error message:

   Rundll32.exe has performed an illegal operation.

CAUSE
=====

The error message occurs because Windows 95 detects that the system
configuration has changed and sends a message to the Modems tool to update its
list of modems at the same time that the information for that modem is being
removed from memory.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

 - Close the Modems tool and use Device Manager to remove the modem.

 - Close Device Manager before you remove the modem in the Modems tool.
