======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you add a Media Vision ProAudio Spectrum sound card to your computer,
Windows 95 performance may seem to decrease.

CAUSE
=====

There may be a DMA conflict between the sound card and another device.

ProAudio Spectrum sound cards have a Thunder chip set that can use only DMA
channel 1. If another device is already using DMA channel 1, there is a resource
conflict.


RESOLUTION
==========

Because the ProAudio Spectrum sound card must use DMA channel 1, you must
reconfigure the other conflicting device to use a different DMA channel.
