TITLE   :Default Printer Not Changed in PowerPoint
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the default printer in Windows 95 while PowerPoint is running, the
target printer for the current presentation does not change to the new default.

CAUSE
=====

The way PowerPoint for Windows 95 handles the default printer is different from
the way earlier versions of PowerPoint handle it.

When you create a new presentation, by default it is set up to print to the
Windows 95 default printer. However, if you change that default printer while
the presentation is open, PowerPoint does not automatically recompose the
presentation for the new printer driver.

If you close your presentation and then re-open it, it will be set up for the new
printer driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, reset the printer before you print the presentation.

To reset the printer, use the following steps:

1. On the File menu, click Print.

2. Choose the desired printer from the Name list.

3. Click OK.
