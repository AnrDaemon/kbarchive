SUMMARY
=======

Windows 95 Setup adds the following line to the [boot] section of the System.ini
file:

   *DisplayFallback=0

This line allows Windows 95 to use the standard VGA driver if the preferred video
driver fails to load during the setup process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

User.exe adds this line to the System.ini file just before loading a display
driver. If the specified driver fails to load, the value of the line is changed
to 1, the computer is restarted, and the standard VGA driver is loaded.

Note that the DisplayFallback feature does not work properly with video drivers
written for earlier versions of Windows.

Additional query words: safe mode
