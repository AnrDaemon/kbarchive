TITLE   :Page Fault When Setup Detects Future Domain SCSI Controller
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive a page fault error message when Setup is detecting the Future
Domain SCSI controller in your computer. You may receive this error message even
if you do not have a Future Domain SCSI controller installed in your computer.

CAUSE
=====

386Max software is installed. This software makes the Adaptec ROM region
read-only. When Setup tries to write to the region, the error occurs. Note that
this error occurs only when you are running Setup from MS-DOS. The problem does
not occur if you run Setup from Windows or Windows for Workgroups in 386
enhanced mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Quit Setup, unload the 386Max software, and then run Setup again.

 - Quit Setup, and then run Setup from Windows or Windows for Workgroups version
   3.x in 386 enhanced mode instead of from MS-DOS.
