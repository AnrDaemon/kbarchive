-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 3.1 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you select a black or white color swatch in the Slide Color Scheme dialog box
or the Colors And Lines dialog box and then go to the More Colors dialog box,
moving the cross-hairs on the color palette will not change the Color or Solid
squares. If you select any color swatch other than black or white, the Color and
Solid squares change color to reflect the location of the cross-hairs on the
color palette.

RESOLUTION
==========

To get to the More Colors dialog box, you must first go to the Other Colors
dialog box. If, while you are there, you click any color besides black or white,
the More Colors dialog box will behave normally when you get there.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PowerPoint version 4.0 and 7.0
for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
