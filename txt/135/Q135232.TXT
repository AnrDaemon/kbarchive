The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

MACGATE.EXE can be run as an idle process to Dispatch. The following are the
requirements:

 - It must run for a specified amount of time.

 - It must be in a batch file which name must not include the word macgate.

NOTE: MACGATE.EXE must be run via a batch file because of a problem in the way
that MACGATE.EXE deals with the -BR (break relative) option that is passed to
the idle process by Dispatch. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q109700 MACGATE.EXE Does Not Accept -BR Command-Line Option

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an example of a valid Dispatch command line:

   dispatch -dm -i"loop.bat"

where the contents of LOOP.BAT would be:

   macgate -dm

You can configure MACGATE.EXE to run for a specified number of minutes by signing
into the gateway Macintosh Mail Server as Network Manager and running the Mail,
Gateway, Configuration option. Then set the Runtime variable to the desired
time.

For additional information on the gateway configuration dialog box, please see
page 29 of the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks,
"Administrator's Guide."

Other external processes can be run within the idle process batch file. For
example, the following LOOP.BAT will run SCHDIST.EXE for one instance,
EXTERNAL.EXE for 10 minutes, SMTPGATE.EXE for 10 minutes, and MACGATE.EXE

   schdist -dm -i1
   external -dm -br00:00:10
   smtpgate -dm -br00:00:10
   macgate -dm


Additional query words: 3.x break relative
