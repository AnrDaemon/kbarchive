Time software, may fail to change the desktop wallpaper.

CAUSE

The settings you choose in the program's interface are written to the System.ini
file, not the registry. Windows 95 looks in the registry for these settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

Please contact the program's manufacturer for information about possible
resolutions to this problem.

STATUS
