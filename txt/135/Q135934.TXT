TITLE   :DriveSpace 3 Operation Fails if Disk Defragmenter Is Running
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Disk Defragmenter is running on one drive and you try to use DriveSpace 3 in
protected mode to upgrade another drive from DoubleSpace or Drive- Space to
DriveSpace 3 or to uncompress another drive, you may receive the following error
messages:

   - Windows could not start the DEFRAG.EXE program. Copy the program file to
   the C:\ directory and then try again.

   - There was not enough free space on drive D to complete this task. Some
   files have not been upgraded to DriveSpace 3 format. These files have been
   copied to drive H. If you want to upgrade these files you must delete
   unwanted files from drive D and then try again.

   - Not enough free space to upgrade. Between drive H and its host D at least
   2.00 MB of physical free space is needed. Try deleting files or moving files
   to other drives to free up space.

CAUSE
=====

Only one instance of Disk Defragmenter can run at a time. If Disk Defragmenter
is running on another drive, DriveSpace 3 cannot start it as part of the process
of upgrading or uncompressing the drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

Quit Disk Defragmenter before you use DriveSpace 3 to compress, upgrade, or
uncompress a drive.

When you encounter the error messages listed above, two compressed volume files
(CVFs) may be left on the drive. These are the original CVF and the new
DriveSpace 3 CVF. To complete the upgrade, move the remaining files from the
original CVF to the DriveSpace 3 CVF. This procedure may entail reducing the
size of the original CVF and increasing the size of the DriveSpace 3 CVF. You
may have to do this more than once. Once you move all the files from the
original CVF, delete the original CVF using DriveSpace.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can upgrade a drive in protected mode if the drive does not contain Windows
95, does not contain the swap file, and is not referenced in the System.ini
file.
