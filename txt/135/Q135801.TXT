TITLE   :BUG: Print Preview Toolbar May Be Off Screen
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS: 3.0,3.0b,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The print preview toolbar may only be partially viewable if you have a toolbar,
such as the Standard toolbar, docked at the top of the screen, and only a small
amount of space exists to the right of the already docked toolbar. The Print
Preview toolbar continues off the screen to the right.

If you zoom the following items to full screen, the title bar of the window
disappears, the Close button appears to the left of the File Menu, and the Zoom
button appears to the right of the Help Menu. This happens when you zoom the
following windows:

 - Print Preview window for Reports/Labels.

 - The editing window for the Report, Label, Form, Program, or Class Browser

CAUSE
=====

When Visual FoxPro requests a dock to the top of the window, the toolbar manager
should determine if it will fit on the current row, and if not, it should open
up a new row. Currently, however, the toolbar manager will only open up a new
row if none of the new toolbar will be visible.

RESOLUTION
==========

Undock the Print Preview toolbar and close the report by clicking the Close
button on the toolbar. The next time you preview the report, the Print Preview
toolbar will appear in the previous undocked location.

As an alternative, you can close or undock all other toolbars before doing a
Print Preview of the report.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
