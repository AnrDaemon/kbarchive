TITLE   :SMTP: Unable to Send SMTP Mail Messages from Downstream PO
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Downstream postoffices (PO) with the SMTP Access Component installed can not
send SMTP messages; the mail messages are still in the SMTP queue and have not
been picked up by the External Mail program. However, Microsoft Mail messages
are sent successfully in both directions from the downstream postoffice to the
gateway postoffice, and incoming SMTP mail is successfully routed to the
Downstream postoffice. No errors are listed in the SESSION.LOG, and mail is not
returned with an error.

CAUSE
=====

After you install the SMTP Access Component on the downstream postoffice, the
gateway postoffice is deleted from the External-Admin option in ADMIN.EXE. Then
it is added back (one reason would be for troubleshooting purposes).

The NETWORK.GLB file was not updated to show the correct hex value for the
gateway postoffice's MBG and KEY files. When a user on the downstream postoffice
sends SMTP mail, it is being put into the SMTP <hexid>.MBG and
<hexid>.KEY files; however, the External Mail program does not know what
postoffice to send the SMTP Mail to. As a result, it ignores the mail.

ADMIN.EXE should recognize that the gateway postoffice is a hub postoffice, but
it does not and subsequently allows the administrator to delete it.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: Debugging the NETWORK.GLB file and changing the hex value to the correct
hex value (matching the gateway postoffice's hex value in the XTN file) does NOT
fix this problem and is NOT recommended.

When the SMTP gateway postoffice reference is deleted from a downstream
postoffice with the SMTP Access Component installed, you must run the following
to remove the SMTP Access Component from the downstream PO:

   install -r

Then run INSTALL to put the files back again and to update the NETWORK.GLB and
other files.

This information may also apply to other gateways.
