TITLE   :PRB: Deleted Project Files Are Not Converted with DELTA_SS.EXE
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.1; WINDOWS:3.1,4.0,5.0; winnt:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500 kbSSafe310

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows NT, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for MS-DOS, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a file has been deleted in Delta, the Delta_SS conversion never adds the file
or any of its history to the SourceSafe project.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because if a file has been deleted from Delta, another file using
the same name can be added later. Consider the following Log.mvm excerpt:

1. 1/1/91 addfile fileA

2. 1/2/91 delfile fileA

3. 1/3/91 addfile fileA (different file)

Delta_SS reads the entire log file and skips entries that refer to files that
have been deleted.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
