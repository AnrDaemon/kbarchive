The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

If you rename a shared folder or printer, it is no longer shared.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sharing information is stored in the registry under the folder or printer name.
If you change the name of the folder or printer, it is no longer shared. Even if
you rename the folder or printer to the same name, Windows 95 does not check to
see if the new name matches the old name.

If you accidentally delete a folder or printer name, press ESC when you are
prompted "You must specify a printer name." Pressing ESC at this prompt restores
the original name and maintains the item's sharing status.

Additional query words: 4.0
