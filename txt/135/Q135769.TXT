TITLE   :SMS: Error 313 SCHEDULER Reports Out of Sync on Slow Link
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbScheduler smsscheduler

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you use System Management Server, Scheduler may incorrectly generate a pair
of event 313 messages when you make changes to site properties of a site that is
located over slow link (SNA/RAS). The changes are processed successfully on the
second attempt.

CAUSE
=====

System Management Server is designed to recover if a process fails. These errors
are benign and will self correct. However, the pair of Scheduler events may
appear in the event log each time property changes are made and saved for
execution.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
