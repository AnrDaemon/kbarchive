PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A Microsoft Mail for PC Networks downstream Connection Gateway postoffice can be
created without the need to use the Connection Setup disk. You can create an
external postoffice definition by running ADMIN.EXE and selecting
External_Admin, Create. Then declare the proxynet/proxypo as being indirect via
the gateway servers network_name/postoffice_name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Even though Mail for PC Networks users will be able to get details and see the
server name associated with the gateway address, the users will lose the ability
to one-off address to AppleTalk Mail users if the administrator chooses to
create the downstream definition without the Setup disk.

Microsoft recommends that you use the version 3.2 Mail Connection Setup disk
whenever possible.
