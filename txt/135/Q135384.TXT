The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.6a

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive incorrect results from an IF...ENDIF when you have unbalanced
parentheses in the logical expression or if the later part of the expression has
a syntactical error and the beginning of the expression can be logically
evaluated.

CAUSE
=====

This is a compatibility issue. Anything that cannot be logically parsed in the
expression is treated as a comment on the same line if at least some of the
first part of the expression can be evaluated to a logical value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.
