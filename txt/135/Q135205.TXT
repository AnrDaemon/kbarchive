SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install a program from a network drive, the Setup program may
not work correctly, resulting in an error message or an incomplete installation.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you are using a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path
to run the Setup program. Many programs require that you map a network drive,
and then run the Setup program from that drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

Map a network drive to the share containing the program you want to install, and
then run the Setup program from that drive.
