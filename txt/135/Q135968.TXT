The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95, you see the following message
early in the installation process:

   You can choose not to install Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95, or
   change its destination folder later during Setup.

for certain components later in Setup, you cannot change the destination folder
for Microsoft Plus! as a whole later in Setup.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
