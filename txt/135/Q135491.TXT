KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A multidrop connection is a connection through which one primary computer
communicates with multiple secondary computers. SNA Server supports multidrop
connections to peer or downstream systems on leased SDLC lines. You can
configure up to four multidrop connections on each line, with an SNA server as
the primary server on each.

SNA Server Admin only allows the Multidrop Primary check box to be selected if
the Link Role is Peer (negotiable). It should be set to host (primary) for
multi-drop to work correctly. The Link Role is set in the Connection Properties
dialog box. To get to the Multidrop Primary check box, from the Connection
Properties dialog box, select the Setup button and then the Advanced button.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the file SNAADMIN.EXE to correct this problem.
