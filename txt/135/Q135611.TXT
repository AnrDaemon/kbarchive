TITLE   :FIX: Try to Modify Label Previewed by Another, Calls Converter
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a label form is shared and one workstation attempts to modify the form
while another has run the label in preview mode, the converter is erroneously
called.

WORKAROUND
==========

The error condition is harmless, but you should cancel the Converter dialog box,
and postpone the attempt to modify the label until after the other workstation
has completed previewing the label.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

When the label is modified from the second workstation in Visual FoxPro 5.0, a
"File access is denied" message appears.

MORE INFORMATION
================

While a label form can be both modified and printed simultaneously, attempting
to run the label in preview mode synchronously results in the error "File access
is denied." Unlike the Label Designer, the Report Designer correctly returns
this error when you attempt to modify a report that is already being previewed
by another. In all cases, previewing must be completed before a label or report
can be shared again in any other operation.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. On one workstation, create a label, and issue this command:

      LABEL FORM <labelname> PREVIEW

2. On the second workstation, connect to the same directory in which the label
   was created, and attempt to modify it:

      MODIFY LABEL <labelname>

3. Choose Cancel when the Converter dialog box appears.
