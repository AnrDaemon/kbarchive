TITLE   :PRB: "Record is out of Range" w/ Form from One-to-Many Wizard
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using a form created with the One-to-Many Wizard, you may receive the error
"Record out of Range." This error occurs if a new record is added to both the
parent and child tables.

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs because the record pointer in the child table does appear to be
in the correct location when the command THISFORM.REFRESH is executed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Refresh the form before adding the record in the second table by adding this
line of code:

      * Add record to parent table
      IF INLIST(oAddRec.AddOption,OPT_ADD_PARENT,OPT_ADD_BOTH)
         IF EMPTY(m.cPapaKey)
            APPEND BLANK IN (m.cPapaAlias)
         ELSE
            INSERT INTO (m.cPapaAlias) ((oAddRec.KeyField)) ;
               VALUES(oAddRec.KeyValue)
         ENDIF
      ENDIF

      THISFORM.REFRESH  && < ---- Add this line to fix the problem

      * Add child record
        IF INLIST(oAddRec.AddOption,OPT_ADD_CHILD,OPT_ADD_BOTH)
      * Need to check
           IF EMPTY(m.cChildKey) OR TYPE(m.cChildKey)#TYPE('oAddRec.KeyValue')
              APPEND BLANK IN (m.cChildAlias)
           ELSE
              INSERT INTO (m.cChildAlias) ((m.cChildKey)) ;
                 VALUES(oAddRec.KeyValue)
           ENDIF
        ENDIF

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
