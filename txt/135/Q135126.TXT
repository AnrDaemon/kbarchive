SYMPTOMS
========

On your computer running Windows NT Workstation, if you attempt to start the
Windows NT administrative tools Server Manager and User Manager for Domains from
within the Systems Management Server Administrator, the following error message
appears:

   Unable to start the <administrative_tool>. SMS either cannot connect to
   the remote machine or the <administrative_tool> is not in your path.

where <administrative_tool> is either Server Manager or User Manager for
Domains, depending on which program you attempt to start.

Other Windows NT administrative tools operate properly when started within
Systems Management Server Administrator.

CAUSE
=====

The program files for Server Manager (Srvmgr.exe) and for User Manager for
Domains (Usrmgr.exe) do not exist on your computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, copy the following program and help files to your
%SystemRoot%\System32 subfolder:

 - Usrmgr.exe

 - Usrmgr.hlp (User Manager for Domains help file)

 - Srvmgr.exe

 - Srvmgr.hlp (Server Manager help file)

NOTE: You can obtain these files from the following sources:

 - A computer running Windows NT Server.

 - The Windows NT Server CD-ROM (NOTE: Files are in compressed format and need
   to be expanded before you can run the programs).

 - The Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit CD-ROM.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
