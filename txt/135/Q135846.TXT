SUMMARY
=======

Using the MAP command or Session utility may produce unexpected results from a
Windows NT client running Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) or Gateway Services
for Netware (GSNW).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although the MAP command is listed as a supported utility in the Services for
NetWare Networks guide, not all features of this command function as expected
from a Windows NT client.

When run under the 32 bit command processor CMD.EXE, the MAP command does not
maintain the directory structure specified in the command. For example, MAP
T:=SYS:\PUBLIC should map drive T: to the SYS volume and set the current
directory as T:\PUBLIC. However, after issuing the MAP command and attem ting to
access the drive, the current directory will be reset to the root of the drive.
This behavior does not occur when running the MAP command under the 16 bit
command processor COMMAND.COM.

The MAP ROOT command will produce correct results when run under either command
processor. For example, MAP ROOT T:=SYS:\PUBLIC correctly maps the root of T: to
SYS:\PUBLIC.

Using the Session utility can also produce incorrect results. When you map a
drive in Session you get the following prompt:

   Do you want to map root this drive?

Even if you answer no, it will still MAP ROOT the drive.
