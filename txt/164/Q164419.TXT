SYMPTOMS
========

After running DirectX 3.0 Setup, you may receive the following error message:

   DirectXSetup failed().  -8

CAUSE
=====

You ran the DirectX 3.0 self-extracting archive file (Directx.exe) without the
-d switch, or you ran Directx.exe in a folder with a long file name.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correctly install DirectX 3.0 using the self-extracting archive file, use the
following steps:

1. Create a new folder named Dxsetup on the hard disk.

2. Download the DirectX 3.0 update program (Directx.exe) to the Dxsetup folder.

3. At a command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after each line
   cd <drive>:\<folder> directx.exe -d where <drive> is the
   drive containing the folder you created in step 1, and <folder> is the
   name of the folder you created in step 1. The -d switch extracts the DirectX
   Setup files into the proper folders for running the DirectX Setup program.

4. Start the installer by typing: setup.exe

After Setup is finished, you can delete the temporary folder you created in step
1 if you want.
