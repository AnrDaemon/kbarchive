The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the updated Chkntfs.exe from Service Pack 3 to disable AUTOCHK on FAT
partitions at restart.

The following command now signifies the partition as being FAT when run against a
FAT partition:

   CHKNTFS /x DRIVE:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Chkntfs.exe is a utility included in Service Pack 2 that can be used to schedule
and stop the running of AUTOCHK on a partition during startup.

The original intent of CHKNTFS was to exclude only the NTFS volumes. (FAT volumes
are small and do not take very long to check compared to large NTFS volumes.)

Additional query words: prodnt chkdsk
