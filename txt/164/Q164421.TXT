-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes one criteria that Microsoft Schedule+ 7.0 uses to
determine whether or not to synchronize your local schedule file with the
schedule file on the network when you exit Microsoft Schedule+.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Schedule+ will only synchronize on exit if the time interval you
specified in the "Synchronize Every n Minutes" has expired. For example, if you
set this interval to five minutes, start and then exit Microsoft Schedule+
before five minutes has elapsed, the schedules are not synchronized. In
contrast, if you leave Microsoft Schedule+ open for five minutes or longer, the
schedules will be synchronized. This is done to optimize the Schedule+ process
of logging on and off of the mail system. If you need to synchronize your
schedule before the elapsed time, click the Synchronize Now button on the
Synchronize tab in the Options dialog box (Tools menu).
