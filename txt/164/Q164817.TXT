KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbProgramming kbdta word8 kbwordvba word97

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to set both of the AddPicture properties--LinkToFile and
SaveWithDocument--to False, the following error message appears:

   Run time error 4120 - Bad Parameter

CAUSE
=====

You cannot set both LinkToFile and SaveWithDocument to False.

The following example Visual Basic for Applications command causes the error
described in the "Symptoms" section of this article to occur:

      ChangeFileOpenDirectory _
         "C:\MyPics\"
      Selection.InlineShapes.AddPicture FileName:= _
         "My Picture.Gif", LinkToFile:=False, _
            SaveWithDocument:=False

To work around this problem, set LinkToFile equal to False, or set
SaveWithDocument equal to False, but not both. For example:

To link to the picture file:

      ChangeFileOpenDirectory _
         "C:\MyPics\"
      Selection.InlineShapes.AddPicture FileName:= _
         "My Picture.Gif", LinkToFile:=True, _
            SaveWithDocument:=False

To save the picture file with the document:

      ChangeFileOpenDirectory _
         "C:\MyPics\"
      Selection.InlineShapes.AddPicture FileName:= _
         "My Picture.Gif", LinkToFile:=False, _
            SaveWithDocument:=True

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
