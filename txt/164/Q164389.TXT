TITLE   :FIX: ODBC Files Get Copied to Distribution Disks in VFP 3.0

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When leaving the ODBC Drivers check box blank in step 2 of the Setup Wizard in
Visual FoxPro 3.0, the desired effect is to avoid having the ODBC files copied
to the disk images. The problem is that some of the ODBC files get copied to the
disk images even if the ODBC check box is clear.

There are at least seven files that get copied onto the disk images. They are
listed below:

 - Odbccp32.dl_

 - Odbcinst.dl_

 - Odbcint.dl_

 - Odbckey.dl_

 - Odbcstf.dl_

 - Odbcstp.dl_

 - Odbcexec.ex_

RESOLUTION
==========

To ensure that these files do not get copied onto the disk images, complete the
following steps:

1. Delete the Visual FoxPro \Distrib directory.

2. Open the Compress.dbf table in the Visual FoxPro \Distrib.src directory and
   make a backup of it.

3. Create an index on the DEST field. Locate Odbc.dl_ in the DEST field. Move
   the record pointer to that record.

4. Issue the following command in the Command window:

      DELETE NEXT 52

   Browse the table to make sure that only names that start with OD in the DEST
   field are marked for deletion. There might be more than 52 records that start
   with OD. If so, mark them for deletion also.

5. Now that the ODBC files are marked for deletion in the Compress table, pack
   the table and close it.

6. Delete the Compress and Disk images directories under the destination
   directory if they have been created from an earlier session of the Setup
   Wizard. Also delete the Dkcontrl.dbf, Dkcontrl.cdx, and Wzsetup.ini files
   located in the directory where the source files are.

7. Run the Setup Wizard to rebuild the Visual FoxPro \Distrib directory and the
   Disk images directories. Note that opening up each of the disk images shows
   that there are no ODBC files now.

8. Open the Setup.st1 file in the DISK1 directory with Notepad and place a
   semicolon at the beginning of any line that represents an ODBC file. The
   semicolon acts as a remark statement allowing the setup routine to bypass
   that line. This step has to be repeated every time the Disk images are
   re-created.

To be able to change back to checking the ODBC drivers check box in the Setup
Wizard and loading the ODBC files into the Disk images directories, replace the
Compress.dbf file in the Visual FoxPro \Distrib.src directory with the backup
that was created and delete the Visual FoxPro \Distrib directory. Running the
Setup wizard re-creates the Distrib directory and add the ODBC files to the Disk
images.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an .exe file and place it in a directory by itself.

2. Run the Setup Wizard on that directory and leave the ODBC drivers check box
   clear.

3. Open each of the Disk images directories and note that the ODBC files listed
   above are in the directories.

4. Perform the steps in the WORKAROUND section to remove the ODBC files from the
   disk images directories.
