SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 2 includes a new feature, DHCP Logging. This
activity log feature creates a text log file of all DHCP server activity.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable this feature, perform the following steps:

1. Go to DHCP Manager.

2. Select the DHCP server that you want to enable logging on.

3. On the Server menu, click Properties.

4. Click to select the Enable DHCP Logging check box.


The path to the log file is Windir%\System32\Dhcp\Dhcpsrv.log. When the activity
log feature is enabled, this file will be kept open by DHCP server while the
server is running. To delete the activity log file, you must first stop the DHCP
Server service by typing the following at a command prompt:

   NET STOP DHCPSERVER

If available disk space becomes low, the activity log will pause until sufficient
disk space becomes available to continue.

You must also stop and restart the DHCP Service after enabling or disabling
Logging, Superscopes, or DHCP Decline support.
