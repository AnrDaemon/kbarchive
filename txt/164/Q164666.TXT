SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows 95 you may receive the following error message:

   While initializing device IOS
   A Windows Protection Error occurred.
   You need to restart your computer.

CAUSE
=====

You may have a Quantum Bigfoot hard disk that requires a BIOS upgrade to work
properly with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 or 2.1.

RESOLUTION
==========

Quantum Bigfoot hard disks that meet both the following criteria are confirmed
by Quantum to exhibit the behavior described in this article:

 - Part number: P/N BFxx011-Rev03-D

 - A serial number ending in "S"

If you have one of these hard disks, you need to update the hard disk BIOS. You
can obtain the update from your local dealer or from Quantum. To determine if
your hard disk meets the criteria listed above, contact your dealer or Quantum.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that the error message does not occur if you boot to MS-DOS prior to
starting Windows 95. You may also be able to boot to Safe mode after receiving
the error message, shut down, and then restart Windows 95 normally without an
error message. The error message occurs only in a cold boot situation.
