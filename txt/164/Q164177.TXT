TITLE   :XFOR: Error 2410 When Starting the MSMI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Mail Connector Interchange (MSMI), you may receive
the following event:

   Event ID: 2410
   Type: Error
   Source: MSExchangeMSMI
   Category: Session Error
   Description:

   MS Mail Connector Interchange has failed to establish a session
   with the Directory services. The return code is 0x105.

CAUSE
=====

The MSMI cannot establish a session with the Exchange directory service. The
MSMI still starts and appears to run, but it will not deliver any mail. This
occurs if the System Account is selected instead of the Exchange service
account.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, check the startup parameters for the MSMI. Make sure
"This Account" is selected in the Log On As box and the Exchange service account
is selected.

To verify this:

1. Open Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Services icon.

3. Double-click the Microsoft Mail Connector Interchange service.

4. Verify that the Exchange service account is listed as the startup account.
