======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Calling typeid with a temporary object causes the following error:

   fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR (compiler file
   'd:\backend\src\P2\main.c', line 413)

   Please choose the Technical Support command on the Visual C++ Help menu, or
   open the Technical Support help file for more information

   Error executing cl.exe.

RESOLUTION
==========

Instead of calling typeid with a temporary object, create a stack object and
then call typeid, referencing the stack object.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code
-----------

      /* Compile options needed: none
      */ 

      #include <typeinfo>

      struct X {
         X() {};
         ~X() {};
      };

      // This main function will cause the error.
      void main()
      {
          const type_info& t = typeid(X());
      }

      // For the workaround, replace main above with the following:
      void main()
      {
          X y;
          const type_info& t = typeid(y);
      }
