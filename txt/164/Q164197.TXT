======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following article provides instructions for removing the custom clip art
pictures that have been added to Creative Writer's Picture Picker. The custom
clip art pictures are the pictures listed under the My Clipart category in the
Picture Picker.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remove the clip art pictures from the Picture Picker, do the following:

1. Double-click My Computer, and then double-click the C Drive (where C is the
   drive letter that Creative Writer is installed on).

2. Double-click the Program Files folder, and then double-click the Microsoft
   Kids folder.

3. Double-click the Common Files folder, and then double-click the Shared
   Content folder.

4. Locate and delete the following files :

   User.ath
   User.mth
   User.tth

5. Reinstall Creative Writer and select the option to Setup Again when prompted.

The custom clip art pictures listed under the My Clipart category in the Picture
Picker will no longer be available. You will need to add new custom clip art
pictures to create a new list.

Note: There is not a separate file created for each user in Creative Writer, this
is true even if you log on to your computer at the beginning of a Windows
session. Therefore, when you remove the custom clip art, you remove it for all
users.
