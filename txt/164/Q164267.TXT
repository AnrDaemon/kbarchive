TITLE   :NTFS May Cause Windows NT to Fail During a Rename
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

NTFS can cause a system to fail during a rename. The STOP message will vary, but
the most common is STOP 0x0000000A.

CAUSE
=====

Under certain circumstances, a code path can be executed twice during a rename.
When this happens, NTFS calculates the buffer for the file name incorrectly and
tries to copy 4 GB of RAM. The system will STOP with varying messages, depending
on what memory is overwritten and what else is running on the system.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5x.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
