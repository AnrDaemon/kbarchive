MORE INFORMATION

A profile contains a specific set of information services. When you install the
Microsoft Exchange Client, you must create a profile, unless your administrator
has created one for you.

If you have created additional profiles for other configurations, you can select
which profile you want to use each time you start the client or you can start
the client with a specific profile.

To select a profile when starting the Microsoft Exchange Client:

1. On the Tools menu in the Viewer, click Options, and then select the General
   tab.

2. Under "When Starting Microsoft Exchange," select one of the following:

    - To automatically use a specific profile each time you start the client,
      select Always Use This Profile, and then select the profile name in the
      list below.

    - To be prompted to choose the profile you want to use each time you start
      the client, select Prompt For A Profile To Be Used.

3. Click OK.
