TITLE   :SMS: Upgrading Windows NT with PCM Service May Constantly Repeat
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcmkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When run from the Package Command Manager (PCM) service (Pcmsvc32.exe), the
Ntencap.exe utility, which is used in conjunction with Windows NT operating
system upgrades, is unable to detect that a system is shutting down and
restarting. As a result, the mandatory job never has a chance to be marked
complete (it is actually marked failed by Ntencap). The next time the PCM
service starts, it attempts to run the same package again.

Therefore, all operating system upgrade jobs requiring a shut down and restart of
client computers running the PCM service under Windows NT constantly repeat.

CAUSE
=====

Ntencap.exe waits to receive a shut down message. However, when running in a
service context, Ntencap.exe never receives that shut down message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
