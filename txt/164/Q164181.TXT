SUMMARY
=======

There may be a few cases where you would like to send the information in a
Microsoft Exchange form to another user without having the graphics of the form
displayed when reading the form. For these cases you can create a textized
Microsoft Exchange form that will only send the text of the form, this may be
useful if you were sending the form to a user on a Macintosh that cannot read
the graphical form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

So, how can I create a custom form with EFD and tell the form that the message
to be transferred should be in a plain text format? This can be done by sending
the form as an IPM.Note message class. Following these steps will achieve that
functionality:

1. While creating the form in the Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer
   (EFD), open the View menu and select Window Properties.

2. Click the Menus tab.

3. Click File in the Menu drop down.

4. Click Send in the Commands window.

5. A button for Submit Option will now be available. Click this button to get a
   dialog box for Submit options.

6. Select Other in the Submit By dialog and choose IPM.Note.

7. Check the checkbox Show Fields as Text in the Message.

The following is an example of a textized donation form sent as IPM.Note message
class:

   To: John Doe
   Cc:
   Subject: Donation sent as text

   Charity: Main Street Theatre
   Amount: $100.00
   [ ] Matching Contribution
   [X] Annual Payroll Deduction
   Special Considerations:
   This is the text entered into the Special Consideration text box.
