TITLE   :3270 Print Session May Stop Responding in Spooling Status
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a system with 80 or more 3270 printer sessions configured, 3270 print
sessions may stop responding with a "Spooling" status and fail to recover after
receiving large 3270 printer jobs.

CAUSE
=====

On busy systems, the 3270 Print Server (3270PPD) may run out of internal message
control blocks. If they do run out, it causes the print sessions to stop
responding and not recover.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With the hotfix, the
SNA Server 3270 Print Server message control block handling has been extended to
prevent control block buffer shortages.


The updated module is:

   <snaroot>\system\Ppd3270.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
