TITLE   :Print Jobs Do Not Print Through Office Vision 400
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Print jobs created using Office Vision 400 will not print until the print
session is cycled on and then off.

What happens is that the print job sits at the WTR status until the print session
in SNA Manager is recycled, at which time the job prints normally.

CAUSE
=====

There was a problem in Ppd5250.exe that has now been fixed. The print subsystem
was sending back a response with a zero-length RU, which made the AS/400 give
the print subsystem direction again (because it was expecting a proper
response). Ppd5250.exe then gave the AS/400 direction, but it still had the
zero-length RU. So the AS/400 returned direction back again, and this process
repeated over and over.


RESOLUTION
==========

A fix is available to correct this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
