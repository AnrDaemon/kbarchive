SYMPTOMS
========

If the database driver's SQLSetConnectAttr function call fails during a
SQLConnect or a SQLDriverConnect function call, the driver manager returns
SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO and SQLSTATE IM006. However, no information from the
database driver is returned on why SQLSetConnectAttr failed. In contrast,
SQLBrowseConnect returns SQLError along with the error message from the driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When SQLConnect or SQLDriverConnect is called and the database driver has not
been loaded, the Driver Manager loads the driver and calls SQLAllocHandle. If
connection attributes were specified, the driver manager then calls
SQLSetConnectAttr in the driver. However, if the driver's SQLSetConnectAttr
function fails, the Driver Manager returns SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO and SQLSTATE
IM006 for the connection function, while the error message from the driver is
lost.
