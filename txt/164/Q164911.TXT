TITLE   :Improve SNA Manager Handling of Host Security Domain Deletion
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a host security domain is deleted using SNA Server Manager, the Windows NT
Server group account for the domain remains active. There are no observable
consequences of this problem, however, it will not be clear to the Windows NT
Server account administrator that the host security domain group is still being
used with host account synchronization.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server Manager was only removing the host security domain from the SNA
Server configuration file, though no changes are made to the Window NT Server
group account.

NOTE: The registry entries associated with this host security domain are not
removed, because SNA Server Manager does not know which computers contain the
domain entries for the SNA Host Account Synchronization service
(SNAHOSTPROCESS).

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available which corrects this problem. When a
host security domain is removed, SNA Server Manager now disables the Windows NT
group account associated with the host security domain.

The following module has been updated:

   <Snaroot>\System\Hostproc.exe


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
