DOCUMENT:Q164934  13-JUN-2001  [sna]
TITLE   :Error When 16-Bit Application Accesses a File in a Shared Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a 16-bit application running on the computer running SNA Server to
open a file on a drive that was created by the SNA Server 3.0 Shared Folders
Gateway (SFGW), you may receive the following error message:

   Cannot access <filename>.

CAUSE
=====

The application is trying to access a file object that is still in the SFGW file
object cache. In this situation, the application was allowed to try to open the
file object as a directory. However, because the file object points to a file,
this attempt fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. As a workaround, you
can either try a 32-bit version of the application, or do not run the
application on the computer running SNA Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
