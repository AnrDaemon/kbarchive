TITLE   :Windows NT Client: Primary/Secondary WINS Servers Switch
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows NT client has a primary and a secondary WINS server assigned, it
may unnecessarily switch the secondary server to primary server.

CAUSE
=====

Normally, a workstation should only move the secondary WINS server into the
primary role if the primary WINS server does not respond to repeated name
registration or name query attempts. However, a problem with Netbt.sys causes
some workstations to switch when doing normal name refreshes.

This switch can cause unnecessary wide area network (WAN) traffic if the WINS
server defined as primary is a local computer, and the one defined as secondary
is a remote computer or across a WAN link.

RESOLUTION
==========

A new version of Netbt.sys has been created that no longer exhibits this
problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the Following word in
