SYMPTOMS
========

When you issue a query, the abstract shows HTML code instead of useful data.

CAUSE
=====

If an HTML file is filtered, but it does not have an .html, .htm, .asp, .htx
file extension, then the file will not be filtered with the HTML file filter.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

NOTE: These registry entries are ONLY FOR HTML files.

Using the registry editor, create a file association for the file type under
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. Create a key for the file extension, and place the following
values in the key.

Name: (Default) <-- Note that this entry is blank
String Value = "htmlfile"

Name: Content Type
String Value = "text/html"
