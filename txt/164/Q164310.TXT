SUMMARY
=======

The following is a brief summary of the available Microsoft Exchange Server
application program interfaces (API's) and what they are generally used for.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Messaging Application Programming (MAPI) SDK.
This is the messaging client and transport side API for Microsoft Exchange
Server. The MAPI SDK includes Simple MAPI, CMC (Common Mail Calls) and Extended
MAPI for C\C++ languages, as well as OLE Messaging 1.0 and Active Messaging 1.1
for the Microsoft Visual Basic language. Both 16 and 32 bit platforms are
supported.

Availability:
Available with the Microsoft Win32 SDK.

More information on the MAPI SDK can be found at:

   http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?URL=/library/psdk/mapi/intro_69k7.htm

Microsoft Exchange Installable Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM) driver:
This is an ISAM driver for use with Microsoft Access 97. This driver works on top
of MAPI using Data Access Objects (DAO) code and, is therefore, a messaging
client\transport side driver (not a direct "hook" into the Microsoft Exchange
database). However, it does offer the developer an alternative to writing
messaging applications in C\C++ or Microsoft Visual Basic.

Availability:
Available as the Data Access Pak with the ValuPak for the Microsoft Office '97
Professional Edition.

Microsoft Exchange Development Kit (EDK):
This is the server side API to Microsoft Exchange Server. The EDK is typically
used to develop messaging gateways to Microsoft Exchange Server, mailbox agents
(custom rule processing), and add-in applications (applications that do not use
a mailbox for communication to the Microsoft Exchange Server).

Availability:
Available with the Microsoft BackOffice SDK or MSDN Platform SDK.
