TITLE   :SMS: Database Does Not Reflect Site/Domain Changes Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDatabase kbInventory smsinv smsdatabasekbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Systems Management Server client moves from one site to another in the
same Systems Management Server hierarchy, the client's inventory information
does not always follow them to the new site and domain combination. Generally,
when a client moves from a parent site down to a child site, the database
reflects the move correctly. However, when the client either moves from a child
site to a parent site, or moves in a "horizontal" fashion, the client's
inventory information may be duplicated between the multiple sites.

WORKAROUND
==========

For those cases where the client's inventory is duplicated, it is necessary to
manually delete the old client record from each site's database.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
