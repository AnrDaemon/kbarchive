The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Applications that use remote procedure calls (RPCs) may fail when they attempt
to communicate over a remote access service (RAS) link between two computers
running Windows NT 4.0 using the NetBEUI protocol.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Binding Analysis in the Network Control Panel
incorrectly writes the LANA Registry parameters for Dial-Out modems.
Additionally, the RPC components fail to attempt to connect over the other
LANAs.


RESOLUTION
==========

Install the hotfix noted below, or update to the latest service pack for Windows
NT 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
