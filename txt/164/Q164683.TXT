SYMPTOMS
========

When you clear the Use Country And Area Code check box in the properties of one
Dial-Up Networking connectoid, you may need to manually enter the number you are
dialing for other connectoids.

CAUSE
=====

Clearing the Use Country And Area Code check box in one Dial-Up Networking
connectoid may disable the feature for all other Dial-Up Networking connectoids.

RESOLUTION
==========

Enable the Use Country And Area Code option in all connectoids. TAPI removes the
country and area code when it is not required.

MORE INFORMATION
================

RAS does not use TAPI to format the dialing string if the Use Country And Area
Code check box is cleared.
