TITLE   :Conner 4mm DAT Tape Devices Fail After About 30 Seconds
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have a Conner 4 mm DAT tape device and after about 30 seconds your backup
application returns a hardware error.

CAUSE
=====

Because some of the newer Conner 4mm DAT tape drives hold the busy status for
more than 30 seconds, the driver assumes the device is no longer functioning.
This causes the miniport driver to return an incorrect value for GetTapeStatus.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the updated Tape.sys file and check with the manufacturer of your tape
device that you have the latest firmware revision.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
