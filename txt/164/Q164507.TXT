TITLE   :Any User Can Log on to FTP Server with Disabled Anonymous Logon
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbusagekbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT 4.0 FTP server can be accessed by any user when the anonymous logon
is disabled.


CAUSE
=====

The profile name, IUSR_COMPUTERNAME, does not require a password.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are 2 resolutions to this issue:

1. Set up the user, IUSR_COMPUTERNAME, with a password in User Manager for
   Domains.

   Because an anonymous logon is not allowed, putting a password on this account
   will not affect anything but an anonymous logon. This user account is set up
   specifically for Internet Server Anonymous Logon.

   NOTE: If you change the password for this account in User Manager for Domains
   AND you have a World Wide Web Server on the same computer, you will need to
   run Internet Service Manager. Double-click the WWW service, and change the
   Anonymous Logon Password for the IUSR_COMPUTERNAME user to what you changed
   it to in User Manager for Domains. This way, users that connect to your WWW
   Server anonymously can get access to the page.

   -or-

2. Apply the hotfix mentioned in this article.
