TITLE   :Briefcase May Take a Long Time to Update
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the briefcase on a workstation with files that reside on a network
drive, it may take a very long time to update the status of the files within the
briefcase window opened by Explorer.

Additionally, the CPU usage may go up to 100 percent until the status of all
files has been updated.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if a large number of files in the briefcase (usually greater
than 200) reside on the server.

Note that a briefcase on Windows 95 with the same files will not take as long to
update.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
