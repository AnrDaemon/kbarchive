SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a macro that contains code using the WordBasic Object in Visual
Basic for Applications, you may receive two similar errors. One error is a
Visual Basic for Applications error, and the other error is a WordBasic error.

CAUSE
=====

article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft

The duplicate or similar errors are the result of using the WordBasic Object to
call WordBasic commands within a Visual Basic for Applications environment. In
certain situations, if an error occurs, you will receive a Visual Basic for
Applications error and a WordBasic error.

Furthermore, if the error number returned is greater than 1000, the WordBasic
error cannot be trapped.

The following converted WordBasic macro example, when run in Visual Basic for
Applications, will create duplicate errors if the file name you are attempting
to open does not exist. The On Error statement will trap the Visual Basic for
Applications error but it cannot trap the resulting WordBasic error. If you
comment the On Error command line, two errors will occur when you attempt to
open the non-existent file: "Microsoft Word error 1078" and "Microsoft Visual
Basic run time error 1078."

      Sub MAIN()
         Dim MissingFile$
         On Error Resume Next
         MissingFile$ = "Macintosh HD:NoFile"
         WordBasic.FileOpen Name:=Chr(34) + MissingFile$ + Chr(34)
      End Sub
