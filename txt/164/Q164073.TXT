TITLE   :ASP Queries When SSL Enabled Gives Incomplete Results or Errors
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::1.0,3.0,3.01
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.01 for Windows NT 4.0 
 - Microsoft Active Server Pages, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you do an ODBC query to a database using Active Server Pages (ASP), or you
run a large ASP file while security is enabled using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
you may receive incomplete results or random errors may be generated in Internet
Explorer.

This behavior is random. You may be able to run the query with all records
reported, but when you click refresh in the browser window the symptoms
mentioned in the preceding paragraph may occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) on the Internet Information Server
   computer.

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ W3SVC\ASP\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Modify to change the following entry:

      Value Name: BufferingOn
      Value:      1
 

4. Exit Registry Editor. You do not need to restart the computer for the change
   to take effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The BufferingOn flag controls whether Active Server Pages buffers output to a
browser. If the flag is on (set to 1, rather than the default value of 0) then
all output is collected before any is sent to the browser. This allows HTTP
headers to be set from anywhere within a script. The Response.Buffer method can
be used to override this default setting. Changing the BufferingOn setting does
not require you to stop and restart the Web server for the change to take
effect.
