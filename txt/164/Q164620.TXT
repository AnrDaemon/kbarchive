SUMMARY
=======

The ActiveX Calendar Control provides a way of displaying calendar-related
events on a Web. ActiveX Controls may be combined to add greater functionality
to your Web pages than would be possible with a single control.

NOTE: Microsoft Office 97 installs the ActiveX Calendar Control. If you do not
have Microsoft Office installed, the Calendar Control may not appear in the Pick
A Control list.

MORE INFORMATION
================

ActiveX Controls are a suite of products and technologies that support Web
development and enable software components to interact with one another. ActiveX
Controls are built on the Component Object Model.

For more information about ActiveX Controls, please see the following Microsoft
World Wide Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/com/tech/ActiveX.asp

For more information about Visual Basic Scripting, please see the following

The following example displays the date you selected in a message box.

1. Open a Web page in FrontPage Editor.

2. On the Insert menu, click Script.

3. Click VBScript and click OK.

4. On the Insert menu, point to Other Components, and then click ActiveX
   Control.

5. In the Pick A Control list, click Calendar Control.

6. In the Name box, type the name you want to use for this control. For example,
   type "Calendar1" (without the quotation marks). Click OK.

7. Right-click the Calendar Control object, and then click Script Wizard.

   The Script Wizard appears. It is divided into three panes: the Event pane
   (left side), the Action pane (right side), and the Script pane (bottom).

8. In the Script Wizard dialog box, click Code View.

9. In the Event pane, double-click the Calendar1 icon. Select the Click event.

10. In the Action pane, double-click the Window icon. Double-click the Alert
   icon.

   The following code appears in the Script pane:

          Sub Calendar1_Click()
          call window.alert(msg)

11. In the Script pane, delete "msg" (without the quotation marks). With the
   insertion point between the parentheses, double-click the Calendar1 icon in
   the Action pane, and then double-click Value. The code should now look like
   this:

          Sub Calendar1_Click()
          call window.alert(Calendar1.Value)

12. Click OK.

When you view the page in a Web browser that supports ActiveX controls and you
click a date on the calendar, a message box appears.
