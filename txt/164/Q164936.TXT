TITLE   :Shared Folders Gateway Creates Incorrect Drive & Share Info.
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server 3.0 shared folders gateway (SFGW) service may try to share out
folders from multiple AS/400's with the same share name. It may also try to
create multiple drives with the same drive letter.

CAUSE
=====

SFGW does not check to determine whether the share name and drive letter are
unique when folders are set up from multiple AS/400's. When sharing multiple
folders from a single system, share names and drive letters are correct.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix is available to correct this problem.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
