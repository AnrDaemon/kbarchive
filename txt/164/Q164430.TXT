TITLE   :Access Denied When Saving Event Log
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51 SP5,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 SP5, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 SP5, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to save the Event Log as part of the Clear All Events procedure,
and select a network drive as the destination, you will receive an access denied
error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

Instead of saving the Event Log as part of the Clear All Events procedure, use
Save As from the Log menu to save the Event Log, and then use Clear All Events
to delete the events without using the save option.

Alternatively, on a computer running Windows NT 3.51, replace the Eventlog.dll
file installed by Service Pack 5 with the Eventlog.dll file from Service Pack 4
and restart the computer to resolve the problem. This procedure can be
accomplished by the following steps:

1. In the SYSTEM32 directory, rename the Eventlog.dll file to Eventlog.sp5.

2. Copy the Eventlog.dll file from Service Pack 4 to the SYSTEM32 directory.

3. Shut down and restart the computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 and
4.0.
