OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetupkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2 SP1, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Client Configuration Manager service does not prompt a client computer
running Windows NT to restart in order for the updates to the Systems Management
Server Remote Control Keyboard Driver to take effect.

Changes to the Systems Management Server Remote Control Keyboard Driver service
(kbstuff.sys) have made it a boot-time driver. For the service to work properly,
you must restart the client computer running Windows NT.


WORKAROUND
----------

After either applying Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 1 or manually
updating the Systems Management Server Remote Control Keyboard Driver, shut down
and restart the computer running Windows NT.

STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server version
1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
