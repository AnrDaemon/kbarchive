The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Access 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The first time you access a menu or toolbar, the response is slower than
expected. Thereafter, when you access the menu or toolbar, the response is
immediate.

CAUSE
=====

When you access a menu for the first time, the program must initiate or
"enumerate" all of its menus (which makes the response time slower). However, a
program needs to do this only once per session. Therefore, the second time you
access a menu, the response time is faster.

Different programs have different menu structures and different ways of achieving
this menu initiation. This is why some programs have faster response time when
you first click a menu.
