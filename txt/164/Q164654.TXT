======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a Systems Management Server client's inventory, the SystemRole value (in the
Identification group) may be defined as either "Workstation" or "WorkStation".
When you run a query against SystemRole looking for all workstations, it only
returns clients matching one of these values.

CAUSE
=====

The 16-bit inventory agent (Invdos.exe) contains a reference to "WorkStation",
where the letter "S" is capitalized.

WORKAROUND
==========

When performing a query against the SystemRole value to locate all workstations,
include two statements: one to reference "Workstation" and the other to
reference "WorkStation". Be sure to connect the two query statements with an OR
so that all possible workstations will be returned.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Systems Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
