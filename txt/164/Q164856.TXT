TITLE   :XCON: MTA Fails to Pick Up DN of Servers with Similar Site Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you calculate the routing on a server, the Distinguished Name (DN) for
servers in other sites may be missing.

CAUSE
=====

The site names are very similar. For example, suppose you set up three servers
in a manner similar to the following:

   Server1: organization name to Microsoft, site name to test40
   Server2: organization name to Microsoft, site name to test40F
   Server3: organization name to Microsoft, site name to test40G

Connect Server 1 to Server 2 by means of the site connector, and replicate the
directory. Connect Server 2 to Server 3 by means of the IMC connector, and
replicate the directory.

If you calculate the routing on Server 1, you will notice that the DN is missing
for Server 3. The downstream sites are compared to the local site and there is a
match, so the downstream sites are discarded.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Exchange Server 4.0 and 5.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
