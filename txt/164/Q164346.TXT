TITLE   :XCLN: Newprof.Exe Requires a Value for HomeServer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Newprof.exe is run with the -S parameter, the following error message
appears in the Newprof.exe window:

   Unable to configure message service [Microsoft Exchange Server].
   Deleting service [Microsoft Exchange Server].

CAUSE
=====

The Default.prf file is missing a "homeserver" entry.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add HomeServer=exchange_server_name to the ServiceX section of the default.prf
file (where "X" is the number of the Microsoft Exchange Server section and
exchange_server_name is the user's home Server).

Example:

If the following section exists in the Default.prf file

      [Service List]
      Service1 = Microsoft Exchange Client
      Service2 = Microsoft Exchange Server
      Service3 = Personal Address Book

add Homeserver= to the Service 2 section so it appears as follows:

      [Service2]
      ConversionProhibited=TRUE
      HomeServer=exchangesvr
