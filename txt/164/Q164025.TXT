SYMPTOMS
========

When installing Microsoft Client Services for NetWare (CSNW), the following
error message may appear if the Novell Client32 client software has been
previously installed and removed:

   Please remove any existing Client Services for NetWare components and reboot
   before installing the latest version of Client Services for NetWare.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you may need to make a change to the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor.

2. Navigate to the following locations and make sure the NWCWorkstation key does
   not exist in either place:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\NWCWorkstation

   -and-

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NWCWworkstation

3. If you see the NWCWorkstation key in either of those locations, remove it.
   After it has been removed, CSNW should install successfully. However, if the
   error continues to occur, remove and reinstall NWLink.
