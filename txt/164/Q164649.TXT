The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user attempts to open a 3270 session, SNA Server returns the error
message

   No LU in LU Group Free

even though the LUs appear to be available in the SNA Server Admin or Manager.

CAUSE
=====

When an Open (SSCP) client request is received for a pooled LU that is defined
on an SNA Server connection configured for "incoming-only" activation, SNA
Server treats the connection as though it was disabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix is available to correct this problem.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11, 2.11
Service Pack 1, 2.11 Service Pack 2, and 3.0. This problem was corrected in the
