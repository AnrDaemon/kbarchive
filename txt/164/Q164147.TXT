IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) or Peer
Web Server, you may see the following error message:

   Microsoft Internet Information Server may be installed by another
   process. Please restart your Network Control Panel applet.

CAUSE
=====

This can occur because you are trying to re-install IIS without uninstalling it,
or because you had a failed installation of IIS.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

 - If you are unable to run the uninstall sucessfully, or if you still get the
   error message after running the uninstall program, use the Registry Editor to
   remove the following keys:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\InetMgr
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\InetStp
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\InetSrv

NOTE: Not all of these keys will necessarily be present, but be sure to remove
every one of them that does show up.
