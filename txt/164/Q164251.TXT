KEYWORDS:kbHWMAC kbvfpkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Selecting a blank field type in step 2 of the Table Wizard causes the following
error message:

   Error # 10 in processoutput(0): Syntax error.

In order to get a blank field type, you must scroll to the bottom of the Type
list box and choose the blank entry at the bottom of the list.

The Table Wizard in Visual FoxPro for Windows 5.0 does not have a blank entry in
the Type list box. Therefore, this error does not occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0.

   list, and select the blank field type.

4. Click Finish and save the table.

While saving the table, the error occurs.
