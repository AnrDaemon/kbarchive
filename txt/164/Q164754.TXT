======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server Program Group Control (PGC) application does not
correctly create certain program groups for shared network applications on
client computers running Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation 4.0. These same
program groups are created properly on client computers running Windows 3.1,
Windows for Workgroups 3.1x, or Windows NT Workstation 3.51.

The Pgc.log log file in the client's Ms/Sms/Logs directory contains one or more
of the following entries:

   [date time] Program Group Control ==> Failed to write shortcut

CAUSE
=====

Program Group Control is unable to create shortcut entries that contain invalid
characters for file names. Windows 95 and Windows NT Workstation 4.0 use the
file system to create Start menu program groups and shortcuts. Program groups
are actually folders (directories) and program items are actually link (.lnk)
files.

Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups 3.1x, and Windows NT 3.5x do not create
directories or files to represent program groups or items, and are therefore
unaffected.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not use invalid characters for file names in the program group name when
creating a shared network application program group through the Systems
Management Server Administrator program. The following characters are invalid
for directory and file names:

   backslash        \ 
   slash            / 
   colon            :
   asterisk         *
   question mark    ?
   quotation mark   "
   less than        <
   greater than     >
   pipe             |

You can confirm that no invalid characters are present by viewing the Program
Group Properties window of the Systems Management Server Administrator program
and noting the entry for the 'Name:' field.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
