To work around this problem, do either of the following:

 - After the service pack is applied, shut down and restart the system from the
   console.

 - Use the Package Command Manager executable (Pcmwin32.exe). However, this
   method requires that a user be logged on to the system, in order to start the
   Package Command Manager program.
