TITLE   :XADM: Message Tracking Doesn't Track IMC-bound Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use Message Tracking to track messages sent out over the
Internet Mail Connector (IMC) in Exchange Server 4.0 or the Internet Mail
Service in Exchange Server 5.0 and later, no tracking information can be found.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you use the Standard Edition of Exchange Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable Message Tracking for outbound IMC or Internet Mail Service messages if
you use the Standard Edition of Exchange Server, you must install the Microsoft
Exchange Connector (Site Connector) component. When you do this, the message
transfer agent (MTA) object is exposed in the specific Server's container, and
you can enable Message Tracking on the MTA's general property page in the
Exchange Server Administrator program. This allows you to track inbound and
outbound messages over the IMC and Internet Mail Service.

NOTE: You do not need to actually create a site connector after you install the
Connector Pack. When you install the connector, you enable message tracking on
the IMC or Internet Mail Service.
