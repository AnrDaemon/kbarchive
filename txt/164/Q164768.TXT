TITLE   :XADM: DL Delivery Restriction Fails Without Name Resolution
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An originator of a message who is not a member of a distribution list (DL) can
send e-mail to that DL even if the delivery restriction of the DL is set to
accept messages only from its members. This problem occurs if the originator of
the message does not resolve the DL to a Microsoft Exchange Server DN.

For example, joe@company.com can send e-mail to vp@corporation.com, where vp is a
DL that only allows messages from its members.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
