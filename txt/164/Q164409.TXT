TITLE   :Stop 0x0000000A in Tcpip.sys Caused by Invalid Fragment Bit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A computer running Windows NT may display one of the following blue screen STOP
error messages while it processes a datagram packet:

   STOP 0x0000000A IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

-or-

   STOP 0x00000019 BAD_POOL_HEADER

CAUSE
=====

A router incorrectly set the packet fragmentation bit on a browser broadcast
datagram packet. The Tcpip.sys driver attempts to reassemble this packet and
causes pool memory corruption.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the fix mentioned below. The new Tcpip.sys
driver will now check the length field on the packet to prevent it from
processing fragments that do not exist.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in
