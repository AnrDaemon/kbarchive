PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are performing a shared installation of Windows 95 using an IBM Token
Ring Auto 16/4 ISA network adapter, Windows 95 may not connect to the network
during the real-mode to protected-mode network transition.

CAUSE
=====

IBM Token Ring Auto 16/4 ISA network adapters with a microcode level 000700
PP1FA7 have a Plug and Play BIOS that cannot be disabled using the Lanaid.exe
configuration tool supplied by IBM.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must disable the network adapter's Plug and Play BIOS in order for the
network transition to be successful.

Contact IBM Corporation for more information about this procedure.


MORE INFORMATION
================

In a local installation of Windows 95 with this adapter at this microcode level,
the results are that two IBM Token Ring Auto 16/4 ISA network adapters are
enumerated and listed in Device Manager. One of the devices is listed as not
working. Removing either device prevents the network adapter from working
properly; and on reboot the device is enumerated and listed twice in Device
Manager again.
