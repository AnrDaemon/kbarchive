======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Migration wizard (Mailmig.exe) to migrate users from either
Microsoft Mail or cc:Mail to Microsoft Exchange Server the following error
message may appear:

   The address book is unavailable. Check that the Microsoft Exchange Server is
   still available.

When you checking the Application event log, you may find the following event as
well:

   Event ID: 145
   Source: MSExchangeMig
   Description: Error Configuring the profile for Account: Microsoft System
   Attendant.

CAUSE
=====

During the migration process, it is necessary for the System Attendant to log on
as the users being migrated in order to perform certain tasks such as moving
messages or personal address book entries and so on. In order to log on, the
System Attendant must create a temporary profile and configure that profile. To
create a profile, the migration wizard makes some calls into the Emsui(32).dll,
which by default resides in the %Systemroot%\System(32) directory.

If the user running the migration wizard does not have access to Emsui(32).dll or
access to the directory it resides in, the aforementioned events may be
encountered.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, grant the user running the migration wizard access to
Emsui(32).dll:

 - Give the user access to the directory where Emsui(32).dll resides.

   -OR-

 - Copy Emsui(32).dll to the directory where Mailmig.exe is (by default, this is
   in the Exchsrvr\Bin directory)
