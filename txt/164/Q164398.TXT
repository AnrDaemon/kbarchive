KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under high stress, a computer running Windows NT Server may get a Blue Screen
with a STOP 0x0000001e KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED message.


CAUSE
=====

If a TDI transport provider indicates an event after the connection is aborted,
AFD accesses a stale connection structure.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With the hotfix, AFD
was changed to prevent dereferencing the connection structure twice.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.

This problem was corrected in SP3.
