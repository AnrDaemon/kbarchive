TITLE   :WD97: "Change Text Direction" Button Shows Incorrect Direction
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbui kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the text direction in a text box or table cell, the Change Text
Direction button shows the text direction incorrectly.

CAUSE
=====

The purpose of the button face is to show the position of the text after you
click the button. This functionality is by design in Word.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Word, you can rotate text in a text box or table cell without having to use
WordArt (as you did in previous versions of Word).

On either the Tables and Borders toolbar or the Text Box toolbar, Word provides a
Change Text Direction button. The purpose of this button is to rotate the text
into one of three predefined directions, and the button reflects the next
direction of the text if you were to click the button again.

NOTE: The Change Text Direction button does not indicate the current direction of
text, nor can you add a different text direction for use with the Change Text
Direction button.
