TITLE   :XCLN: Message Marked Private Can't Be Edited
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.0; WINDOWS:5.0; Win95:5.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows 95, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you read a message in Microsoft Exchange Client that was sent to you with
its sensitivity set to Private, you cannot edit the text of the original message
when you forward it to someone else.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The forwarded message will maintain its private status.

If you have an Inbox Assistant rule set to auto-forward messages, a private
message will not be forwarded unless you do the following:

1. On the Tools menu, click Inbox Assistant.

2. Set the rule, then click the Advanced button.

3. Select the Sensitivity check box and select Private.

This will forward the private messages only. You need to set another rule in
order to forward other messages.

This is not foolproof and should not be used as a security procedure because the
recipient of the message can always copy all of the text and paste it into
another message and then forward it to someone. It just forces a recipient to
think about it before forwarding it.
