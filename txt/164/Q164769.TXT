TITLE   :UDCONFIG Displays Wrong User Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When starting the Host Account Manager (UDCONFIG) to set the user's password in
the SNA Server host account cache, Host Account Manager may show the incorrect
domain in the Windows NT User Name field that indicates the currently logged on
user. If this User Name is not a member of the host security domain group, the
Host Account Manager also displays the following error:

   You do not have sufficient privilege

CAUSE
=====

The Host Account Manager attempts to look up the local SID for the user. If a
user is logged on to a Windows NT Server domain account from a Windows NT Member
Server, and attempts to run Host Account Manager, the local account is used for
the lookup, instead of the domain account.

You are more likely to encounter this problem when using common account names
(such as Administrator) that exist within the Windows NT Server domain as well
as on member servers.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix is available to correct this problem.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
