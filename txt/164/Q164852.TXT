TITLE   :XCON: Attachments from HP OpenDesk May Not Open
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you send mail with an attachment from Hewlett Packard (HP) OpenDesk mail to a
computer running Microsoft Exchange Server through the X.400 connector (1984),
the Microsoft Exchange Server recipient (on the same server as the X.400
connector) receives a message with an attachment of the correct name. However,
when the user clicks the attachment to open it, he or she may get an error
message reporting "This file does not have a program associated with it." The
title bar of the message shows that the file it is attempting to open is
c:\Temp\Att.dat. The error occurs even if you have an association for the file
extension of the attachment.

CAUSE
=====

HP OpenDesk message is malformed. It does not include the file name in the
"pathname" attribute, as specified by the Electronic Messaging Association (see
the MORE INFORMATION section of this article). The following is the incoming
message in ASN.1 format:

   0000

   0000

No PathName is present, so the Microsoft Exchange Server MTA cannot apply a
proper attachment name for display. The fix supplied by Microsoft (see the
STATUS section of this article) treats the user-visible string as the file name
(in the example above, the user-visible string is the "DescriptiveIdentifier
GraphicString" attribute).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, save the attachments as files before opening them.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Exchange Server 4.0 and 5.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base

MORE INFORMATION
================

The standards reference for File Transfer Body Part (FTBP) usage is from the
Electronic Messaging Association (EMA), Message Attachment Work Group File
Transfer Body Part Feasibility Project Guide, v.1.5.2, June 1996.

The following is an excerpt from section 5, File Transfer Body Part 15 Profile,
describing where the filename is supposed to go :

                               O  R    Notes
   File-Transfer-Body-Part
   FileTransferParameters
   Environment
   user-visible-string            R  M    note 3
   File-Attributes
   pathname                   R  M    note 4

   O - Origination, R - Reception
   R - recommended, M - mandatory

   Notes

   3. User-Visible-String
   This element should be used to convey any additional distinguishing
   information that might be of use to the receiver, eg. for presentation to a
   user or in cases where the application-reference is not recognized by the
   receiving system.

   4. Pathname
   If generated, the incomplete-pathname should be used. The SEQUENCE should only
   consist of a single GRAPHIC-STRING element containing the target
   file/attachment name without any preceding path information.
