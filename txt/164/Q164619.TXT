-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194278.

SYMPTOMS
========

The popular clipart that is installed with Office 97 cannot be previewed in
FrontPage Editor.

CAUSE
=====

The popular clipart that is installed with Office 97 is in the Windows Metafile
(WMF) format. FrontPage Editor can only display JPG and GIF images; it does not
have the ability to display WMF files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To insert the WMF files in FrontPage Editor, follow these steps:

1. On the Insert menu, click Image, and then click the Other Location tab.

2. Click Browse, select the WMF file, and then click Open.

NOTE: Office 97 clipart is installed in the \Program Files\Microsoft
Office\Clipart folder by default.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The most common image file formats for use on the Web are Graphics InterChange
Format (GIF) and Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPG). Although some Web
browsers do support some additional graphics formats, formats such as WMF are
not widely supported. To ensure that visitors to your site can view your images,
you should avoid using non-supported images on your Web pages.
