SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Write-up feature in PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0, on
a computer that contains both Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0 or 7.0a
and Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, Write-up starts Word 97 and then stops
responding (hangs). When you switch back to PowerPoint, you receive the
following error message:

   Word Error.
   This command is unavailable while there is an active Word section in the
   Binder.

To start the Write-up feature in PowerPoint 7.0, click Write-up on the Tools
menu.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you have both Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
or 7.0a and Microsoft Word 97 for Windows on your computer and you are using the
Write-up command from PowerPoint 7.0. This problem does not occur if you are
using PowerPoint 97.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, start Word 7.0 or 7.0a before you use the Write-up
command in PowerPoint 7.0.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
