TITLE   :Can't Browse Virtual Directories on NetWare Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WinNt:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a virtual directory that points to a volume on a Novell NetWare
server, you cannot browse the contents of that directory. Instead, you receive
the following error:

   HTTP/1.0 500 Server Error (The system cannot find the path specified.)

CAUSE
=====

If you enable a default document on the WWW properties page in Internet Service
Manager and have a virtual directory on a Novell NetWare server, this error
occurs when you access that directory, even though directory browsing is
enabled.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - In Internet Service Manager, do NOT specify a default document for the Web
   server. If you do not specify a default document type, you can browse the
   virtual directory on the Web server.

   -or-

 - Make sure a file with the exact name of the default document exists in the
   virtual directory on the NetWare server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
versions 2.0 and 3.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
