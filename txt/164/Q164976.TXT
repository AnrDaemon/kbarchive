TITLE   :XADM: Encrypted Msgs Can't Be Forwarded w/ Inbox Rule
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Messages that are encrypted using Advanced Security do not get forwarded
automatically, even though you have an inbox rule set up to forward the message
to another recipient or to a public folder.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. Messages that are encrypted with Microsoft Exchange Server
Advanced Security have a flag set on them that prevents them from being
auto-forwarded; therefore, the inbox rule process ignores any incoming encrypted
messages and does not forward them.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - Manually forward any encrypted messages to the desired recipients and/or
   public folders.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Messages that are only digitally signed (not encrypted) will get forwarded
automatically by inbox rules if the rule applies to the message.
