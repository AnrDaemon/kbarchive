PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.1,4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbide kbVC kbVC500fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply custom build rules separately to multiple project configurations
and you select more than one of those configurations in the Project Settings
dialog box, the custom build rules disappear if the rules are not exactly same.
If you click OK to close the Project Settings dialog box, you lose the custom
build.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0, and
Visual J++ version 1.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Developer Studio Build Settings, create custom build rules for the project
   separately for debug and release.

2. In the project settings dialog box, select both projects (release and debug).

3. Click OK to exit the Project Settings dialog box.

Go back to the Project Settings dialog box and verify that the build rules were
not saved (the custom build rules will not be exactly same for both debug and
release).

In summary, if custom build rules have already been applied separately to files
or configurations within the project settings dialog box and the custom build
settings are viewed with these items selected, the custom build settings appear
blank if they are not exactly the same as the selected items. If you click OK at
this time, or you choose a different settings page and click OK without changing
the selection of items, the custom build rules for the selected items are lost.
If you move to another settings page, change the selection of items, and click
OK, the custom build rules for each item that was selected on both the custom
build settings page and the current page are lost.
