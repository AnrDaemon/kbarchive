PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::1,2,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw osr2 win95 kbHardwarekbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some computers are equipped with power management features that place the
computer in a suspended power state after a certain period of inactivity. If the
Auto Insert Notification option is enabled for IDE CD-ROM drives on such a
computer, and the computer uses the Intel PIIX 3 IDE controller chip set, the
computer may not be suspended automatically.

CAUSE
=====

The drive polling that Windows performs to determine drive status is detected by
the power management components as drive activity. The drive controller reports
that the drive is still in use, preventing the computer from being suspended.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that this issue affects computers that use the Intel PIIX 3 IDE controller
chip set, and does not depend upon whether the drive itself supports a
particular Media Status Notification specification.
