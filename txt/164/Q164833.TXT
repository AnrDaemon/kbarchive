TITLE   :XADM: EDBUTIL and ISINTEG Fail to Complete on Corrupted Store
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the Information Store becomes corrupted, you may see the following
symptoms:

 - The store reaches a high percentage of utilization (for example, 70 percent).

 - Currently logged on users will see their clients freeze.

 - When you run ISINTEG on the Information Store, it stops responding midway
   through processing and remains that way. The utility fails.

 - When you run EDBUTIL /C /ISPRIV, it also stops responding and may indicate
   which table the problem occurs on.

CAUSE
=====

The internal pages of the table are corrupted. You may or may not be able to
find the exact cause of this corruption.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no workaround. It is recommended that you run a full restore of your
Information Store.

As a last resort, you could use a newer version of EDBUTIL to repair the
corruption.

STATUS
======
