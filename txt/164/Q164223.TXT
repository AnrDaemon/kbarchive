The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1

SYMPTOMS

On certain laptop computers running Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2),
when a PC Card is inserted into a slot in the docking station, the card may not
be recognized.

CAUSE
=====

This symptom has been observed with certain docking stations that use the TI
1130 PCI-to-CardBus bridge, and occurs only when the PC Card is inserted in a
CardBus slot connected through this bridge (that is, in the docking station).

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================


If you are experiencing this behavior, contact your computer manufacturer for a
possible remedy.

If the TI 1130 PCI-to-CardBus bridge is configured as a "positive decode" bridge,
CardBus cards will be recognized but non-CardBus PC Cards (type R2 PCMCIA cards)
may not be recognized.

If the TI 1130 PCI-to-CardBus bridge is configured as a "subtractive decode"
bridge, non-CardBus PC Cards (type R2 PCMCIA cards) will be recognized but
CardBus cards will not be.
