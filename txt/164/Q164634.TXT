TITLE   :SNA Client Fails on SNA Server 3.0 on French WinNT 3.51
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The version of the Security.dll file in Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 French
version, does not support data encryption. The Microsoft SNA version 3.0 client
will fail to work when trying to connect to an SNA 3.0 Server running on the
French version of Microsoft Windows NT Server 3.51. The client connection will
be rejected and an event 722 will be generated in the application event log.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs when encryption is enabled on the SNA Server (even though the
emulator being used does not support it or does not have it checked). It will
only occur if Named Pipes/Microsoft Networking is selected as the client-server
protocol.

NOTE: To enable Data Encryption, the administrator should go to the Properties
page for the appropriate user/group, and then click "Use Client/Server
Encryption" on the User Properties tab.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, disable data encryption support because the underlying
Security.dll does not have this functionality.

The following files have been updated to correct this problem:

   <snaroot>\system\snaserver.exe
   <snaroot>\system\snadmod.dll
   <snaroot>\system\snaevent.dll
   <snaroot>\system\snanw.dll
   <snaroot>\system\snaat.dll
   <snaroot>\system\snabv.dll
   <snaroot>\system\snanb.dll
   <snaroot>\system\snaip.dll
   <snaroot>\system\snalm.dll
   <snaroot>\system\adloc.dll
   <snaroot>\system\snabase.exe
   <snaroot>\system\snacfg.dll
   <snaroot>\system\sfcapi.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
