The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to a share, you may receive a message from the
server stating there is not enough resources or memory to process the command.
Also, Event ID 2018 may appear in the event log.

Analysis shows that the paged pool is not overused and the error looks incorrect.
This problem most likely occurs on multiprocessor computers.

Windows NT does not maintain the memory usage counters properly. Operations on
the counters are not "atomic" while running on multiprocessor systems.

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
