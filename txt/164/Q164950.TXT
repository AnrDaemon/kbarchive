======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - The C Run-Time (CRT), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Motorola has made available a static library, LIBMOTO, which may improve
performance of some PowerPC applications built using Microsoft Visual C++.
Linking with LIBMOTO replaces the following C Runtime Functions:

   * cos                    * pow
   * exp                    * sin
   * log                    * sqrt
   * log10                  * strcmp
   * memcpy                 * strlen
   * memmove                * strncmp

The memory and string functions have been hand-tuned in PowerPC assembly language
for high performance. The math functions contain some tables and algorithms that
are proprietary to Motorola. Applications that make heavy use of the above CRT
functions may see an improvement in performance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LIBMOTO was originally released as part of the Motorola C/C++ SDK. Motorola is
making LIBMOTO available as a stand-alone product free of charge to encourage
PowerPC development. LIBMOTO may be downloaded from Motorola's Website at:
