TITLE   :Logon Allowed When Access Denied to Mandatory User Profile
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user of a mandatory profile attempts to log on, but has insufficient
access to read the mandatory user profile, the following message is displayed:

   You do not have permission to access your central profile located at
   \\server\share\username.MAN. The operating system is attempting to log you on
   with your local profile.

The system then proceeds to log the user on with a default profile.

The ability to log on should not be allowed if the mandatory user profile is not
accessible.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in Userenv.dll that causes incorrect handling of Access
Denied error conditions when accessing mandatory user profiles.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, grant users of the mandatory profile appropriate
access rights to it.

Alternatively apply the related hotfix, which fixes this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
