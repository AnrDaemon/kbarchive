TITLE   :XFOR: Embedded Message Wrapping Incorrect with DEC All-In-One
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Problems may occur when you send mail that includes an embedded message to
foreign X.400 MTAs (such as Dec All-In-One) from Microsoft Exchange Server
across a 1984 type X.400 connector. The text of the embedded message wraps
incorrectly (that is, it does not wrap at all). In some circumstances, the text
from the embedded message is unreadable.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you send to the foreign system by means of a hub
Microsoft Exchange Server that is running MTA version 995.24. The messages are
received by the foreign system; however, text cannot be read in the embedded
messages. Rather than being wrapped correctly, the entire text is placed onto
one line.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
