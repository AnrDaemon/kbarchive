The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you perform a GET or CHECKOUT of a Project from the Visual SourceSafe
Explorer, and check the Recursive checkbox, there is an option for Build tree.
The command line equivalent is:

      SS GET *.* -r -gf-

- or -

      SS CHECKOUT *.* -r -gf-

assuming that the current directory is the directory in which you want to build
the directory tree, and that you have set the current project to the project to
be got or checked out.

MORE INFORMATION
================

*.* tells SourceSafe to operate on all the files in the project.

-r specifies that this is a recursive operation. This is the command line
equivalent of checking the Recursive checkbox.

-gf- turns off the Force_Dir initialization variable for this command. When
Force_Dir = No, files in subprojects are copied to subdirectories of the current
directory, which are created programmatically, rather than to their working
directories.

NOTE: If the initialization variable Force_Prj is set to "Yes" (that is, if
"Assume project based on working folder" is checked under the Command line
options menu, under the Options menu, under the Tools menu) and if the current
subdirectory is the working folder for a different SourceSafe project, you may
receive the error "No matching files found" or you may get or check out files
from another project you were not expecting.

Additional query words: folder
