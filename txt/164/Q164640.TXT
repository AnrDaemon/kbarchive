TITLE   :SNA 3.0 Manager Does Not Show APPC/CPI-C Application Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 Manager tool does not display the APPC or CPI-C
application which is using an LU6.2 conversation. The SNA Server 2.x Admin tool
included this functionality.

CAUSE
=====

This functionality was left out of the Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 Manager by
design. This feature has been added to the SNA Server 3.0 Manager tool.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 is available to support this new feature.
The updated module is \<snaroot>\System\Snaole.dll.

The APPC Sessions display for Local and Remote LUs now includes an extra column
for "Exe Name." This is the same information that is available under Active
Users. This column is hidden by default and can be enabled through the View
Columns menu.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
