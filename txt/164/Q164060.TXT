SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Service (IMS) supports Extended Set
of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (ESMTP) commands, however it does not advertise
its support of ESMTP on connect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Hosts that support the Extended Set of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (ESMTP)
respond with the following:

    220-suns.nba.com Sendmail 8.6.12/8.6.9 ready at Wed, 19 Feb 1997
    15:36:48 -0600
    220 ESMTP spoken here

Even though the IMS supports these commands, the IMS response is as follows:

    220 chopper2.wspu.net Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service
    5.0.XXXX.0 ready


The ESMTP commands supported are referenced in RFC1869 and RFC1870.

version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
