======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article applies to DBCS (double byte character set) code pages only.
DBCS code pages include:

   

   290 (Japanese (Katakana))
   930 (Japanese (Extend Katakana))
   931 (Japanese (English-lower))
   933 (Korean)
   935 (Chinese (PRC))
   937 (Chinese (Taiwan))
   939 (Japanese (Extend English))

1. DBCS Characters Incorrect and Multiple Sessions Fail.


2. Multiple Fixes for DBCS SCS Printing.


SYMPTOMS
========

1. DBCS Characters Incorrect and Multiple Sessions Fail.

   SYMPTOMS
   DBCS characters are not printing correctly in both LU1 and LU3 data streams
   and a Dr. Watson log is generated when multiple print sessions are
   activated.

    - DBCS characters are not printed correctly in LU3. ShiftOut(0x0E) and
      ShiftIn(0x0F) are not handled correctly. These codes mark the beginning
      and end of DBCS data. Since these codes are not recognized, DBCS
      characters between SO(0x0E) and SI(0x0F) are printed as two SBCS
      characters.

    - Dr.Watson appears on activations of multiple printer sessions. If only one
      of DBCS code page sessions is activated, the problem does not happen.
      However, if two or more DBCS code page sessions are activated, a Dr.
      Watson log results.

    - DBCS characters are not printed correctly in LU1. If DBCS data is sent
      containing one or more control codes (NL, CR, LF, BS, and so forth), then
      the DBCS data is printed incorrectly.

   RESOLUTION
   A fix has been made to correct these problems.


2. Multiple Fixes for DBCS SCS Printing.

   SYMPTOMS
   There were multiple problems found in SCS DBCS printing. The following
   problems were fixed:

   a. When the margin is set in the Printer Session Properties Printing Tab, the
      resulting position of the grid line is incorrect.

   b. The grid line is incorrect on some control codes.

   c. The automatic LF (Line Feed) is not performed. This automatic LF is a a
      special function for the grid handling (for DBCS code page only).

   d. "-R" is not returned on incomplete Set Attribute (SA) data streams.

   Complete SA format:
   DBCS: 0x'2843xx'
   Grid: 0x'28C2xx'

   Incomplete SA:
   The data chain ends with 0x'28' or 0x'2843' or 0x'28C2'.

   e. NewLine (NL) is not performed after maximum presentation position (MPP).

   f. NUL control code is printed.

   RESOLUTION

   a. The printing position of the grid was adjusted for the margin.

   b. The grid handling after some control codes(including NL, CR, LF, BS) was
      modified.

   c. Corrected the automatic LF process for the grid.

   d. The -R is now set at the end of the data chain, for the incomplete SA
      format.

   e. The NL process was corrected for MPP.

   f. The NUL character was translated to space.

   An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed these to be problems in SNA Server 3.0. This problem was
corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For
