TITLE   :Policy "Path for Manual Update" Support for %LogonServer%
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The "Path for Manual Update" for loading policies from a named server location
does not support the %LogonServer% environment variable.

CAUSE
=====

This functionality was not designed into the base release of Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In a large multiple master domain model, you would ideally use the Automatic
policy update mode. However, in a large environment, the Policy file may become
large, and associated performance problems may ensue. Decentralizing the
policies would overcome the performance issue, but would be unmanageable in a
large environment.

Switching to Manual policy update mode allows you to create policies specific to
each resource domain. This works around the potential performance problems but
introduces a single point of failure, because the Path for Manual Update must be
a hard-coded UNC name to a single specific server location.

Adding support for %LogonServer% in the Path for Manual Update is a better
solution, as it removes the single point of failure (assuming the network has
more than one logon server), and allows policy processing to be distributed
among the logon servers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either accept the single point of failure that choosing Manual policy update
mode for policies entails in the base release, or upgrade to the latest service
pack, which enables %LogonServer% to be used within the specified Path for
Manual Update.

STATUS
======

This feature is included in the latest Microsoft Windows NT version 4.00 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
