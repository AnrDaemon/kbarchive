TITLE   :XADM: Export Populates Addresses Column Randomly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When you perform a directory export in the Exchange Server Administrator
program, in the resulting export file (with the extension .csv) the E-Mail
Addresses column may be populated randomly with the various e-mail address types
for each mailbox, instead of the e-mail address types all being populated in the
same order for each mailbox. This is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an export is performed on Exchange Server, the E-Mail Addresses column of
the export file is, by default, populated with the default Exchange Server
e-mail addresses in the following order:

   MS:<MS Mail address>
   SMTP:<SMTP address>
   X400:<X.400 address>
   CCMAIL:<cc:Mail address> (only in Exchange Server 5.0)

However, if you manually change one of these e-mail addresses for a particular
mailbox on that server using the Exchange Server Administrator program, and then
perform the directory export, the e-mail address types may be populated in a
different order in the E-Mail Addesses column for that mailbox. For example, the
order may be: CCMAIL, then MS, then SMTP, and then X.400.
