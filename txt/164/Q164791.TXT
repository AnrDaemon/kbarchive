TITLE   :SMS: PCM Does Not Disconnect from NetWare Distribution Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcmkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After running a package from Package Command Manager (PCMWIN16.EXE), the client
leaves a drive mapped to the Novell NetWare distribution server. If the servers
have limited licenses, this may cause a problem where all the connections to the
server are being used, and some clients will be unable to make a connection to
the server.

This problem only occurs when the client does not already have an existing
connection to the distribution server that provides the package.


WORKAROUND
----------

To work around this problem, manually delete the mapped drive used by the Package
Command Manager.

STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server version
1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
