TITLE   :Verify Old Passwords Before Updating SNA Host Account Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft SNA Server does not offer a configurable option to verify the old
password in a host-initiated password change before executing the change. This
field is currently ignored. In addition, the SNA Server Host Account Manager
(UDCONFIG.EXE) does not prompt you to enter your old password when updating the
SNA Server host account cache for your account.

CAUSE
=====

This functionality was not implemented in the initial release of SNA Server 3.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

There are two changes implemented in SNA Server Host Security Integration
relating to the handling of old passwords.

1. The ability to require the host to send the correct old host password to SNA
   Server. When the host initiates a password change, the SNA Server host
   security agent will now verify that the old password sent by the host is
   valid for the account if the following registry entry is set:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   \SYSTEM
      \CurrentControlSet
         \Services
            \SNAPmp
               \Parameters   ValidateHostRequest: REG_DWORD: 1

   If enabled, (REG_DWORD=1), the Host must supply the old password for the user
   to apply any changes.

2. Requires user to enter old password in SNA Host Account Manager.The Host
   Account Manager configurator now requires you to enter your old password
   before allowing the password to be updated. The updated modules are:
   <snaroot>\system\hostproc.exe snaroot>\system\snaudb.exe
   <snaroot>\system\snapmp.exe <snaroot>\snafile.stf

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for Microsoft SNA
Server version 3.0. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
