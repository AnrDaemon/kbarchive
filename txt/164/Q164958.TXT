To work around this problem, copy the PTK directory off of the CD to your hard
drive and then run the setup from there.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem does not exist with the SQL Server
Developer Edition included with the Visual C++ 5.0 Enterprise Edition.
