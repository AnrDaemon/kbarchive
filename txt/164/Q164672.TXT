TITLE   :IE Does Not Interpret PERL Scripts Correctly as Plain Text
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are using a PERL script with a header that contains the following:

   Content-Type: text/plain\n\n

In addition, HTML tags exists within the file. Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE)
displays the results as HTML output rather than plain text output. If there are
no HTML tags, the file is viewed as an unsupportable file type and IE tries to
download file.

CAUSE
=====

IE assumes that because the script contains HTML tags that it is an HTML file
and displays it as such regardless of what content type is stating.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Microsoft Internet Explorer
version 3.0 or above. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
