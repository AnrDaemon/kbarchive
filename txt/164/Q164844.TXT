TITLE   :XCLN: Meeting Request Booked on Wrong Calendar If Auto-Forwarded
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0a; winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0a 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT, versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are a delegate who accepts a meeting request, Schedule+ may book the
meeting on your own schedule, rather than the schedule for which you are the
assistant.

CAUSE
=====

Schedule+ users may have meeting requests sent only to their assistant.
Normally, Schedule+ forwards these meeting requests when this option is
selected. However, the message may be corrupted during the forwarding process.

This problem occurs when a Windows NT 32-bit Schedule+ client forwards the
meeting request. The client may corrupt the request message during the
forwarding process.

WORKAROUND
==========

A supported fix is now available; however, it has not been fully regression-
tested and should only be applied to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends
that you wait for the next service pack that contains this fix. Contact
Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
3.51, with service pack SP5. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
