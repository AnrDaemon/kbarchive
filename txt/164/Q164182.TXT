TITLE   :Index Server: Error: 0x2AF9 Occurred While Running Webhits.exe
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT: 1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select a virtual server, you may get the following error message when
you click the Show Highlights hyperlink:

   Error: 0x2AF9 Occurred while running webhits.exe

CAUSE
=====

When Webhits.exe is called, it searches for the /Scripts subdirectory by
default. If a global /Scripts directory (a virtual directory without an
associated IP address) exists, Webhits.exe cannot use it to pull up the
information.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create another /Scripts virtual directory for the virtual server with the same
IP address. Point this /Scripts directory to the same physical location as the
global /Scripts directory.
