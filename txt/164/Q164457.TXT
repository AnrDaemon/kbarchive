-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Messages sent to an Internet domain that contains two or more ending characters
that match the local Microsoft Exchange Server domain may be returned with the
following nondelivery report (NDR):

   Your message did not reach some or all the intended recipients.
      Subject: <subject>
      Sent: (Date/Time>
   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:
      '<Recipient>' on date / time
         The recipient name is not recognized
         MSEXCH:IMC:<ORG>:<Site>:<Server name> 3902 Host Unknown

CAUSE
=====

This NDR occurs if the Internet domain's last two or more characters matches the
local Microsoft Exchange Server domain. Also, the local Microsoft Exchange
Server domain is added to the Internet Mail Connector's "Specify by E-mail
Domain," with delivery set to use DNS.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
