TITLE   :XCON: RETIX Message Does Not Trigger Read Receipt
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message from RETIX OPEN SERVER 1.45 to Microsoft Exchange Server
and you have selected the Read Receipt option, no read receipt is sent from
Microsoft Exchange Server to the RETIX system.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because RETIX requests a read-receipt but no NonReceipt
Notification. This operation is illegal, and currently is treated as "No
Receipt." Therefore, no read receipt is sent.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
