-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Word 97 Help refers to the Tables7.dot template as a source of additional Word
macros for working with a table:

   The macros supplied with Word are stored in templates installed in the Macro
   subfolder of the Word program folder. For example, the template Tables7.dot
   contains a set of sample macros you can use when working with Word tables.

This information is incorrect. Microsoft Word 97 for Windows does not include the
Tables7.dot template.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Word version 7.0 includes a template, Tables7.dot, that contains the following
macros:

 - Access Exporter

 - Table Math

You can use these macros to work with a Word table.

Although Microsoft Word 97 for Windows does not include a macro template, it does
include alternative methods for performing these functions.
