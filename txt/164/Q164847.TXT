TITLE   :XCON: Win95 Client w/ Mail Service Won't Prompt for RAS Callback
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Microsoft Exchange Client on a computer running Windows 95 with a
profile configured to be offline and to use the Microsoft Mail Service, you are
correctly prompted for a callback number the first time you dial up to a RAS
server from your Microsoft Exchange Client.

However, for the next connections, the Microsoft Exchange Client automatically
uses the previous callback number without prompting you to confirm or to modify
the phone number.

This problem may be an issue for field people with laptop computers that run
Microsoft Exchange Client offline and want to use callback functionality from
different locations each time.

This problem only occurs on computers running Windows 95, and not on computers
running Windows NT Workstation.

This problem only occurs with the Microsoft Mail Service, and not when connecting
to a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Exchange Server 4.0 and 5.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
