SUMMARY
=======

For information on using NetMeeting with Microsoft Proxy Server or other
firewalls, please refer to Chapter 4 of the NetMeeting Resource Kit. The
Resource Kit is available at the following URL:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/NetMeeting/Corp/ResKit/default.ASP

The following excerpt from the NetMeeting Resource Kit applies to Microsoft Proxy
Server versions 1.0 and 2.0:

   FIREWALL LIMITATIONS

   Some firewalls cannot support an arbitrary number of virtual internal IP
   addresses, or cannot do so dynamically. With these firewalls, you can
   establish outbound NetMeeting connections from computers inside the firewall
   to computers outside the firewall, and you can use the audio and video
   features of NetMeeting. Other people, though, cannot establish inbound
   connections from outside the firewall to computers inside the firewall.
   Typically, this restriction is due to limitations in the network
   implementation of the firewall.
