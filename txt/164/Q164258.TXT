OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under heavy stress or when restarting during Setup, there can be disk corruption
with a DPT caching SCSI host adapter.

This only happens when the write cache of the DPT adapter is enabled and hardware
level RAID 5 is used.

CAUSE
=====

When there is a reset on the SCSI bus because of a timeout or a system Reset,
the Windows NT driver does not properly handle the uncompleted commands in the
command queue of the DPT adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, contact DPT for an updated version of Dptscsi.sys or
for information on updated firmware. You can contact DPT at:
