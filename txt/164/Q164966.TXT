TITLE   :Print Session Status Remains "Spooling"
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print 3270 print jobs through the SNA Server 3.0 Print Service, the
first job will print successfully, but all other jobs for that printer LU will
stop responding, and the status of the printer will display "Spooling"
indefinitely.

CAUSE
=====

The host sends an initial BID request to open a bracket for the first document
to print. The Host Print Service sends a +RSP, and the job is correctly printed.
If there is a second print job queued on the host when the first job ends, SNA
Server immediately receives a new BID request from the host. But the Host Print
Service never sends any response, so the job stops responding.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix is available to correct this problem.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
