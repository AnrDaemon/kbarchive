SUMMARY
=======

When you looking at the Logon information for a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0
computer that has an Internet Mail Service (IMS) installed and running, you may
see that the IMS has multiple logons.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service was improved in version 5.0 to
allow the service to log on to the store multiple times. This is by-design to
allow the service to handle a higher message flow that may occur with the
addition of POP3 support in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0.The multiple logon
will help prevent any "bottlenecking" that might have occurred during periods of
high usage.
