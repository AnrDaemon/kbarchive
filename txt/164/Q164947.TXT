TITLE   :FIX: Nested Macros Cause Errors C2065 and C2064
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCodeGen kbCompiler

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A nested macro may cause errors similar to the following:

   error C2065: 'MACRO_B' : undeclared identifier

   error C2064: term does not evaluate to a function

   error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before '}'

CAUSE
=====

The second macro is not being expanded correctly. A preprocessed file for the
following sample shows that MACRO_B is not expanded:

         { MACRO_B ("Hello world.\n") };

It should expand to:

         { { printf("Hello world.\n"); } };

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 32-bit Edition,
versions 4.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code
-----------

         /* Compile options needed: none
         */ 

         #include <stdio.h>

         #define MACRO_A(A)      { MACRO_B A }
         #define MACRO_B(A)      { printf(A); }

         void main()
         {
             MACRO_A(("Hello world.\n"));
         }
