SUMMARY
=======

When you configure the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail (CCMC) to
connect to a cc:Mail post office that is located on a NetWare server, you must
ensure that the Microsoft Exchange Server service account has permission to
access the cc:Mail post office database. There are two ways to do this: one is
by setting up Microsoft Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) with the gateway
enabled, and the other is without having the gateway enabled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

GSNW Enabled
------------

When you enable the gateway and re-share the cc:Mail post office as a Windows NT
share, then the Exchange Server service account will use the Gateway's NetWare
access permission to access the cc:Mail post office.

GSNW Disabled
-------------

If you bypass enabling the gateway, then the Exchange Server service account must
also be created on the NetWare server with the identical account information and
password.

For additional information on installing and configuring Microsoft's GSNW on your
computer running Windows NT Server, please see the Windows NT online
documentation and refer to the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge
