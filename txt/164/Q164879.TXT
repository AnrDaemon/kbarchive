TITLE   :SMS: Server Name Not Displayed in Permissions Box
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProgkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Remote Control Agent Permission dialog box on a client does not display the
machine name that initiates the Remote Control session. Remote Control Agent
displays the account name initiating the Remote Control Session, which can be
misleading to the user. Displaying the machine name in addition to the user name
would help identify exactly who is initiating the remote control session.

For example, the dialog box currently displays the following message:

   Will you allow 'SMSAdmin' to Remote Control your machine?

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
