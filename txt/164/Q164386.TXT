TITLE   :Print Disk Administrator Screen to Record Hard Drive Info

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To assist in recovering lost volume sets, extended volume sets, stripe sets, or
fault tolerance sets, customers will call and request advice from engineers on
how to rebuild their hard drive information. Although Microsoft has tools
available that can often aid in rebuilding this information, it is necessary to
obtain vital information about the computer, such as the following examples:

 - In what order were partitions added to the stripe set?

 - What drives are part of the extended volume set?

 - What partitions are actually mirrored?

This article describes procedures to create a printout of the Disk Administrators
Screen so valuable hard drive configuration information is preserved.

NOTE: It is always preferable to save the disk information to a floppy disk by
pointing to configuration and clicking save from the partition menu in Disk
Administrator. The procedures in this article are intended to supplement this
process and not replace it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a print out of the disk administrator screen:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
   click Disk Administrator.

2. Adjust the screen size so as much disk data is as visible as possible.

3. Press and hold down the Ctrl key and then press the Print Scrn key, this will
   place the data on your clipboard.

5. From the Edit menu, select Paste.

6. As desired, crop the image.

7. Print the image to a printer, preferably a color printer, or save the image
   file to a floppy disk for future reference.
