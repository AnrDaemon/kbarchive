======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Plus! for Kids, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use Microsoft Plus! For Kids Protect It! to set access restrictions on
your computer, you will not be able to restrict access to the Network
Neighborhood if the computer is on a network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Plus! For Kids was designed for stand-alone home computers, not for
computers on networks. Therefore, the Network Neighborhood cannot be restricted
using the Protect It! program. Similarly, Dial-Up Networking is not disabled by
Microsoft Plus! For Kids, Protect It!, although a universal modem restriction
can be put in place for a family member.

Even though Protect It! cannot prevent access to the Network Neighborhood, it is
possible to limit access to network shares and set up user-level passwords
through the Network tool located in Control Panel. For more information about
performing these tasks in Windows, see your Windows printed documentation or
online Help.
