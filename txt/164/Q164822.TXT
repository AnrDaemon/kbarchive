TITLE   :SMS: Administrator Program Cannot Find Add-in Tool
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsmsAdmin kbsmsUtil smsadmin smsutilkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Register Add-ins utility to add a menu option to the Tools menu
of the Systems Management Server Administrator program, the application may fail
to run. If the working directory (the location of the application's executable
file) specified for the application is not part of the local PATH variable for
the system, the application fails to run, and you receive the following error:

   Microsoft SMS Administrator

   Can't launch the specified tool.
   Command line: <your application>
   Working Directory:<None>
   Error: The system cannot find the file specified.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server Administrator program does not use the defined
WorkingDir value in the registry. Therefore, if the directory is not specified
in the system PATH variable, the application is not found.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add the directory where the application is located
to the system PATH variable. You can do this through the System Control Panel.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
