TITLE   :Unsuccessful Appletalk Winsock Connection Using WSARECV()
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAPI kbSDKPlatform kbWinsock kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a program that calls the WSARECV() function to communicate with a
Windows NT version 4.0 server over a Winsock connection with the AppleTalk
protocol, the program does not establish a successful connection to the server.
However, when you use the same program to connect to a Windows NT version 3.51
server, the program works correctly.

CAUSE
=====

Programs using a Winsock connection to a Windows NT 4.0 server may require
Winsock 2.0 support. Prior to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3, there are no
provisions for Winsock 2.0 functionality in Windows NT Server 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
