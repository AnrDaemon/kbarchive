SUMMARY
=======

If you use Network Monitor in Systems Management Server version 1.2 or Network
Monitor from the Windows NT Server version 4.0 compact disc, you will not be
able to view Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) or General Routing
Encapsulation (GRE) packets. At the time these products were released, it was
not known what port would be used for PPTP.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view PPTP and GRE packets, follow these steps:

1. In the parsers directory created by Network Monitor, edit the Tcpip.ini file.

2. In this file, find the [TCP_HandoffSet] section.

3. At the bottom of this section, find:

   5678 = PPTP

4. Change 5678 to 1723.

5. Save the file.

When you run Network Monitor, you will now see PPTP session packets, and GRE
packets initiated by PPTP.
