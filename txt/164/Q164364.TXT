TITLE   :Error Adding a Second Printer in Print Manager Defined by Pserv
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Services for NetWare versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Services for NetWare is installed on a backup domain controller (BDC) and a
second logical printer is added and shared from a Novell print server running
Pserver.nlm, you may receive the following message:

   Access Denied.

This happens even if the passwords under File and Print services for NetWare
(FPNW), Print Server in Server Manager and the Print Server Account in User
Manager are left blank or are removed and reset to be the same.

This error even occurs if you follow the steps outlined in the Services for
NetWare Administrator's Guide for version 4.0 page 60, "Setting up a Print
Server to Service a Printer Queue on a Different File Server" exactly.

Event 539 "logon failed..." is recorded in the Security Log of Event Viewer,
indicating that the <print server account> logon was unsuccessful and the
account is locked out.

CAUSE
=====

FPNW is installed on a BDC, but not on the primary domain controller (PDC) of
the domain.
