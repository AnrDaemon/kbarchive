TITLE   :Computer Name Truncated When Name Resolution Attempted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAPI kbSDKPlatform kbNetAPI kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When name resolution for the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) is required over
any of the installed network protocols bound to NetBIOS, and the PDC's machine
name is 14 characters or longer, the name queries truncate the computer name to
13 characters, and a negative response occurs. As a result, you may experience
one or more of the following:

 - Extra network traffic

 - Long response time with some domain operations

 - Administrative Tools unusable

 - Unable to change domain passwords

Name queries that are formatted for broadcast, WINS, and DNS are all affected by
this problem.

CAUSE
=====

The NetGetDCName Win32 API is used to retrieve the name of the PDC on a domain.
If the PDC s name is greater than 13 characters, this API caches the local PDC
name incorrectly. If a second call is made, NetGetDCName tries to connect to
this invalid PDC name, causing extra network traffic and a longer response
time.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
