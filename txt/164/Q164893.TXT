======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0 
 - Microsoft SNA Workstation, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Windows NT or Windows 95 SNA Server Client on a system that has
SNA Server or SNA Workstation installed, Setup may overwrite existing SNA Server
files and registry parameters, and cause both applications to fail.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program for the Windows NT and Windows 95 SNA Server client does not
check for the existence of SNA Server or SNA Workstation during the installation
process.

The SNA Server software and the Windows NT and Windows 95 SNA Server client use
the same file names and several of the same registry entries. The Windows NT SNA
Server client and SNA Server also use the same default installation path
(C:\Sna). The default installation path for the Windows 95 SNA Server client is
C:\Sna95.

RESOLUTION
==========

To easily work around this problem, do not install the Windows NT or Windows 95
SNA Server clients on the same system as SNA Server or SNA Workstation.

The Setup programs for Windows NT and Windows 95 SNA Server 3.0 clients have been
updated to check for a previous installation of SNA Server or SNA Workstation
prior to beginning the installation process. Setup will fail if either SNA
Server or SNA Workstation is detected.

The updated modules are:

   \<snaroot>\Snasetup.dll
   \<snaroot>\Setup\Client\Snasetup.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0, 2.1,
2.11. and 3.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
