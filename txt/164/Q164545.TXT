TITLE   :ErrMsg: The Directory Name Is Invalid
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Pipe I/O redirection command ("|" without the quotes) in a batch
file or in an MS-DOS session from within Windows NT, the following error may
occur:

   The directory name is invalid.

CAUSE
=====

The environment size value for the Comspec variable was explicitly set to a
value greater than 2048.

For example:

Under System Variables, the value for Comspec appears as follows:

   ComSpec %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe /e:xxxx

Where %SystemRoot% will be the drive and directory name where NT is installed,
and xxxx is a value equal to or greater than 2048.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the following:

 - Remove the /e:xxxx switch from the Comspec environment variable.

   The ComSpec environment variable is dynamic for Windows. Removing the /e:
   switch and its value may allow proper execution of the command.

   -or-

 - Use the redirection symbol (">" (without the quotation marks)) to perform
   the equivalent command.

   Example:

   DIR *.* | MORE <enter>

   This command is equivalent to

   DIR *.* > PIPE0 <enter>
   MORE < PIPE0 <enter>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 and 4.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
