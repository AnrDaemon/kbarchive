======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to execute a stored procedure of a database from within a form, the
following error message appears:

   File '<procedure name>' does not exist

The user can choose to Cancel, Suspend, Ignore, or get Help. This appears to only
happen when the stored procedure is not in the currently selected database.

RESOLUTION
==========

You may do either of the following to resolve this issue:

 - Issue an OPEN DATABASE <database name> command in the Load Event of the
   form.

   -or-

 - Issue SET DATABASE TO <database name> in the Init Event of the form.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. Stored procedures may only be called when the
database is the active, or selected, database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a database, and add a table and a Stored Procedure to it.

2. Create a form, and add the table to the Data Environment.

3. Drag the table onto the form to create a Grid.

4. Add a command button to the form, and in the Click Event call the stored
   procedure. (Ensure that the DBC is closed prior to running the form.)

5. When the error is returned, click Ignore and on the Standard Toolbar click
   the DBC. Note the procedure is called successfully.
