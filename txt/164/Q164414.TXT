TITLE   :FIX: MSDEV Error: "The Requested Topic Does Not Exist"
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVC420bug kbVC600fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Visual C++ 4.2 over version 4.1 and then run Developer Studio,
the following error message may appear:

   The requested topic does not exist. The title is in error.

CAUSE
=====

This happens because the registry key (should be all on one line):

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SoftwareMicrosoftInfoViewer\Titles\VCBKS40.MVB\LastTopic

has the last topic from Visual C++ 4.1 which is invalid in 4.2.

This problem occurs in this release because the same book name is used in both
Visual C++ 4.2 and 4.1.

RESOLUTION
==========

 - Use the help system once in Visual C++ 4.2. This overwrites the registry key.
   Exit and run Developer Studio again. The error does not occur.

-or-

 - The error message is harmless and can be ignored.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. The problem was corrected in Visual C 6.0.
