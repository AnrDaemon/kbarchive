TITLE   :XCLN: Microsoft Mail Address Book Not Displayed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Client with an MSMail Service installed may not display the
complete list of Microsoft Mail networks and postoffices when you view the
address book. This happens when the Microsoft Mail Network.glb file is corrupted
or a specific .xtn file is corrupted with duplicate entries for the same network
or postoffice definition.

When you scroll through the address book, the list does not display any further
than the duplicate network or postoffice definition. When viewing with the
Microsoft Mail 3.5 client, all networks and postoffices are available.

The corruption is due to a duplicate Network or postoffice definition in
Network.glb or a specific .xtn file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Because the entry is duplicate, the .xtn file will still be divisible by 698
bytes. If an .xtn or Network.glb file is corrupted, perform the following step:

 - Send the access (Access.*) files, the .xtn files, and the Network.glb file to
   Microsoft Technical Support (MTS).

A support professional can verify information in the XTN files, or Network.glb,
correct the record, and return your file to you.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
