TITLE   :Removing FPNW from a PDC Causes Loss of Netware Compatible Login
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Services for NetWare versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) is installed on a primary domain
controller (PDC) and must be removed and reinstalled, the NetWare Compatible
Login properties of all such domain users will be lost unless a backup domain
controller (BDC) is present in the domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To avoid losing those properties, perform the following steps:

1. Verify that a BDC exists in the domain, and that it has FPNW installed.

2. Before removing FPNW from the PDC, temporarily promote the BDC to a PDC to
   retain the user properties.

3. After FPNW has been successfully removed and reinstalled on the BDC (the
   former PDC), promote it back to PDC.
