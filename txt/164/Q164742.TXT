TITLE   :PRB: Error Message Cannot Load 32-bit DLL
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.0 3.0b 5.0 6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbtool kbvfp kbvfp300 kbvfp300b kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error occurs when you attempt to call a function in a 16-bit DLL
that has been registered with the DECLARE-DLL command:

   Cannot load 32-bit DLL <path to DLL>

It may also seem to happen in calling the RegFn() function in FoxTools, if the
incorrect syntax is used, after having registered the function with the
DECLARE-DLL command.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. The DECLARE-DLL command should only be used to
register 32-bit DLL functions in FoxPro. To register a function of a 16- bit
DLL, use the RegFn function of the FoxTools.FLL library.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following steps are for illustration purposes only -- the DLL in the example
does not exist.

Type the following commands in the command window:

      DECLARE INTEGER TestFn IN Test16.dll INTEGER,INTEGER
      *** The error will occur on executing the next line of code
      ? TestFn(1,1)
      *** Removing the asterisk on the next line would resolve the error
      *** that occurs on the first RegFn() call below.
      * CLEAR DLLS

      SET LIBRARY TO HOME()+"FoxTools.FLL"
      *** The error will occur on executing the next line of code
      *** because it is attempting to call the TestFn() function registered
      *** above with the DECLARE-DLL command
      handle = RegFn(TestFn(),"II","I","Test16.DLL")
      * The correct way to register the function is...
      handle = RegFn("TestFn","II","I","Test16.DLL")
      ReturnValue = CallFn(handle, 1, 1)  && Note this works now
