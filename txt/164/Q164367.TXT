TITLE   :BUG: Report Writer Selects Objects After Printing in Designer
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When printing a report from the Report Writer Designer, the report is sent to
the printer as expected. All of the objects in the report, however, are selected
in the Report Writer Designer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Any actions to refresh the Report Writer Designer such as minimizing the report,
minimizing Visual FoxPro, or bringing up another window in another application
restore the report objects' correct, visual state.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The visual state of the objects "selected" status is now reversed; those objects
that appear to be "selected" are not. If you "deselect" an object, you are
actually "selecting" it in a functional way, although you are not getting the
correct visual cue.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a quick report using the Employee table in the \Vfp\Samples\Data
   folder.

2. Click Print on the Report Writer Designer toolbar.

NOTE: The report is sent to the printer. All of the objects in the Report Writer
Designer, however, will be "selected."
