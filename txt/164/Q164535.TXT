TITLE   :Random Errors w/ IDC or ASP Queries to Access Database
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following random errors when performing Internet Database
Connector (IDC) or Active Server Pages (ASP) queries to an Access database:

 - CreateObject errors when using ASP sample pages

 - Errors in Inetinfo.exe at random memory addresses

 - After executing the query, the browser appears to stop responding

CAUSE
=====

This can occur when the Winnt folder does not have write permissions set for the
IUSR_servername account.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create System Environment variables for both TMP
and TEMP with the value %SystemDrive%\TEMP, as shown below:

1. In Control Panel System, click the Environment tab.

2. Select a variable in the System Variables box.

3. In the Variable box, select the current variable name and type TMP (or TEMP).

4. Click Set.

5. In the Value box, type:

   " %SystemDrive%\TEMP " (without the quotation marks)

6. Click Set.

7. Close Control Panel and restart the computer.

NOTE: If you are not allowing anonymous authentication, and instead using Basic
or NT Challenge response, you must give the write permission for the Winnt
folder to individual users or groups.
