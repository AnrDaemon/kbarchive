PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the X.400 connector over the TP4 protocol stack to connect a
Microsoft Exchange Server computer to another e-mail system, the following
warning message may be generated in the Windows NT Application log:

   Event ID 9215     MSExchangeMTA     Operating System

   A sockets error 10022 on a connect() call was detected. The MTA will
   attempt to recover the sockets connection. Control block index: 21.
   [BASE IL TP4 DRIVER   10 273] (12)

Sockets error 10022 is defined as "Invalid Arguments." As a result of this
warning, the message you wanted to send does not leave the queue.

CAUSE
=====

When setting up the X.400 Connector using TP4, the remote message transfer agent
(MTA) address needs to be defined on the X.400 Connector properties Stack tab.
This value can be either hexadecimal or text and must match the value defined in
the remote MTA. If this value does not match, it generates the invalid argument
error and the association to the remote MTA is not made.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - Check the settings for the remote MTA and make sure that the address defined
   on the Stack tab of the Exchange X.400 connector matches the NSAP address of
   the remote MTA.
