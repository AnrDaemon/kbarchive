PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In SNA Server Manager, if you click Link Service on the Insert menu to add the
IBM DFT Link Service, you receive the following message:

   Link Service Error

   This link service cannot be configured using the SNA Server Manager.
   To configure this link service, run the External Link Services tool
   from the Tools Menu.

CAUSE
=====

The IBM DFT Link Service was not written so that it could be fully integrated
into the SNA Server Manager program when SNA Server 3.0 was released.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use the External Link Services tool to install the
IBM DFT Link Service.

The IBM DFT Link Service has been updated so that it is now fully integrated into
SNA Server Manager so that it can be added using the Insert -> Link Service
option with Manager. The updated files are:

   <snaroot>\setup\server\snafile.stf
   <snaroot>\setup\server\snafile.inf
   <snaroot>\system\hwsetup\ibmdft\ibmdfcfg.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
