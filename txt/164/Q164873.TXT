KEYWORDS:kbhw osr2 win95 kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) is installed on your computer, some
PCI devices may not be configured properly. Device Manager may display an
exclamation point in a yellow circle next to the devices, with text stating that
the driver did not load or the driver is incorrect for the hardware. The
Resources tab may display an IRQ resource without assigned memory resources.

The same device may be configured correctly in Windows 95 or Windows 95 OEM
Service Release 1.

CAUSE
=====

If the PCI device does not request any memory resources in its first Base
Address register (BAR0), the remaining Base Address registers may not be decoded
properly. The requested resources may not be assigned, and the device may not
function.


RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
