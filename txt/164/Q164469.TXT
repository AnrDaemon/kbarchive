TITLE   :XFOR: Scheduled X.400 Connector Doesn't Initiate Connection
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up a Microsoft Exchange Server X.400 connector with a scheduled
connection every 15 minutes, and the other site of this connector is Remote
Initiated, there is no association initiated for this connector when the
scheduled time is due, if there is no message queued up at the scheduled site of
this 400 connector. Because the other site is Remote Initiated, even if there is
a message on this site, the message cannot be delivered.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the Remote Initiated site to Selected Times.

STATUS
======
