The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you remove the Host Security Integration service (by using the SNA Server
Setup program), the SNA Server service fails to start, and you receive the
following error message:

   SNARPC.DLL Not Found

CAUSE
=====

The Host Security Integration service removal program causes the Snarpc.dll file
to be removed. This file is used by other SNA Server services that fail to start
if the file is not found.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem. The updated
module is:

   <Snaroot>\Snafile.stf

Snafile.stf is a script file that is used by the SNA Server Setup program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
