KEYWORDS:kbhw osr2 win95 kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On certain laptop computers running Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2),
when a PC Card is inserted into a slot in the docking station while another slot
in the docking station is occupied by a PC Card, the newly inserted PC Card may
not be recognized.

CAUSE
=====

This symptom has been observed with certain docking stations that use the TI
1130 PCI-to-CardBus bridge, and occurs only when the PC Card is inserted into a
CardBus slot connected through this bridge (that is, in the docking station).

STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This symptom may occur regardless of whether the PCI-to-CardBus bridge in the
docking station is configured as a "positive decode" or a "subtractive decode"
bridge.


If you are experiencing this symptom, contact your computer manufacturer for a
possible remedy.
