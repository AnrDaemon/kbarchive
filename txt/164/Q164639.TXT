TITLE   :SNA Windows 95 Fails Logon If Password Change Required
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SYMPTOMS
========

If the Windows NT Server 4.0 user account is configured to require the user to
change the password at the next logon attempt, and the SNA Server Windows 95
client is configured to use a non-named pipe transport, the SNA Server Windows
95 client logon will report a logon failure.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT logon security mechanism used by the SNA Server Windows 95 client
does not support the change password feature.


RESOLUTION
==========

An update to Windows NT Server 4.0 (included in Service Pack 3), adds support
for Change Password notification. In addition to this change, SNA Server 3.0 and
the Windows 95 SNA 3.0 client have been modified to use this new notification
feature.

The following updated SNA Server modules are available:

   SNA Server

     \<snaroot>\System\Snadmod.dll   \<snaroot>\System\Snaevent.dll

   Windows 95 SNA Client

     \<windir>\System\Snakrnl.dll   \<windir>\System\Snabase.exe

NOTE: Windows NT Server 3.51 and SNA Server 2.11 do not support change password
notification needed by the SNA Server Windows 95 client. The updated version of
Windows NT Server 4.0 must be used with SNA Server 3.0 (on the server and
Windows 95 client) in order to support this feature.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
