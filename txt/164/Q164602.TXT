TITLE   :SMS: Ending a Remote Control Session Leaves Open Handles
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProgkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When opening a remote control session with a client computer running Windows NT,
multiple handles are opened on the Windows NT client. Upon closing the remote
session, four handles are left open. Each time a session is opened and closed,
the number of open handles increases by four.

Additionally, there is a small memory leak in the Working Set memory used by the
process.

Both resource leaks are very slow, and only affect systems that are remote
controlled very frequently and are restarted rarely.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, stop and restart the Systems Management Server
Remote Control Agent service (Wuser32.exe). Doing this returns the reserved
resources back to the operating system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
