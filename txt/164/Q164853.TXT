TITLE   :XADM: Incorrect Spanish on Microsoft Exchange Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you only upgrade your Spanish client to Microsoft Exchange Client 5.0 and not
the Spanish Microsoft Exchange Server, the server store will not be localized
for new mailboxes, because Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 has no support for
Spanish Modern.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 (Mdbsz.dll) is stamped as Spanish traditional, and
Microsoft Exchange Client 5.0 is language stamped as Spanish Modern (in line
with all other Spanish Microsoft products).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With the hotfix,
support for Spanish Modern has been added to Spanish Microsoft Exchange Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
