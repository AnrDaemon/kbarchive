PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Greek input locale, accented Greek characters are not being
created correctly.

CAUSE
=====

When you select a specific input locale in the Keyboard dialog box in Control
Panel, Windows NT uses this setting to select a code page that it uses to map
keyboard input to characters. The incorrect Greek character problem is caused by
an incorrect codepage being used; codepage 869 is used when Windows NT should be
using codepage 737.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix to Keyboard.sys has been provided by Microsoft that corrects the codepage
usage.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
