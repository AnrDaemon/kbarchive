-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) has been enhanced to
provide additional diagnostic information in the case of a fatal MTA
database error. When a fatal database error occurs, Mta*.dmp files are
created in the Mtadata subdirectory.

This feature has been added to MTA version 995.45 and later. It is
included in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

The Mta*.dmp files and any Db*.dat files, event logs, text event logs, and
failure dump files can be used by Microsoft for analysis of a problem.
