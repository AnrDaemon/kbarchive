TITLE   :Play Button Unavailable When CD is Reinserted in CD-ROM Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbtool kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are playing an audio CD, if you eject the CD using the button in CD
Player or the eject button on the CD-ROM drive and then reinsert the CD, the
Play button may remain unavailable.

If you stop playing the CD in CD Player, eject it with the button on the CD-ROM
drive, and then reinsert the same CD, the Play button works normally. However,
if you do this and insert a different CD, the Play button is available, but does
nothing when you click it.

NOTE: When any CD is reinserted, CD Player may seem to read the CD (the light may
blink on the CD-ROM drive) but the behavior described above still occurs.

CAUSE
=====

The Autorun feature in Windows NT 4.0 has been disabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

Stopping and restarting the CD Player program makes the Play button work
correctly again.

If the Autorun feature has been disabled, enabling it also resolves the issue.
