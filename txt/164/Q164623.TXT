SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Visual Basic for Applications Reset property to reset an OLE
Word document object inserted as an inline shape back to the original size prior
to re-scaling, the object is not reset as expected.

CAUSE
=====

Each time the object is resized, the scaling factor is automatically reset to
100 percent and the new size becomes the original size.

The following example Visual Basic for Applications macro creates a new Word
document, inserts a Word document object, re-scales the document object, and
then resets the document object to its original size:

      Sub ResetOleShape()
         ' Create variables.
         Dim sOriginalHeight, sOriginalWidth As Integer
         ' Add a new blank document.
         Documents.Add
         ActiveDocument.Content.Collapse wdStart
         ' Create the document object.
         Set oInlineShape = ActiveDocument.InlineShapes.AddOLEObject _
         (Range:=ActiveDocument.Content, DisplayAsIcon:=False, _
         ClassType:="Word.Document.8", LinkToFile:=False)
         ' Add text to embedded document.
         ActiveDocument.Content.InsertAfter "Text in Embedded Document."
         ' Close out of embedded document return to source document.
         ActiveDocument.Close
         ' Store the original object size.
         sOriginalHeight = ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).Height
         sOriginalWidth = ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).Width
         ' Scale the object to a different size(for testing.)
         ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).Height = 100
         ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).Width = 100
         ' Reset the object to it's original size.
         MsgBox "OLE object has been resized. Click OK to reset."
         ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).Height = sOriginalHeight
         ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).Width = sOriginalWidth
      End Sub
