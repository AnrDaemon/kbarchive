TITLE   :Not All Objects Are Displayed When Browsing NDS Trees
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) or Gateway Services for
NetWare (GSNW) to browse a NetWare Directory Services (NDS) tree, some NDS
objects may be missing from the list of available objects.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft client software does not correctly handle cases where the NDS tree
is very large. If the data requested by the client is not entirely contained by
the first reply from a NetWare server, some NDS objects may be omitted from the
list displayed by the Windows NT-based client. This may prevent users from
seeing servers or printers that ought to show up in browse lists.

This problem does not prevent users from connecting to NDS resources that exist;
it only prevents some of the resources from being displayed when browsing for
network resources.

WORKAROUND
==========

If possible, keep the size of the NDS tree to a minimum. Alternatively obtain
the hotfix mentioned below or update to the service pack containing this fix
when it is available.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
