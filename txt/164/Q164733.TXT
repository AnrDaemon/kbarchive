TITLE   :PPT7: Embedded Word Tables Show Unequal Borders
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbole kbformat

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you insert a Word table into a PowerPoint slide, and you apply borders to
some or all of the table cells, the borders appear the same width while you are
editing the table, but they change to unequal widths when you click outside of
the table. This symptom is a display effect. When you print the slide, all of
the borders print with the same thickness.

CAUSE
=====

When you insert a Word table into a PowerPoint slide, Word provides a picture of
the table that has an action associated with it. (For example, when you
double-click it, PowerPoint starts Word, and tells Word to create a table that
is a certain size and that contains certain information.) When you perform that
action, Word takes over and replaces the picture of the table with the actual
table. When you are finished editing the table, Word closes the table and
PowerPoint displays the picture of the table.

While the table is displayed in Word, the borders are described as lines.
However, once Word closes the table and PowerPoint displays the picture of the
table, the borders are described as very thin rectangles instead of lines.

Thin rectangles use different display code than lines do. If several lines have
the same thickness, PowerPoint always displays them in the same thickness.
However, if several rectangles have the same width, they are displayed with
slightly different widths depending on where they appear on screen.

NOTE: This is not a problem with Microsoft PowerPoint. The same symptoms appear
if you insert a Word table into an Excel worksheet, a Publisher publication, or
another Word document.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, enlarge or reduce the table slightly. You may need
to experiment to find the best scale percentage so that the Word table looks
best during a slide show. NOTE: If you hold the SHIFT key while you resize the
table, you will avoid stretching the table disproportionately.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
