The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Expansion Pack for Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you install the Expansion Pack for Flight Simulator for Windows 95, it will
disable the ground scenery for the default USA-Los Angeles area. The Expansion
Pack scenery will override the Los Angeles area airports.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design. The Southern California scenery area included in the
Expansion Pack disables the local scenery for Los Angeles supplied in Flight
Simulator for Windows 95. To select a Los Angeles area airport, you must use the
Southern California scenery option instead of the USA-Los Angeles option.

Do the following to select the Southern California scenery:

1. From the World Menu click Go To Airport...

2. From the Scenery Area drop-down list box, select Southern California.

3. Select the desired airport from the Airport drop-down list box.

4. Click OK.

This information is detailed in the README.TXT file located on the Expansion Pack
compact disc.
