SYMPTOMS
========

When using File Services for the Macintosh, Macintosh users may report that
files that should be available are missing or have disappeared. When viewed by
the server or PC clients, these files may found to reside on the server.

recover and resolve this issue once it has occurred, affected Macintosh volumes
should be rebuilt after the hotfix is applied. For additional information
