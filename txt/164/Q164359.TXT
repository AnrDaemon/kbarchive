TITLE   :BUG: Incorrect Evaluation of Equation with Variables
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500bug kbvfp600bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 5.0 and higher, an equation that contains variables may not be
evaluated correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

In the Command window, issue the following commands:

      SET DECIMALS TO 5
      mVar = 1
      ? mVar + (1048575+(mVar/1000)) = 1048576.001

The value .T. (True) should be echoed to the screen but .F. is returned instead.

The following recommendations may be used as alternative solutions to this
problem:

 - Replacing mVar (inside the parentheses) with 1 exhibits the correct behavior,
   as does removing the outside parentheses.

 - Using the ROUND() function may also solve this problem:

         ? ROUND(mVar+(1048575+(mVar/1000)), 5) = 1048576.001

This behavior does not occur in Visual FoxPro 3.0.
