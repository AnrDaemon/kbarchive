-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to compile a Word 97 Rich Text Format (RTF) file in the Help
Compiler that ships with Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 or the Microsoft Visual C++
4.2 Help Workshop, you may receive the following error messages:

   HC4002: Warning:

   The RTF file .\<filename> is corrupted at offset <###>

   HC4005: Warning: The .\<filename> help file has not been created.

CAUSE
=====

Word 97 writes a few new RTF flags. The older Help Compilers do not correctly
discard the new RTF flags and instead attempt to process them. Since the flags
are new, the Help Compiler fails during the compilation process.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is corrected in Help Workshop version 4.03.
The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

   Hcwsetup.exe
   (http://download.microsoft.com/download/word97win/Utility/4.03/WIN98/EN-US/Hcwsetup.exe)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Help Workshop is a program that you use to create Help (.hlp) files, edit
project and contents files, and test and report on help files. Help Workshop
takes the information in the project (.hpj) file to combine the topic (.rtf)
files, bitmaps, and other sources into one Help file that can be viewed using
the Microsoft Windows Help program.

Help WorkShop 4.02 compiles help files from RTF written both by the 16-bit
versions of Word, such as Word 6.0, and also the 32-bit versions such as Word
7.0 and Word 97.

Help Workshop 4.02 does not compile projects created in the MS-DOS version of the
Help Compiler.

A help file created in Help Workshop 4.02 does not run under Windows 3.x because
the Help Workshop 4.02 creates 32-bit help files and Windows 3.x is a 16-bit
operating environment.
