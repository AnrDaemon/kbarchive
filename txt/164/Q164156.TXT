SUMMARY
=======

When spell checking a message within a Microsoft Exchange Windows client, the
following error may be displayed

   The spelling operation could not be completed. The spelling
   checker could not be started. Some components are either missing
   or incorrectly configured in your Win.ini file. See your
   administrator.

This error is usually due to the Microsoft Exchange Client looking for spelling
files in either an invalid directory or a location that you don't have
permission to access. Confirm the following registry entries and Win.ini entries
point to valid files stored in accessible locations.

For Windows NT and Windows 95 clients:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Proofing Tools
   \Spelling\1033\Normal

   Engine=C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\PROOF\MSSP232.DLL

   Dictionary=C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\PROOF\mssp2_en.lex

For Windows 3.x clients:
