TITLE   :XFOR: Macintosh Attachments Over IMC Are Named Message.txt
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Sending multiple attachments across the Internet Mail Connector (IMC) between
two computers running Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 may result in a message from
the System Administrator saying "inbound mail failure - The message conversion
failed." You may receive another message containing a Message.txt attachment.

CAUSE
=====

The IMC does not validate line counts for binhex bodyparts in inbound non-MIME
messages, due to a fix of an issue on decoding binhex data. For more
information, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q164860 XFOR: Garbled Attachments Between Exchange 4.0 and 5.0 IMCs

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, configure the IMCs to transfer messages in binhex,
with TNEF disabled.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
