======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) documentation for CDaoRecordset::AddNew()
and the DAO SDK documentation for the AddNew method state:

   "The position of the record depends on the type of Recordset:
    - In a dynaset-type Recordset object, records are inserted at the end
   of the recordset, regardless of any sorting or ordering rules that may
   have been in effect when the recordset was opened."

The documentation is incorrect. Beginning with Jet 3.0, this behavior is not
guaranteed. The behavior was changed to improve performance as well as
concurrency issues.

To demonstrate the change in behavior, delete a record in a recordset of 300+
records and then call AddNew(). Then, traverse the recordset until you see where
the record has been added. Typically, this record will be inserted in the 253rd
record rather than at the end of the recordset.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in the documentation for Visual C++, version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the goal is to make the newly added record the current record, you should get
the bookmark of the last modified record and move to that bookmark. You can do
this with MFC DAO by doing the following:

      rs.SetBookmark(rs.GetLastModifiedBookmark());


Additional query words: AddNew MoveLast
