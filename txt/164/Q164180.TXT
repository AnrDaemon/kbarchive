TITLE   :Full App Event Log Prevents Virtual Root Enumeration & Indexing
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Application Event Log is full when the W3SVC service is started, Index
Server may not enumerate and index virtual roots.

CAUSE
=====

Index Server adds an event to the Application Event Log when it adds a virtual
root to the list to be indexed. If the Event Log is full, Index Server will not
add the root to the list to be indexed. Therefore, the catalog will not get
updated, and the queries will return incorrect results.


WORKAROUND
==========

To fix this issue, clear out the Application Event Log in Event Viewer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Index Server version
1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
