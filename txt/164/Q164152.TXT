The dialog box can't be dismissed and no other controls work inside of Developer
Studio. To exit Developer Studio, You have to use the Task Manager to End Task
on Developer Studio. This is the only way you can exit.

The problem is related to the file comctl32.dll (at least version 4.00.950). This
DLL is used to display the advanced dialog box. Comctl32.dll resides in the
Windows\System folder for Windows 95 and Winnt\System32 folder for Windows NT.
The problem does not appear when you use Version 4.70 of Comctl32.dll.
