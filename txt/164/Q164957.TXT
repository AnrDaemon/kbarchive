TITLE   :FIX: Failure to Load Odbccr32.dll on Alpha Machine
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, version 2.5, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: DEC Alpha 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open and close a database connection many times, the following error
message may appear:

   Initialization of the dynamic link library
   d:\winnt32\system32\odbccr32.dll failed. The process is terminating normally

In one case, the error occurred on the 54th time the connection was opened. This
happens when you use the version 2.50.3321 ODBC components that came with the
Visual C++ 4.x Alpha products.

You can duplicate the behavior by calling CDatabase::Open() followed by a
corresponding CDatabase::Close() in a loop.

CAUSE
=====

The problem appears to be with the ODBC components.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, use the ODBC 3.0 components for Alpha which are
available on the Internet at the following Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/odbc/

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, version 3.0.
