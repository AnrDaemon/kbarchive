SUMMARY
=======

Problems may arise when you attempt to change the password to the SQL Server
account accessing the Systems Management Server database within Systems
Management Server Setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Assuming that you are using a specific account within SQL Server, it is
necessary to do the following:

1. Create a new account in SQL Server and be sure to give it database owner
   (DBO) privilege over the database.

2. Change the account within Systems Management Server Setup to the new account.

3. Change the password on the original account in SQL Server Enterprise Manager.

4. Change Systems Management Server back to the original account with the new
   password.

Changing the account password in this manner will correct problems with Systems
Management Server accessing its SQL Server database due to account and/or
password mismatches.
