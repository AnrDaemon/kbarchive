TITLE   :SMS: Choosing "Entire Network" Causes an Exception 0E Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95; winnt:1.2 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPGC smspgckbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a client computer running Windows 95, an Exception 0E error occurs when you
open the Network Neighborhood and then click Entire Network.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by a problem with the Smsroutr.vxd file that was updated in
Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 1 (size = 25,293 bytes; date =
8/19/96).

WORKAROUND
==========

Replace the Smsroutr.vxd file with the original version of the file. The
Smsroutr.vx_ file is located in the Smssetup\X86\Intnl directory on the Systems
Management Server 1.2 compact disc. This file is not compressed, and only needs
to be renamed to Smsroutr.vxd.

Copy the file to the Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin directory on the
Systems Management Server site server.

To simplify the process of updating your existing clients, create a workstation
package that copies the updated file to the %Windir%\System directory of each
client computer running Windows 95.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2 Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Systems Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
