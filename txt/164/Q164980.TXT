-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Internet Information Server (IIS) to connect to a Microsoft Access
database, a slow memory leak may occur over a long period of time. This memory
leak depends on how heavily the server is used and how often the database is
queried. It is confirmed that this memory leak happens regardless of the query
used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. This problem has been fixed in Internet
Information Server versions 4.0

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, stop the WWW service periodically. You can do this
manually or by using a batch file to run the following commands:

   net stop w3svc
   net start w3svc

Additional query words: execute
