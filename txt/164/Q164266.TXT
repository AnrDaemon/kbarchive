TITLE   :PUB: Rulers Disappear When Inserting, Editing Object
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,97; :
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbole kbusage kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Publisher 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Publisher for Windows 95, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a PowerPoint 97 Slide or Presentation object into a Publisher
file, the rulers in Publisher disappear. The Publisher rulers remain hidden
until you close and restart Publisher.

The same symptom occurs if you double-click a PowerPoint 97 object which has
already been embedded into a publication.

This symptom does not occur if you insert an Excel 97, Word 97, or PowerPoint 7.0
object into your publication.

CAUSE
=====

When you insert a PowerPoint 97 object into a publication, the Publisher
toolbars and menus temporarily change to the PowerPoint 97 toolbars and menus.
During the change, the Publisher rulers disappear. Once you finish editing your
PowerPoint object and click outside of it, the Publisher toolbars and menus
return. However, the rulers do not reappear.

WORKAROUND
==========

After you insert a PowerPoint 97 object into your publication, save your work,
and then restart Publisher. The rulers will now be visible.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
