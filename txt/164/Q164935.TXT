TITLE   :Shared Folders Drive Subdirectories Are Shared Improperly
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server 3.0 shared folders gateway (SFGW) service allows users to share
the root directory of the drive from SNA Server Manager. You can also share
subdirectories on that drive, but these shares are not persistent. If the SFGW
service is stopped, all share information is lost. When you restart SFGW, it
shares only the root directory.

CAUSE
=====

When SFGW created the drive, the drive was considered a non-permanent drive,
similar to a floppy disk. Shares created on this type of drive disappear when
the drive does; that is, when a disk is removed or the SFGW service is stopped.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix is available to correct this problem.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
