PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProgkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On some computers running Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 1 under
Windows NT Server, you may receive an intermittent Blue Screen error when you
attempt to use Systems Management Server remote control. The Blue Screen is a
STOP 1E error in Kbstuff.sys.

CAUSE
=====

This problem seems to be very hardware-dependent, and no single factor has been
identified as causing this problem. Keyboard switches, loose keyboard
connectors, and non-standard hardware architectures have been identified, but
have not been conclusively proven to cause this problem. This Blue Screen error
occurs when the Kbstuff.sys driver is passed NULL values when it is sent a
keyboard connect message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
