TITLE   :LUA Pools Cannot Be Assigned to SNA 3.0 TN3270 Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft SNA Server version 3.0 does not allow an LUA Pool to be assigned to
the TN3270 service with SNA Server Manager.

LUA Pools could be used with the TN3270 service that is included with SNA Server
version 2.11.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server 3.0 Manager is not designed to allow the use of LUA Pools with the
TN3270 service because any LUA LUs that are assigned to the TN3270 service
operate as a virtual pool.
After the release of SNA Server 3.0, Microsoft received several requests for the
addition of support for LUA Pools to help simplify TN3270 configuration.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 3.0 Manager has been modified to allow the use of LUA Pools with the
TN3270 service. Several SNA Server files were updated to provide this support.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
