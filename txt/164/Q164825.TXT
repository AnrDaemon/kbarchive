KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProgkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On client computers using the 16-bit remote control agent (under Windows for
Workgroups or Windows 95) with the "Permission Required" option enabled, the
user at the target desktop has the option to grant or deny the remote control
session. However, the user does not have this option on the second attempt to
remote control the computer. After the session ends, the Administrator can
re-initiate the same Help Desk function (Remote Control, Remote Chat, and so on)
while still in the Help Desk window, and there is no prompt at the client. The
user at the target desktop does not have the opportunity to deny the session.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
