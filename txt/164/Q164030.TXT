TITLE   :WD97: Define and Lookup Reference Unavailable in Word
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbsetup word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Define and Lookup Reference menu commands are not available in Word 97 after you
run Setup to add Microsoft Bookshelf Basics.

NOTE: Define should be located on the shortcut menu when you right-click a word,
while "Look Up Reference" should be located on the Tools menu.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Word 97 for Windows may not detect the Bsh32.wll when Microsoft
Bookshelf Basics is installed during maintenance mode Setup.

WORKAROUND
==========

Rename the Office 97 Setup Table File (.stf) (Off97pro.stf) and then reinstall
Microsoft Office 97. The .stf file should be located in the following folder:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Setup

NOTE: When you run the Office 97 Setup, be sure to click the Custom button when
prompted for the type of Setup you want to perform. Then, ensure that Microsoft
Bookshelf Basics is selected.

WARNING: This modification may not be supported by Microsoft. Microsoft support
professionals will support some modifications to a BACKUP copy of the .stf file.
Note also that while support professionals may help customers modify specific
lines of an .stf, we will not rewrite the entire file in order to achieve a
desired configuration. As a general rule, support is limited to options that can
normally be changed by a user during a standard installation of the
application.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Bsh32.wll is the file that gives Word the ability to function seamlessly with
Microsoft Bookshelf Basics by adding the Define and Lookup Reference menu
commands. It is and is located in the "\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office"
folder.
