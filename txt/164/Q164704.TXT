TITLE   :Password Change DLL Fails if First Host Account Cache Offline
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The password change DLL, a component installed on Windows NT primary domain
controllers (PDCs) as part of the Windows NT account synchronization option of
SNA Server host security setup, may fail to initialize when the PDC is rebooted.
When the initialization failure occurs, it will log an error indicating that it
cannot locate the password management service (SnaPMP, the SNA Windows NT
account synchronization service). This will happen if the SNA host account cache
running in only one of the resource domains is offline or unreachable even
though host account cache services in other domains are reachable at the time.

CAUSE
=====

Although host security setup for Windows NT account synchronization prompts the
user for multiple domains that contain a host account cache, the password change
DLL tries to initialize with only the first of the configured domain names. The
password change DLL needs to find the host account cache to locate the primary
Windows NT account synchronization service (SnaPMP), which may be running in
another Windows NT Server domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

The password change DLL has been enhanced to search all specified domains. The
list of domains is specified in the following registry key where the Windows NT
account synchronization option of host security is installed:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNAPmp\Parameters
   MdbDomains: REG_MULTI_SZ: <domain1> <domain2> ...

The following file has been changed:

   \<snaroot>\Snapwchg.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
