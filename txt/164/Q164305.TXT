SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a USB camera with certain PCI video cards in Windows 95 OEM Service
Release version 2.1 (OSR2.1), performance may be reduced or your computer may

operation.

1. In Control Panel, double-click Display.

2. On the Settings tab, click Advanced Properties.

3. On the Performance tab, move the Hardware Acceleration slider to None.
