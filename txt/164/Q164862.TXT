TITLE   :XCON: MTA Raises Exception Error on X.25 Connections
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server MTA may raise an exception error on X.25
connections. Specifically, a RaiseException() may occur in the X.25 DMOD in the
MTA.

CAUSE
=====

RaiseException()is called from the MTA code when it receives an X.25 result for
an X.25 control block (CB) that no longer exists. This condition should be
handled by the MTA rather than causing the MTA to stop. The error handling was
changed to remove the RaiseException() and add in a DebugBreak() for the debug
build (in Ntil\Cc\Sbpdeccb.c).

The change allows the MTA to obtain more information the next time it happens
with the debug build, and still does not stop normal running of retail builds.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
