TITLE   :Backup Host Account Cache Service Hangs on Startup on WinNT BDC
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the SNA Server Host Account Cache service is installed as a backup on a
Windows NT Backup Domain Controller server (with a primary host account cache
installed on a Windows NT Primary Domain Controller server), the Host Account
Cache service will hang. This may cause the following behavior:

 - The SnaBase service will appear as started.

 - The SnaRpcService will not start.

 - SNA Manager will hang when started.

Forcibly ending the Host Account Cache service will cause the SnaRpcService to
start correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The backup Host Account Cache service was attempting to synchronize with the
primary Host Account Cache service, before notifying service control manager
that it has started. However, the synchronization between backup and primary was
failing to complete.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem. The updated
modules are:

   <Snaroot>\Hssystem\Snaudb.exe
   <Snaroot>\Hssystem\Snahsmsg.dll


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
