STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem typically occurs with Novell clients that log on to their Novell
servers before running Windows. When you change the swap file, Windows gives you
the option to restart or continue. If you choose to continue and then close
Windows and run INVDOS or log off and log on (and Smsls.scr runs), it may report
PC memory incorrectly.
