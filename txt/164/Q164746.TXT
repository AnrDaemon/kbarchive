TITLE   :SMC 9332 EtherPower 10/100 Driver Does Not Load
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbnetwork kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SMC 9332 EtherPower 10/100 PCI Fast Ethernet network adapter driver may not
load if it is manually selected in the Select Network Adapter list.

This problem also occurs with the driver in the Drvlib\Netcard\Smcpci folder on
the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM.

CAUSE
=====

The SMC 9332 EtherPower 10/100 PCI Fast Ethernet adapter has a Digital Equipment
Corporation 21140 chip on it. Windows NT detects this adapter as a DEC PCI
FastEthernet DECchip 21140 adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

If it is the only network adapter in the computer, remove the driver for the SMC
9332 adapter and let Windows NT detect it as a DEC PCI FastEthernet DECchip
21140 adapter. Or, install the driver from the disk included with the adapter.

If there is more than one network adapter in the computer, remove the SMC 9332
driver and manually select the DEC PCI FastEthernet DECchip 21140 driver in the
Select Network Adapter list. Or, install the driver from the disk included with
the adapter.
