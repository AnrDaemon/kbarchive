TITLE   :SMS: Invwin32.exe Does Not Respond to Resync Requests
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinvkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an inventory resynchronization (resync) is requested by the Systems
Management Server site server to a computer running Windows NT Server that only
runs the SMS_INVENTORY_AGENT_NT service (Invwin32.exe), the resync never
occurs.


Systems with this problem are typically missing some inventory groups that are
normally displayed in the client's Personal Computer Properties window. A common
scenario is to see only the Identification and Network Monitor groups, and no
others.

WORKAROUND
----------

To work around this problem, delete the history file that corresponds to the
computer's Systems Management Server Unique ID. This file is located in the
following directory on the Systems Management Server site server:

   SMS\Site.srv\Inventry.box\History

STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server version
1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
