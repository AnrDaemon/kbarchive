TITLE   :Err Msg: Event ID: 4320 Duplicate Name on Network
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your Windows NT-based computer, you may receive the following
error message:

   At least one service or driver failed during system startup.

The event viewer contains the following event log:

   Event ID: 4320
   Source:   NetBT
   Description: Another machine has sent a name release message to this
                machine probably because a duplicate name has been
                detected on the TCP network. The IP address of the node
                that sent the message is in the data. Use nbtstat -n in a
                command window to see which name is in the Conflict state.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may be caused by a static mapping in the Windows Internet Name
Service (WINS) server, which may conflict with the multihomed registration of
your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, delete the static mapping in the WINS server. To do so,
use the following steps:

1. On the WINS server computer, start the WINS Manager.

2. Click Mappings, click Static Mappings, and then click the entry that
   corresponds to your computer.

3. Click Delete Mapping, and then click close.

4. Restart your Windows NT-based computer (not the WINS server).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recommends static mappings only for non-WINS aware computers which are
unable to register with a WINS server automatically.

A multihomed name registration allows a machine with more than one IP address to
register on a NetBIOS network without a name conflict.
