TITLE   :PRB: Programmatically Adding Stored Procedure May Cause Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error may appear when you programmatically add a stored procedure
to a database container with the APPEND PROCEDURES FROM command and set SAFETY
to ON:

   Warning: The procedures contain compile errors. Would you like to add them
   anyway?

The dialog box has a choice to Add or Cancel.

RESOLUTION
==========

You should add either a blank line to the beginning of the file being appended
or a carriage-return line-feed to the end of the database stored procedure.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Execute the following code, which creates a database container and a procedure
file:

      SET SAFETY ON
      CREATE DATABASE proctest
      SET DATABASE to proctest
      mhandle = FCREATE("proctest.txt")
      =FWRITE(mhandle, "PROCEDURE proctest"+chr(10)+ ;
                       "   WAIT WINDOW 'proctest'"+ chr(10)+ ;
                       "ENDPROC")
      =FCLOSE(mhandle)
      MODIFY PROCEDURE

After closing the Stored Procedures window, issue the following from the Command
window:

      APPEND PROCEDURES from proctest.txt

Issue the APPEND PROCEDURES again and the error should occur.

If the text file is edited to add a blank line to the beginning of the file, the
error does not occur.

If FPUTS is used instead of FWRITE during the creation of the procedure file, the
error does not occur because FPUTS appends a carriage-return, line-feed to end
of the file, which allows the newly appended procedure to start after, rather
than on, the last line of the stored procedures.

Setting SAFETY OFF, does not show the error dialog box and the procedure is
appended to the stored procedures but not necessarily in the correct location.
