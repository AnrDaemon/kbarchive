SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to delete a CPI-C Symbolic Destination Name from within SNA
Server Manager, an application exception occurs. This causes a Dr. Watson log
error to be generated. The Drwtsn32.log file that is generated will contain
information similar to the following:

   

   Application exception occurred:
      App: exe\snaexp.DBG (pid=<process id number>)
      When: <date> @ <time>
      Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)
