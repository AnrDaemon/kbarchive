======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

This issue applies to a Windows 95 user connecting to a Windows NT sharepoint
containing compressed directories and files. The problem is observed from the
Windows 95 client when using a drag-and-drop operation to move a compressed
Windows NT directory into Windows 95 Briefcase. The resulting problem is that
the directory is copied but files under the directory are not copied.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Windows NT sends to Windows 95 a file attribute of
0x820 in reply to a findfirst request. Windows 95 was not handling the 8xx
portion of this reply and was failing to copy files containing the attribute.
All Windows NT compressed files contain the 8xx attribute designation.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95, and later
versions of this file:

SYNCENG.DLL  version 4.00.951  dated 7/16/96  55,296 bytes



To work around this problem, do not store user profiles in compressed folders on
Windows NT-based computers. If necessary, uncompress the folder used to store
user profiles and re-create the user profiles.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. An update
to address this problem is now available, but is not fully regression tested and
should be applied only to computers experiencing this specific problem. Unless
you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this update at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for
additional information about the availability of this update.

This issue is resolved in Microsoft Windows 98.
