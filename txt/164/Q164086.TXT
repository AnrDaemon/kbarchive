TITLE   :Err Msg: http/1.0 500 server error (-2146893048) with Proxy
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT: 1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to view a secure web site from your Microsoft Internet Explorer
version 3.01 and earlier, you may get the following error message:

   http/1.0 500 server error (-2146893048)

CAUSE
=====

A problem exists with Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication of the Web
Proxy clients.


WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following methods:

Methods One
-----------

1. Make sure all clients are using Internet Explorer version 3.01 or later.

2. Install Service Pack 2 for Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 on the proxy
   server.

3. Install the Winsock Proxy client program on the client computers.

4. In the Internet Explorer Proxy settings, type the name of the proxy server
   for all protocols EXCEPT Secure. This will force the browser to use the
   Winsock Proxy service instead of the Web Proxy service when you try to
   connect to a SSL (secure) page.

   All other browser requests will use the Web Proxy service and still take
   advantage of caching. This method will allow the use of Windows NT Challenge
   for all protocols because the Winsock Proxy has its own Windows NT Challenge
   authentication built-in.

Method Two
----------

Disable Windows NT Challenge/Response and enable Basic Authentication.

Method Three
------------

Install the Winsock Proxy Client and disable the Proxy connection settings on the
Internet Explorer clients. All clients will use the Winsock Proxy service only.
