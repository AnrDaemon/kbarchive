The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server 2.11 and 3.0 fail to dynamically activate an LU (through the host
dynamic definition of dependent LUs) after the connection has been active for
five minutes. After five minutes, the SNA Server stops sending NMVTs to request
activation, and rejects client 3270 session activation requests (that is,
Open(SSCP) requests) with the following error:

   No free LU in LU Pool.

CAUSE
=====

After five minutes, SNA Server no longer attempts to activate dynamically
defined 3270 LUs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

The updated modules are:

   <Snaroot>\System\Snaservr.exe
   <Snaroot>\System\Trcservr.exe (used for debugging purposes only)

STATUS
