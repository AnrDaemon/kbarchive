The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a PERL 5 script, you may get the following Dr. Watson error
message:

   Exception Access Violation (0x00000005), address 0x77e77dc9.

CAUSE
=====

You have three or more "%s" entries after the value .pl in the following key:

   Hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\W3Svc\ 
   parameters\Script Map

WORKAROUND
==========

You may use up to two "%s" entries after Perl.exe, as in .pl: REG_SZ:
C:\perl\bin\perl.exe %s %s.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

After you install PERL for WIN32, you will have to edit the registry to add the
script map entries under the following key:

   Hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\W3Svc\ 
   parameters\Script Map

The value is .pl: REG_SZ: C:\perl\bin\perl.exe %s.
