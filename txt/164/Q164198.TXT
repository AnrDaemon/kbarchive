======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you rename a file that is currently open in Sound Recorder and then save
the file, the file is saved with the previous name.

CAUSE
=====

Sound Recorder does not look for the specified file in its original location.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MFC programs (such as WordPad) open a Save As dialog box when a file is not
found in its original location. Sound Recorder does not do this; it simply saves
the file with the original name instead.

Additional query words: 95
