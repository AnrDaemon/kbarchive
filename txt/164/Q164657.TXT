TITLE   :SMS: Pcmwin32.exe Prevents PCM Service from Running Package
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcmkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Package Command Manager (PCM) service (Pcmsvc32.exe) fails to run a
mandatory or background package if the PCM Client (Pcmwin32.exe) is also
running.

CAUSE
=====

When you first run Pcmwin32.exe, it loads itself into memory. Closing the PCM
Client does not stop it running or unload it from memory. Removing Pcmwin32.exe
from memory requires a modification to the Smsrun32.ini and a subsequent log off
and log on.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do either of the following:

 - Configure the site properties so that the PCM Client does not automatically
   run when a user logs in. Doing this ensures that the PCM service runs the
   package when the job's mandatory time has been reached.

   -or-

 - On the individual client, remark out the load line for Pcmwin32.exe in the
   Smsrun32.ini file, to ensure that this application does not run when a user
   logs in. This file is located in the Ms\Sms\Data directory. Make the
   following change:

         [startup]
         ;load=C:\MS\SMS\BIN\pcmwin32.exe

   Note that this manual modification of the Smsrun32.ini file will be
   overwritten if the Systems Management Server client is upgraded (for example,
   by applying a Systems Management Server service pack).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the original released versions of Pcmsvc32.exe and Pcmwin32.exe, this
functionality was by product design. However, the updated PCM service (dated
12/20/96) and PCM Client (dated 11/15/96) that are available on the Internet (at
http://www.microsoft.com/) are not supposed to exhibit this behavior. When this
problem is resolved, the new versions of these files will be posted to the
Internet web site.
