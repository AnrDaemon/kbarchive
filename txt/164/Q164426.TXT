The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are configuring the CompuServe Mail service for Microsoft Exchange
using the Profile Wizard, you may receive the following warning after you
complete the CompuServe Account Information page and click Next, even if all the
fields are filled in:

   Please fill in all of the information requested.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Your Name field contains only extended
characters. The Profile Wizard requires at least one standard ASCII character in
the Your Name box.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, add one character to the end of the Your Name
field and finish configuring the profile. Start Microsoft Exchange and then
click Services on the Tools menu. Click the CompuServe Mail service, click
Properties, and then delete the extra character from your name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
