TITLE   :XCON: MTA: Remote X.400 MTA Fails to Decode NDR from Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When sending a message from a remote X.400 MTA through Microsoft Exchange Server
to the Internet, the remote X.400 MTA may fail to decode a Non Delivery Report
(NDR). The Non Delivery Report is created by the Microsoft Exchange Server.

CAUSE
=====

In the Non Delivery Report the "ReportTransferEnvelopeExtension" is empty. This
field is in the "ReportTransferEnvelopeExtensionsFields," which is in the
"ReportTransferEnvelope." This is a violation of the P1 encoding as described in
the X.411 Blue Book specification.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

A message sent using the following route may cause a Non Delivery Report:

    X.400 MTA -> 1988 X.400 Connector -> Microsoft Exchange Server -> Internet
    Mail Connector -> Internet

The user on the X.400 MTA sends to an Internet recipient. The address of the
Internet recipient is included in the DDA Type and DDA value fields.

For Example:

c=US;a=ADMD;p=PRMD;o=ORG;dda.type=SMTP;dda.value=USER(A)DOMAIN

If the user sends to an incorrect address, for example:

c=US;a=ADMD;p=PRMD;o=ORG;s=TEST;dda.type=SMTP;dda.value=USER(A)DOMAIN

Microsoft Exchange Server creates a Non Delivery Report for this message, which
is correct behavior. The remote X.400 MTA may not be able to decode this Non
Delivery Report.
