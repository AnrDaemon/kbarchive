SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to bypass the network logon during the first reboot
after running Setup by using the Msbatch.inf file for batch installations of
Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this article.
Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you proceed.

You can use the Autologon registry entry to prevent the display of a network
logon dialog box. This key is added as part of the installation. However, simply
adding the key is insufficient. Unless the key is removed, the user is not
prompted to log on to the network, and does not have more than basic
connectivity. To bypass the network logon dialog box, remove theAutologon key
from the registry after the first reboot.

There are two parts to accomplishing this. The first part is to modify the
existing script to add the appropriate key, copy a file, and add another key to
the registry that causes Windows 95 to implement a second file. The existing
script should be modified to include the following lines:

   [Install]
   CopyFiles=@auto.inf
   Addreg=Add.Autologon

   [DestinationDirs]
   DefaultDestDir=10

   [SourceDisksFiles]
   auto.inf=22,,1234

   [SourceDisksNames]
   22="Source",,0

   [Add.Autologon]
   HKLM,"Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Network\Real Mode

      Net",Autologon,1,0

   HKLM,"Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce",Autooff,,

      "rundll setupx.dll,InstallHInfSection DefaultInstall 132 auto.inf"

The second part is to create a file named Auto.inf in the root folder of the
distribution point. The file should contain the following lines:

   [version]
   signature="$CHICAGO$"

   [DefaultInstall]
   delreg=auto.on.reg

   [auto.on.reg]
   HKLM,"Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Network\Real Mode

      Net",Autologon
