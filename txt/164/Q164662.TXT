OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When users from Quikcomm send a message with one or more attachments to
Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 users by way of the Microsoft Exchange Internet
Mail Service, the message comes through as an attachment.

When the message enters the Microsoft Exchange environment, the following error
message appears:

   The Microsoft Exchange Server received an Internet message that could
   not be processed.
   To view the original message content, open the attached message.
   <Message.txt>

Message.txt contains the actual message and the attachment as uuencoded.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 MIME uudecoder is not working to the
specifications. Specifically, it is not skipping unrecognizable characters after
the uuencode end line is found.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
