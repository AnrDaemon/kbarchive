SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply changes for a user ID using the Host Account Manager (UDCONFIG),
choosing the Select option to change to a new user account causes the following
message to appear:

   

   You have not applied your changes, do you really wish to exit?
   Yes / No

Because the changes were already applied, this message should not appear.

security domains were configured for the user.
