The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

After sending a print job to a Windows NT 4.0 printer, Event Viewer may report
multiple instances of the same job printing successfully every two to five
seconds, even though the print job is not printed until later. In these events,
the byte count on the job is 0. When the job prints, the event reports the
actual byte size.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
