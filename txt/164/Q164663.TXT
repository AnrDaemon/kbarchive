TITLE   :Windows NT Client Config Tool Sets Incorrect Registry Entry
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Client Configuration Tool (Ntconfig.exe) for the Windows NT SNA Server 3.0
client incorrectly specifies REG_SZ as the data type for the following registry
entry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
      \SYSTEM
         \CurrentControlSet
            \Services
               \SnaBase
                  \Parameters
                     \Transports


CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT SNA Client Configuration Tool incorrectly set the data type for
the Transports registry value to REG_SZ instead of REG_MULTI_SZ.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Windows NT SNA 3.0 Client Configuration Tool has been updated so that it
creates the correct data type for this registry value.

The updated file is:

   <Snaroot>\System\Ntconfig.exe

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
