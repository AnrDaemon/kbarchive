TITLE   :AFD Executive Worker Thread Causes Excessive Nonpaged Pool Use
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A computer running Windows NT Server may stop responding or report virtual
memory errors under high stress situations. Excessive nonpaged usage can be
viewed in Performance Monitor.

If pool tagging is enabled, the TCPt and Afde pooltags allocated bytes will rise,
exhausting non paged usage.


CAUSE
=====

In cases like these, processes fail to free memory pages once they are done with
them. Over time, this leads to a highly stressful situation for a system.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for Windows NT
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
