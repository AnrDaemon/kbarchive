OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Microsoft Exchange or Windows Messaging in Windows 95, if you
attempt to insert a file into a new mail message with the Link Attachment As
Original File option, you may receive the following error message:

   You must enter the \\computername\sharename followed by the path and filename
   of the file that you wish to insert as a linked attachment

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you select a local file that is not on a shared network
resource without using the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) format
(\\<computername>\<sharename>\<path>\<filename>).

RESOLUTION
==========

To insert a file using the Link Attachment To Original File option, use one of
the following methods:

 - In the File Name box, specify the file using the UNC format.

 - To access the file by browsing Network Neighborhood, follow these steps:

   1. In the Look In box, click Network Neighborhood.

   2. Double-click the computer you want to access, and then double-click the
      shared folder you want.

   3. Click the file you want to link, and then click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you insert a file into a new message, you can use the Link Attachment As
Original File option to insert a shortcut link to a file that will be accessed
using the network. For other network users to access this file, the file must be
located on a shared network resource either on the local computer or on a remote
server that can be accessed using the UNC format.
