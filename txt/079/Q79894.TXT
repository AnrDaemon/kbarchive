-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Microsoft Windows is running in 386 enhanced mode on a machine using QEMM
version 6.0 as the memory manager, Windows may display the logo screen and then
abort with an error message stating:

   To run Windows enhanced mode, run QWINFIX before running Windows again.

WORKAROUND
==========

To eliminate this error message and allow Windows to function properly in
enhanced mode, use the current version of HIMEM.SYS as the memory manager
(instead of QEMM386.SYS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

QWINFIX is a utility provided by Quarterdeck Office Systems in conjunction with
the Quarterdeck Expanded Memory Manager (QEMM) version 6.0. QWINFIX modifies the
Windows SYSTEM.INI file by adding the line

      SystemROMBreakPoint=false

to the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI. This is required because QEMM386.SYS, when
invoked with the RAM parameter, remaps system ROM into RAM.

For further information on the use of SystemROMBreakPoint, see the Windows readme
file SYSINI3.TXT, or query on the words

   QEMM and SystemROMBreakPoint

QWINFIX is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
