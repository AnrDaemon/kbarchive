SUMMARY
=======

If you are unable to run Microsoft Windows in standard mode on a Unisys (Sperry)
Micro IT personal computer, a few hardware components should be checked.

According to Unisys technical support, a ROM BIOS version 1.58 and a 101-key
keyboard must be used to run Windows in standard mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Unisys (Sperry) Micro IT, Model #T3137, is an 80286 personal computer
packaged with ROM BIOS version 1.52z and a Sperry Professional 88-key keyboard.
Windows 3.0 real mode works properly on this system; however, standard mode
causes the system to stop responding (hang) or return to an MS-DOS command line
after the initial Microsoft Windows 3.0 logo screen appears.

There appears to be a conflict between the internal functionality of the 88-key
keyboard and any version of HIMEM.SYS. This can be resolved by obtaining a
101-key keyboard from Unisys. The "feature number" for this product is:
F5177-00.


ROM BIOS version 1.58 can be obtained from Unisys. The "feature number" for this
part is F496402.

The Unisys products included here are manufactured by Unisys, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
