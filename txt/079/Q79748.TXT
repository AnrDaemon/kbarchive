======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a file in a Microsoft Windows 3.0 accessory program,
the program looks for a file with the accessory's default extension. If the file
cannot be found, the accessory asks you to insert a disk in drive A. If you
choose the Cancel button, Windows asks if you want to create the file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.0. This
problem does not occur in later versions of Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you attempt to open a file in a Microsoft Windows 3.1 accessory program,
the program first looks for a file with the accessory's default extension. Then
it looks for the file with no extension. If none is found, it returns an error
similar to the following:

   

   <filename.ext> Cannot find this file. Please verify that correct
   filename and path are given.

       OK

If you choose OK, Windows returns to the File Open dialog box, thus allowing you
to correct the filename.
