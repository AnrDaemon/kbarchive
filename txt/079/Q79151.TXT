TITLE   :FIX: MASM 6.0 May Incorrectly Insert Prologue with USES
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0, if a procedure header that
contains the "USES" keyword is directly followed by a data segment definition,
MASM may insert the prologue code inside the new data segment.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, merely place a code label directly after the
procedure header as demonstrated in the sample code below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: /c /Fl /Sg

   .MODEL small, c
   .DATE
           db "1234567890"

   .CODE
   alpha PROC uses ax bx   ; Problem with these parameters.
   ;dummy:                 ; Uncomment this line for workaround.

   .DATE
   table   dw 1234h
           dw 5678h
   LEN EQU ($ - table)/2

   .CODE
       mov ax, LEN
       ret
   alpha ENDP
   END
