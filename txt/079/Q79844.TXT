======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0, predefined symbols for the
date and time of assembly were introduced. They are:

   @Date
   @Time

These symbols can be used to construct strings that contain the date and time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code demonstrates two methods of embedding the information
in a string in the object. Date1 and Time1 are constructed using one method,
Date2 and Time2 using the other. Assemble with /Fl to get a listing that shows
the expansion.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Assemble options needed: none
   */ 

   .MODEL small
   .STACK
   .DATA

   tmp         equ <>
   tmp         CatStr <">, @Date, <">
   Date1       byte tmp

   tmp         equ <>
   tmp         CatStr <">, @Time, <">
   Time1       byte tmp

   %Date2      byte "&@Date"

   %Time2      byte "&@Time"

   .CODE

   start:
       mov ax, @data
       mov ds, ax

       mov ah, 4ch
       int 21h

   END start
