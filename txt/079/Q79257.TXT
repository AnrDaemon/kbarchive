SUMMARY
=======

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Ahead Systems user manuals refer you to the DRIVER.DOC file included on the
utility disk for installing the appropriate driver. The procedure involves
expanding your driver from your "zipped" (compressed) format on the utility disk
to a blank formatted disk that will be a working install disk. It is important
to also copy the OEMSETUP.INF file to the working install disk.

Once the working install disk has been created, it will contain the following
video drivers for appropriate resolutions:

   Drivers      Resolution  Colors
   -------      ----------  ------

   WIN480.DRV   640 x 480   16 colors
   WIN600.DRV   800 x 600   16 colors
   WIN768.DRV   1024 x 768  16 colors
   W480.DRV     640 x 480   16 colors
   W600.DRV     800 x 600   256 colors
   W768.DRV     1024 x 768  256 colors

   Drivers        Description
   -------        -----------

   OEMSETUP.INF   Setup information file to ensure all files are
                    installed properly
   VDDVGA.386     Virtual device driver to load for enhanced mode

To use a specific driver, use the Windows Setup program to install the driver to
the hard drive from the working install disk.

If during the installation procedure of the video driver you receive a request
for a .GRB file, then the OEMSETUP.INF was probably not copied to the working
installation disk.

For additional information, please contact Ahead Systems.
