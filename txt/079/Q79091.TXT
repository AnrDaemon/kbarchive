The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows version 3.0 may not run on an AEG Olympia LT 386sx Laptop
computer if the screen saver and low-battery alert options are enabled in the
CMOS setup of the system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

AEG Olympia has confirmed that Windows may not run in any mode on the Olympia LT
386sx laptop computer when the Power Saving Time-Out options are not set to
Default.

The Power Saving Time-Out option consists of a low-battery alert and a built-in
screen saver feature. When this option is set to Default, both of these features
are disabled and Windows should load successfully. Information on how to set
these options can be found on page 6-5 of "The Laptop User's Guide" for the AEG
Olympia LT 386sx.

Attempting to run Windows with either of these option enabled causes the system
to display a blank screen and stop responding (hang). The only solution to this
problem is to disable both of these options in the system CMOS setup.
