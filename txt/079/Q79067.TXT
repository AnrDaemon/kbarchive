TITLE   :FIX: A2029 Incorrectly Generated If Operand = [ebx][ebx]
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) 6.0, the following error is generated
incorrectly for instructions using the operand [ebx][ebx]:

   error A2029 : multiple base registers not allowed

For example:

   lea esi, [ebx][ebx]
   mov esi, [ebx][ebx]

RESOLUTION
==========

A workaround for this problem is to embed the opcode for the instruction
directly in the code. The sample code below demonstrates this method.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
has been corrected in MASM version 6.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Error A2029 will be incorrectly generated for the following program. The code
that should be generated for lea esi [ebx][ebx] is 8D 34 1B. Note that the
operand [ebx][ebx] is available only when using the .386 or .486 directives.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assembler options needed none

   .386
   .MODEL flat
   .STACK 4096

   CODE32 SEGMENT PUBLIC USE32
    main PROC near
       lea esi, [ebx][ebx]      ; Replace this by BYTE 8Dh, 34h, 1Bh
       ret
   main ENDP
   CODE32 ENDS

   END
