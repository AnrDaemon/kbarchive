SUMMARY
=======

STAC Electronics has provided a self-extracting file (SD0S5.EXE) on their
bulletin board that can be used to automatically upgrade MS-DOS 5.0 for use with
Stacker.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Stacker version 2.0 includes a .BAT (batch) that automatically upgrades MS-DOS
5.0. If you have an earlier version of Stacker, you can use the SDOS5.EXE file
to achieve the same results.

To upgrade MS-DOS 5.0 with SD0S5.EXE, do the following:

1. Download the SDOS5.EXE file from STAC Electronics bulletin board service
   (BBS).

2. Execute the SDOS5.EXE file. It creates three files:

      STACDOS5.DOC
      STACDOS5.BAT
      VIDTYPE.EXE

3. Copy the three files created with the SDOS5.EXE file to the STACK directory
   on the compressed (STACKER) volume.

4. Execute the STACDOS5.BAT file. Follow the instructions on the screen to
   upgrade to MS-DOS 5.0.

The STAC products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
