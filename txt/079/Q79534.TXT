SUMMARY
=======

The NEC P9 XL printer driver that ships with Microsoft Windows 3.0 does not
support color, even though the driver includes a color option and the
Windows/286 driver for this printer supports color. An update of the driver with
color support is available directly from NEC.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under Windows/286, this printer driver supports color printing. However when
Windows 3.0 was released, the driver was changed and does not support color
printing. Unfortunately, the printer setup box was not changed to the indicate
the difference.

NEC has since updated the driver and it now supports color printing, even in
Paintbrush. To obtain this driver, call NEC.
