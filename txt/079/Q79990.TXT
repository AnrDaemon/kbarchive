KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The Idlewild program included with the Windows Entertainment Pack volumes 1, 2,
and 3 will not work correctly if you have the automatic checking feature of
FAXit for Windows running on the machine. FAXit's automatic checking program
will check the hard disk for an incoming fax once every minute. Because of
FAXit's manipulation of system timers, Idlewild will never time out and blank
the screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To blank the screen in Idlewild, follow either step 1 or 2 below:

1. Blank the screen manually, as follows:
   a. From the Options menu, choose Blank Now.

      -or-

   b. Move your mouse to the "sleep now" corner in the upper-right- hand corner
      of the screen.

      -or-

2. Remove FAXit's fax-checking program (FAXITSCH.EXE) from the WIN.INI load=
   line and restart Windows.

   Note: If you remove FAXITSCH.EXE, FAXit will not notify you of incoming faxes.
