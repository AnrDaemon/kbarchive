The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a

SUMMARY
=======

The NETWORKS.TXT document file included with Windows 3.0 refers to the
NetAsyncSwitching statement. This statement is supposed to go under the
[Standard] section in the SYSTEM.INI file; however, there is no explanation for
this command in the SYSINI.TXT file.

This information applies to Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a. This does
not apply to later versions of Windows.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following explains NetAsyncSwitching.

NetAsynchSwitching=<0 or 1>
Default: 0
Purpose: Indicates whether Windows will allow you to switch away from an
         application (running in standard mode) after it has made an
         asynchronous network BIOS call. The default value of 0
         specifies that task switching is not allowed. Switching away
         from some applications that make these calls might cause
         your system to fail. Once Windows detects an asynchronous
         NetBIOS call, it will not allow switching from the application
         even if no more of these calls are made. Set this value to 1 if
         you are sure the applications you use will not receive network
         messages while they are not active.

To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
