PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

To run Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows volumes 2 and 3, make sure
Windows is installed in standard or enhanced mode. When setup for either volume
is run on a machine running in real-mode Windows, the floppy drive will be
accessed momentarily, the computer will hang, and the drive light will remain
on.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before running, the Windows Entertainment Pack volume 1 and 2 Setup programs do
not check to see what mode Windows is running. In addition, the Setup programs
do not issue an error message when they determine that Windows is running in
real mode.

To run Setup successfully, Windows must be run in standard or enhanced mode.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows Entertainment Pack
version 1.0 volumes 2 and 3. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.
