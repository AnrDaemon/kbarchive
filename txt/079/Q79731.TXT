The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the SET TEMP statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file is invalid or set to a drive
that has insufficient disk space, Microsoft Windows may not function properly in
standard mode. If this is the case, when you press ALT+ESC to return to Windows
from an MS-DOS-based application, the following error message may be displayed:

   Your program cannot be swapped out to disk. There is not enough space on your
   disk. The suspended program will be restarted. You must free disk space to
   switch out from this application, or else you must end the program before
   trying to go back to Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For Windows 3.0 and 3.1 in standard mode to switch back from an MS-DOS-based
application, Windows must swap that application to the hard drive. The area
where Windows places this application on the hard drive is determined by the SET
TEMP statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. This problem may also arise if the SET
TEMP statement is set to a drive that is low on disk space or if the SET TEMP is
set to a RAM drive that is not large enough.
