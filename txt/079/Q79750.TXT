SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Word for Windows, you can use a bookmark as the text argument in a
table of contents entry (TC) field; this causes the bookmark to become part of
the table of contents.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: You cannot insert the bookmark field by pressing CTRL+F9 in the Field Code
box of the Insert Field command; therefore, the following procedure is more
efficient than using the Insert Field command for entering a table of contents
entry that references a bookmark.

To display a bookmark in a table of contents, follow these steps:

1. Press CTRL+F9 to insert field braces at the location in the document where
   you want the table of contents entry to appear.

   NOTE: If the bookmark is in the header or footer of the document, the TC field
   must be entered in the main body of the document.

2. Type "TC " (without the quotation marks). Be sure to press the SPACEBAR to
   create a space after TC.

3. Press CTRL+F9 to insert a second set of field braces, and then type the
   bookmark name. The resulting TC field should appear as follows:

   {TC {bookmark_name}}

4. Add any additional TC field switches or instructions after the bookmark
   field.
