-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Microsoft Windows in enhanced mode and you attempt to scan
a document with the Complete Scanner, you can't see the image on the screen.

CAUSE
=====

According to Complete technical support, the Complete Scanner does not work
properly with Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode when the scanner is connected through
a scanner port on the Complete Fax Card.

NOTE: This applies only when the scanner is connected through a scanner port on
the Complete Fax Card.

WORKAROUND
==========

According to Complete technical support, you can work around this problem by
adding the following line to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

      COMXIRQ=false

where X equals the COM port to which the card is assigned)

This disables the modem when Windows runs in enhanced mode and allows the scanner
to work correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Complete Scanner is an MS-DOS application and should work correctly in real
and standard modes, or outside of Windows.
