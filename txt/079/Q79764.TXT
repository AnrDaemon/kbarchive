SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows programs normally may not have more than 15
files open at once. Visual Basic for Windows displays the error message "Too
many files" (error code 67) when you attempt to open more than the maximum
number of files at once. You can increase the maximum number of open files by
calling the Windows API function SetHandleCount.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows API function SetHandleCount requests Windows to change the maximum
number of files a program can open. SetHandleCount returns the actual number of
handles that the program can use, which may be less than the number requested.

The FILES= statement in the CONFIG.SYS file does not limit the number of files
available to a Microsoft Windows program.

Do not attempt to increase the number of files with MS-DOS interrupt 21 hex with
function 67 hex. This interrupt does not record information needed by Windows.

Example
-------

The following code example demonstrates how to use SetHandleCount:

'*** In the global module: ***

   Declare Function SetHandleCount% Lib "kernel" (ByVal n%)

'*** In the form: ***

   Sub Form_Load ()
      n% = SetHandleCount(60)  ' Request 60 file handles.
      MsgBox "Maximum number of open files: " + Format$(n%)
   End Sub
