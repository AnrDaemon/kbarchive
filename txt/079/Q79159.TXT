TITLE   :FIX: Incorrect Code Generated If Operand Is [esp][esp]
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0, incorrect code is generated
for instructions using operand [esp][esp], such as the following instructions:

   lea esi, [esp][esp]
   mov esi, [esp][esp]

CAUSE
=====

The operand [esp][esp] is not supported in the Intel instruction set. An error
such as:

   error A2029 : multiple base registers not allowed

should have been generated by the assembler.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A listing file from the following program will show that the instruction lea
esi, [esp][esp] is encoded as 8D 34 24. This is incorrect.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assembler options needed: none

   .386
   .MODEL flat
   .STACK 4096

   CODE32 SEGMENT PUBLIC USE32
   main PROC near
       lea esi, [esp][esp]      ; An error A2029 should be generated.
       ret
   main ENDP
   CODE32 ENDS

   END
