======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0, the online help
contains a documentation error when describing how to detect an extended
keyboard. The entry reads:

   0000:0496 1 word If bit 5 set, indicates extended keyboard installed.

In general, the "Microsoft Macro Assembler Programmer's Guide" for version 6.0
refers to the low order bit as bit 0. Therefore, the user is led to believe that
if the bit corresponding to decimal value 32 is set (bit 5), then there is an
extended keyboard installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

The bit that should be checked is the one corresponding to decimal 16, or bit 4.
