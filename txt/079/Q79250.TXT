The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

IBM has confirmed that the PCJr will not operate properly with Microsoft MS- DOS
5.0 or later.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A symptom of above incompatibility is the following error message that may be
displayed during the MS-DOS 5.00 setup routine:

   Runtime Error R6003 - Integer Divide By Zero

Due to the architecture of the IBM PCjr, only MS-DOS versions 2.1 through MS-DOS
3.3 are considered compatible with the IBM PCjr series of computers.

Note: The IBM PCjr can only access a maximum of 640K. To use as much of the 640K
as possible, IBM suggests you not use any version of MS-DOS later than 3.3.

The product included here, the IBM PCjr, is manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
