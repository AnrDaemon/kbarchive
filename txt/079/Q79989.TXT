SUMMARY
=======

DPMI0301.exe is a sample that demonstrates how an application developed for the
Microsoft Windows operating system can use MS- DOS Protected Mode Interface
(DPMI) functions 0300h (Simulate Real Mode Interrupt) and 0301h (Call Real Mode
Procedure with Far Return Frame). DPMI0301.exe contains source code for a TSR
and an application for the Microsoft Windows graphical environment that
demonstrate simulating real mode interrupts using DPMI.

The DPMI0301 example has two parts. One part is an MS-DOS terminate-and-
stay-resident (TSR) program that must be run before Windows is started. The TSR
hooks Interrupt 72h.

The second part of the example is an application that runs under Windows and
communicates with the TSR program. When the application starts, it issues a
software Interrupt 72h by calling DPMI Function 0300h (Simulate Real Mode
Interrupt).

When the TSR program receives this interrupt, it returns the address of an
internal routine in the DX:BX register pair. The application takes the address
and saves it in the CS and IP structure variables.

Then, when the user selects the menu item in the application, the application
calls DPMI function 0301h (Call Real Mode Procedure with Far Return Frame). At
various points, the application and the TSR program send messages to the serial
port to indicate the progress of the application-TSR program communication.
