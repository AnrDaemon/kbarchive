TITLE   :PRB: Pen-Based Computer Unavailable While Running AfterDark
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing environment, when the AfterDark
screen saver application runs a password-protected screen saver on a pen-based
computer that has no keyboard attached, it is not possible to regain control of
the machine.

NOTE: The AfterDark screen saver application is manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this products' performance or reliability.

CAUSE
=====

Apparently, AfterDark installs a hook function and eliminates all mouse activity
when it installs a password-protected screen saver; this disables pen input as
well.
