-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows, or when you execute an application from inside Windows
without specifying a path, you may receive the following error message

   System Error
   Cannot read from drive <x>:

where <x>: is a floppy disk drive or a removable media drive letter.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused when you specify a removable media's drive letter in the
MS-DOS PATH statement of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Windows reads all path
specifications in the PATH command before it runs an application. It does not
stop the search after finding the specified file in the search path.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that the drive letter for a removable drive does not appear on the
search path in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Example

1. Quit Windows.

2. Type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:

   path = c:\;c:\dos;c:\windows;a:\

3. Run Windows.

4. In Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

5. Type the following and press ENTER:

   chkdsk

Windows then tries to read drive A before running the MS-DOS CHKDSK command. If
no disk is in drive A, then it generates a "Cannot read from drive A:" error
message.
