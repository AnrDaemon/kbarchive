SUMMARY
=======

The error message "general failure error" may occur when trying to access a
floppy drive on a system infected by the Michaelangelo virus. If the virus is
present, the error message can occur regardless of which MS-DOS version is
running at the time. If the machine is booted from a floppy disk, the virus is
inactive and the error message will not be displayed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Michaelangelo virus is present on a hard drive, it will disable (make
unreadable) the boot record of any floppy disk (that is not write-protected)
when the disk drive is accessed. The virus resides in the partition table and
cannot be destroyed by repartitioning.

NOTE: McAfee's ScanV82 can detect this virus. The code name for the Michaelangelo
virus is "MICH." For more information about this virus detection software,
