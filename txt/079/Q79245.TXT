SUMMARY
=======

It is not possible for a program or batch file to execute a DOSKEY macro. All
DOSKEY macros must be executed from the command prompt.

One workaround is to incorporate the DOSKEY commands into a batch file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS-DOS DOSKEY.COM program is a utility included with the MS-DOS 5 or later
Upgrade. The DOSKEY utility allows MS-DOS 5.0 or later commands to be recalled
and edited. DOSKEY may also be used to develop command line macros (DOSKEY
macros).

DOSKEY macros are used to store a series of commands that may be recalled by
entering the name of the macro.

The DOSKEY utility uses software interrupt number 16 (INT 16) to poll keyboard
ready and to fetch characters. Because batch files and programs do not send
their commands through this interrupt, DOSKEY has no way to "see" or intercept a
request to execute a macro.

As a possible solution for batch file programming, replace the desired DOSKEY
macros with corresponding batch file commands.

For more information about DOSKEY and DOSKEY macros, see pages 448-454 of the
version 5.0 "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."

For more information on batch file programming, see Chapter 10 of the version 5.0
"Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."
