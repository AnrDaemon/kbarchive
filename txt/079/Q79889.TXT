-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you are using the Stacker XT/8 Coprocessor with Microsoft Windows running in
386 enhanced mode, you need to add an EMMExclude statement to the [386Enh]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

NOTE: This does not apply to the Stacker AT/16 Coprocessor because it does not
use a RAM address.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The range of memory addresses depends on the base address of the Stacker XT/8
card. The base address is found on the Stacker DEVICE statement in the
CONFIG.SYS file and is identified by the /B parameter.

The following table lists the seven possible memory ranges, based on the base
address of the XT/8 Coprocessor card:

   Base Address     <range> to Exclude
   ------------     ------------------

   c400             c400-c7ff
   c800             c800-cbff
   cc00             cc00-cfff
   d000             d000-d3ff
   d400             d400-d7ff
   d800             d800-dbff
   dc00             dc00-dfff

For example, if the Stacker XT/8 Coprocessor base address is d000, using Notepad,
add the parameter listed below to the SYSTEM.INI file under the heading
[386Enh]:

      EMMEXCLUDE=d000-d3ff
