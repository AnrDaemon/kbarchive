SUMMARY
=======

Earlier models of the Magnavox 286 personal computer may have trouble running
Windows with a serial mouse. One problem may be hanging at the logo screen when
trying to run Windows 3.0 in standard mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem stems from the fact that several models of the Magnavox 286 have a
built-in bus port for the mouse. Windows expects to find the mouse on the bus
port and it will hang during its boot if the mouse is connected elsewhere, such
as on a serial port.

The Magnavox machines for which this information applies include:

   Headstart 300
   Headstart 300 CD
   Maxstation 286
   Magnum GL

All of these machines are Magnavox-Philips 286-based machines.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
