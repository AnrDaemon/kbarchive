SUMMARY
=======

When copying and pasting records from one data file into another, or pasting
records at the end of the current data file, the Paste command will be gray if
the "new" record is not selected.

The new record is always the last record in the data file window. It is selected
by clicking the word "New" to the left of the empty record. Paste will become
available once New is selected.

Additional query words: grey datafile
