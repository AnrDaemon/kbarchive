SUMMARY
=======

When running a program created by the Microsoft Macro Assembler, an "integer
divide by 0" may be generated. In MASM version 6.0 and later, the error number
generated will be R6003. The documentation for MASM version 6.0 gives the
following explanation:

   Run-time error R6003

   integer divide by 0

   An attempt was made to divide an integer by 0, giving an
   undefined result.

Another possible cause, documented in the Microsoft Macro Assembler version 5.0
Programmer's Guide under DIV/IDIV, is the quotient overflowing its target
register.
