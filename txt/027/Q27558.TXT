TITLE   :FIX: Protection Violation, Application Error, From COMMON Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.1,5.0,5.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN compiler for OS/2, versions 4.1, 5.0, 5.1 
 - Microsoft FORTRAN Compiler for MS-DOS, version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to run an application fails and the corresponding message below
appears on the screen. In FORTRAN for OS/2, the following message appears:

   A program caused a Protection Violation.

If the application compiled as a QuickWin application, the following message
appears:

   Unexpected Application Error

CAUSE
=====

The name of a COMMON block in the application ends with the letters "code." The
compiler confuses the code and data segments that have similar names. When the
application writes to the COMMON block, the generated code writes into a code
segment.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, modify the source code to rename the COMMON block.
The last four letters of the name cannot be "code."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN versions 4.1, 5.0, and
5.1. This problem was corrected in FORTRAN PowerStation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code example demonstrates this problem.

Sample Code
-----------

         COMMON /PCODE/ I
         I = 7
         END

Additional query words: nofps 4.10 5.00 5.10
