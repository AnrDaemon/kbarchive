KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install or upgrade to Windows NT 3.5 on an AST Ascentia 900N 486 DX/50
computer, the Drive A icon is not available in File Manager when the computer is
running on AC power.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the BIOS revision of the computer is lower than version
2.5.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, obtain 05528317.EXE and SET4NT.EXE from the AST
Bulletin Board Service (BBS) at (714) 727-4132 (14.4K-baud modem) or (714)
727-4723 (2400-baud modem), or contact AST Technical Support at (800) 727-1278.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply the fixes, the Drive A icon appears in File Manager if the
computer uses AC power only. This is because Windows NT 3.5 does not support
power management on the AST Ascentia 900N computer.
