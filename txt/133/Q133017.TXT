SYMPTOMS
========

Destroying projects and/or files from SourceSafe does not free disk space in
SS\DATA subdirectories.

CAUSE
=====

Once a file is branched in SourceSafe, there are four associated files that are
not deleted from the disk at this point. The reason this occurs is so the
reference between the branch and original file is maintained. There is no way to
undo this behavior after the branching has occurred.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the branching sparingly.

One common practice is to use share and branch to perform a file copy. A better
alternative is to share the file or project and destroy the old copy. This
preserves the history and allow disk space to be recovered at a later time.

When the history is not needed, get the desired version to a disk location and
add the files to the desired project. This gets a clean copy and preserves the
ability to recover the disk space at a later time.
