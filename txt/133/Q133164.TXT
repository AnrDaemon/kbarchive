The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, the header object in a Grid does not support multiple-line captions.
It is possible, however, to simulate multiple-line header captions by placing a
label on top of the header. This article provides an example that shows you how.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro does not natively support multiple-line headers. However, by
modifying the height of the header and placing labels with a transparent
backcolor on top of the header, you can achieve the visual representation of a
multiple-line header.

The following example illustrates this process using the Form Designer.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a form.

2. From the Form Controls toolbar, select the Grid object, and place a grid on
   the form.

3. In the Property sheet, modify the Columncount property of the grid to 2.

4. In the Property sheet, change the HeaderHeight to 45, and set the column's
   header to a blank space, as follows:

         Grid1.HeaderHeight = 45
         Grid1.Column1.Header1.Caption = " "

5. Change the Caption property of Header1, contained in Column1:

         Caption= " "  &&Press the Spacebar and Click the check mark

6. Select the Label control from the Form Controls toolbar, and place a label on
   top of the header.

7. In the Property sheet, change the following properties for the label
   control:

         BackStyle:  0-Transparent

8. On the Caption property, click the Fx button. After deleting the current
   text, type the following line in the expression builder:

         "First Line" + CHR(13) + "Second Line"

9. Save and run the form.

The header in the first column of the grid displays a two-line caption.
