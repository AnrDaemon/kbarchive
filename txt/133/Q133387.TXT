TITLE   :SETLS16 Fails to Enumerate a Domain Using SMSLS.INI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SETLS16 may fail to perform the domain to domain mapping in the SMSLS.INI file.
This can happen in two cases.

 - SETLS16 is unable to find the primary domain controller for the domain the
   client is being mapped to, and the call it made to do so returns the
   following error:

   a list of servers for this workgroup is currently unavailable

 - The domain name is lowercase in the SMSLS.INI file.

   To work around this problem, make sure the domain names are in upper case
   letters in the [domain section] section of the SMSLS.INI file.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
