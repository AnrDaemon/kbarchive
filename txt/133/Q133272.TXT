TITLE   :Unattended Windows NT Setup Always Sets Up the Network
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOM
-------

The unattended installation method available with Windows NT Setup sets up
the network, even if the !SetupNetwork value in the answer file,
UNATTEND.TXT, is changed from YES to NO.

NOTE: The answer file, UNATTEND.TXT, is shipped with the Windows NT 3.5
Resource Kit.

CAUSE
=====

The following two errors in the INITIAL.INF file cause this problem:

 - Setup compares the value of the variable $(!STF_NTUPGRADE) in INITIAL.INF to
   the incorrect value YES, without quotes. The comparison value should be
   "YES", with quotes, instead.

   Here is the code fragment showing the problem in the fourth line:

      ifstr(i) $(!STF_GUI_UNATTENDED) == "YES"
              shell "subroutn.inf" GetDefaultAnswer "GuiUnattended"
      ;;;;;;;;Incorrect String Compare Below;;;;;;;;;;;;;
              ifstr(i) $(!STF_NTUPGRADE) != YES
                  ifstr(i) $(!SetupNetWork) == "NO"
                      set !DoNetwork = $(NotChosen)
                  endif
                  ifstr(i) $(!SetupApplications) == "NO"
                      set !DoAppSetup = $(NotChosen)
                  endif
                  set !DoPartial = $(NotChosen)
                  set !DoPrinter = $(NotChosen)
              else
                  set !STF_GUI_UNATTENDED = "NO"
              endif
          endif

 - Setup compares the value of the variable $(DoNetwork) in INITIAL.INF to the
   incorrect variable of $(!Chosen). The comparison variable should be
   $(!NotChosen), instead.

         Incorrect code in INITIAL.INF:
            ntlanman = +
            ifstr(i) $(DoNetwork) == $(!Chosen)

         Corrected code:
            ntlanman = +
            ifstr(i) $(DoNetwork) == $(!NotChosen)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51.
