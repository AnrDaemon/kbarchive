TITLE   :Cannot Install Windows 95 Drivers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install an OEM driver (such as a printer or display driver), you
cannot later update the OEM driver with the Windows 95 version of the same
driver if you reinstall Windows 95. You cannot therefore revert back to the
original Windows 95 driver.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 cannot load a Windows 95 driver over an OEM driver of the same name.

RESOLUTION
==========

Manually extract the Windows 95 version of the driver from the Windows 95 disks
or CD-ROM and copy it over the OEM driver of the same name. For information
about extracting files, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q129605 How to Extract Original Compressed Windows Files

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur if the OEM driver does not have exactly the same
name as the Windows 95 driver it replaces.
