SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to find addresses in Automap Streets.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The address databases and address finding routines used in Microsoft Automap
Streets work best if use the following guidelines:

1. Use numeric house numbers. For example, use "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue"
   (without the quotation marks) instead of "Sixteen Hundred Pennsylvania
   Avenue".

2. Road names that are the same as a suffix, such as "Circle Drive" or "Court
   Avenue" may not be correctly interpreted by the program.

3. If Automap Streets does not find an address, shorten the address by entering
   the street name only. For example, if no match is found for "2345 Someplace
   Avenue Southwest" try "Someplace Avenue" or "Someplace".

4. If a map has more than one road with the same name and one of the roads does
   not have house number data, Automap may not find either street. Shorten the
   address by removing the house number and try again.

5. When you find the street you want, if you click in different points along the
   street, the status bar at the bottom of the screen will show the closest
   house numbers.
