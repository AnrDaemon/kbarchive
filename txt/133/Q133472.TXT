TITLE   :Screen Saver Locks Out Account After You Enter Invalid Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT locks your user account before you reach the highest number of
allowable logon attempts with an invalid password.

This problem occurs if you turn on the account lockout option and configure the
screen saver to use password protection.

CAUSE
=====

The counter for the number of logon attempts with invalid passwords does not get
reset after you log on successfully.

For example, you configure Windows NT to lock a test account after two logon
attempts with invalid passwords, and configure the desktop to use a screen saver
with password protection. If you enter an invalid password during the first
logon attempt after the screen saver locks the desktop, but you enter the
correct password during the second attempt, Windows NT logs you on. If you enter
an invalid password the next time you need to clear the screen saver, Windows NT
does not accept your valid password.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51.
