TITLE   :FIX: Spinner Doesn't Inherit Color Props from .vcx Definition
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A spinner definition created in a visual class library will not display the
inherit color definitions (Forecolor, Backcolor, DisabledForecolor, and so on)
when instances are created on a form. This occurs whether the Form Designer or
the AddObject method is used to create the instances even though the color
definitions are in the Properties Sheet. When the form is run, the spinner
reverts to a display of the standard color property definitions for a spinner.

WORKAROUND
==========

Add the following code to the Init method of the spinner definition in the
visual class library (VCX):

       WITH This
           .ForeColor = .ForeColor
           .BackColor = .BackColor
           .DisabledForeColor = .DisabledForeColor
           .DisabledBackColor = .DisabledBackColor
           .SelectedForeColor = .SelectedForeColor
           .SelectedBackColor = .SelectedBackColor
       ENDWITH

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro 3.0b
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open a new project, and add a new visual class library definition for a
   spinner.

2. Change the Forecolor and Backcolor properties from the default to any colors
   desired. Save the definition as Myspinner.

3. Open a new form, and place the Myspinner object from the visual class library
   onto the form. The spinner object appears with the default colors for a
   spinner, not those of the class definition, though the correct colors display
   in the properties list.

You can edit the colors and reset them to the defaults by clicking the right
mouse button while editing the form, but when the form is run, the colors revert
to the default colors for a spinner.
