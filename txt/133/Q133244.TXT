TITLE   :PRB: CD Command Results in "Unrecognized command verb" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing the CD.. command in the Visual FoxPro Command window to change to the
parent directory, generates this error message:

   Unrecognized command verb.

CAUSE
=====

The Visual FoxPro parsing algorithm looks at CD.. as one token, so it generates
the error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following correct syntax when using the CD command to change to the
parent directory:

   CD ..

NOTE: There must be a space between CD and the two periods. This information is
documented in the "CD|CHDIR Command" topic of the Help menu.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
