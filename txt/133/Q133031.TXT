TITLE   :Event ID 4280 Appears for WINS Bound to One NIC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) on a computer
that has one network interface card (NIC), the following event appears in the
Event Viewer system log:

   Event ID: 4280
   Source: WINS
   Type: Error
   Description: The machine you are running the WINS server on does
   not have a valid address. When WINS requested the system for the
   address, it got 0.0.0.0 as the address.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the WINS client binds last, and TCP/IP is below Remote
Access Service (RAS). WINS binds to the first NIC on a computer that has
multiple NICs bound to TCP/IP.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, install the fix mentioned below.

To work around this problem:

1. Run Control Panel and choose Network.

2. Choose Bindings.

3. In the Show Bindings For list box, choose WINS Client(TCP/IP).

4. Ensure TCP/IP binds before RAS (Remote Access WAN Wrapper).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
Workstation or Server version 3.51. For information on obtaining this update,
