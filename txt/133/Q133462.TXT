SUMMARY
=======

The way an item is added to a shopping list or organized on that list is
determined by the type of list you are creating.

For example, if you are adding an item to your shopping list under the recipe
name, the item is inserted under the ingredient that is currently highlighted.
If you are adding an item under miscellaneous, the item automatically goes to
the end of the list.
