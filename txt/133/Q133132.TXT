======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a Zenith ZNote-Flex Notebook computer to copy files across a
network, the files may be lost or damaged if the computer switches into Suspend
mode while the files are being copied.

CAUSE
=====

The Zenith ZNote-Flex Notebook computer has a Suspend Time-out setting. When
this option is enabled, it ignores interrupts from the hard disk and PCMCIA
controllers and switches the computer into Suspend mode after the selected
interval.

If the computer switches into Suspend mode while you are copying files across a
network, the network connection is suspended, possibly resulting in lost or
damaged files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable the Suspend Time-out setting in the computer's CMOS settings. For
information about configuring the computer's CMOS settings, please refer to your
computer documentation or manufacturer.
