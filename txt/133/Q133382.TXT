SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT 3.51 on a Compaq Proliant 4500 series computer, the
following error message appears:

   Setup is unable to locate the hard drive partition prepared by the MS-DOS
   portion of Setup.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you allow Windows NT 3.51 Setup to detect the mass
storage device of the computer. Windows NT 3.51 does not include drivers for
Compaq 32-bit SCSI-2 controllers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Obtain Compaq Support Software Diskette (SSD) 1.15a (SP1209.EXE). SP1209.EXE
   is available for download on the Compaq bulletin board system (BBS) at (713)
   378-1418 or the CPQFORUM on CompuServe.

2. Run Windows NT 3.51 Setup and choose Customer Setup.

3. Skip the detection of mass storage devices and specify additional devices.

4. Select "Other (Requires disk provided by hardware manufacturer)" and specify
   the location of the Compaq SSD 1.15a disk.

5. Select "Compaq 32-Bit SCSI-2 Controllers" for the onboard SCSI controller.

6. Continue with Setup.
