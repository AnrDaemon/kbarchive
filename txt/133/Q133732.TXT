Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

You may notice one or more of the following symptoms:

 - TrueType fonts may not be present in the Fonts folder.

 - You may receive the following error message if you try to add a TrueType
   font:

   The <fontname> TrueType font is already installed. To install a new
   version, first remove the old version.

 - TrueType fonts are not listed in any program.

 - Previously created documents are printed differently or the formatting is
   changed when you view the document.

 - When you print a document, the text may appear smaller than expected.

 - Custom desktop settings have changed fonts.

CAUSE
=====

The registry key that lists TrueType fonts may be damaged or missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method:

Use the Fontreg Tool
--------------------

Running Fontreg.exe adds a registry key that allows the installation of TrueType
fonts. To run Fontreg.exe and install the fonts, follow these steps:

NOTE: The Fontreg tool (Fontreg.exe) is not included with Windows NT 4.0. To use
this tool in Windows NT 4.0, copy the Fontreg.exe file from a Windows
95/98-based computer.

1. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

2. Type "fontreg" (without the quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click
   OK.

3. In Control Panel, double-click Fonts.

4. On the File menu, click Install New Font.

5. In the Folders box, select the folder that contains the TrueType fonts
   (usually Windows\Fonts).

6. Click Select All, and then click OK.

7. If your documents are not printed as you expect, remove and reinstall the
   appropriate printer driver.

Edit the Fonts Registry Key
---------------------------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95/98 or Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee
that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

To replace a missing or damaged Fonts key in the registry, follow these steps:

1. Move the contents of the Fonts folder to an empty folder.

2. If the Fonts key exists in the following registry setting, delete the Fonts
   key and then add it again:

   Windows 95/98:
   --------------

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion

   Windows NT:
   -----------

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion

   If the Fonts key does not exist in the registry setting listed above, add the
   following key:

   Fonts

3. In Control Panel, double-click Fonts.

4. On the Fonts menu, click Install New Font.

5. In the Folders box, select the folder you moved the fonts to in step 1.

6. Click Select All, and then click OK.

7. If your documents are not printing as expected, remove and reinstall the
   appropriate printer driver.
