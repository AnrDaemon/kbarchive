SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running ChessMaster 4000 Turbo, the screen may become distorted if
you move or resize the taskbar.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you move or resize the taskbar and you are using the
Always On Top option for the taskbar. The problem occurs because ChessMaster
4000 Turbo does not adjust itself when the desktop area becomes smaller than the
current window.

RESOLUTION
==========

ChessMaster 4000 Turbo works correctly if you leave the taskbar in its default
location or if you disable the Always On Top option for the taskbar. To disable
the Always On Top option, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click an empty space on the taskbar, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

2. On the Taskbar Options tab, click the Always On Top check box to clear it.

3. Click OK.
