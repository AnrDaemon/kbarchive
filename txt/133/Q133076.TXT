TITLE   :Duplicate Entries in Fax Cover Page List
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A single cover page may have multiple entries in the Fax Cover Sheets list. When
this occurs, you can select only one of the duplicate entries.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you add a cover page from a network resource. Editing
and saving this cover page results in a reference to the local copy and a
shortcut to the network copy.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, rename the shortcut to the network copy of the cover
page in the Windows folder. To do so, type the following command at an MS-DOS
prompt in the Windows directory:

   " ren <shortcut name>.lnk <shortcut name>.xxx " (without the
   quotation marks)

NOTE: You should rename this file at an MS-DOS prompt to remove the .lnk
extension.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
