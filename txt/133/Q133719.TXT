SUMMARY
=======

MaxLanMailSize is an INI file option that can be used with EXTERNAL.EXE version
3.2.x. This option is used to restrict the size of messages that users can send
to an external postoffice residing on the same local area network (LAN). This
option does not affect $SYSTEM messages that are sent during the directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync) process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is possible to limit the size of the address updates that the postoffice
receives from the Dir-Sync server by selecting Config, DirSync, Requestor,
Options, Limit in the Administrator's program (ADMIN.EXE).

When a Dir-Sync requestor requests address updates from the Dir-Sync server, the
server compares this limit against the update response that it is preparing to
send. If the update response exceeds this limit, pacing is used.

Pacing is a process where the Dir-Sync server sends the global address updates
only until the limit is reached. The remaining updates are sent by the Dir-Sync
server in subsequent response messages. This is used to spread the propagation
of large numbers of address updates over several synchronization cycles.

When a Dir-Sync requestor requests a complete Import (Config, DirSync, Requestor,
Import), this limit cannot be used to pace the response. A manual Import must be
performed. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q119450 Err Msg: Fatal 118 Transaction Limit Reached

The MaxLanMailSize option for External can be found on pages 252 and 253 of the
Microsoft Mail "Administrator's Guide."
