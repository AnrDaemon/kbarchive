KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may not be able to start Windows 95 in Safe mode if your computer requires a
machine-switch parameter on the Himem.sys line in the Config.sys file in order
to boot.

CAUSE
=====

When you start Windows 95 in Safe mode, the Config.sys file is not processed.
Therefore, the Himem.sys line, and any parameter on the line, is not processed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To process the Himem.sys line when you start Windows 95 in Safe mode, follow
these steps:

1. Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
   the F8 key, and then choose Step-by-Step Confirmation from the Startup menu.

2. Press Y when you are prompted to load the DoubleSpace driver, press N when
   you are prompted to process the system registry, press Y when you are
   prompted to process the startup device drivers, and then press Y when you are
   prompted to process Himem.sys, Ifshlp.sys, and Setver.exe.

3. Press N when you are prompted to process the startup command file
   (Autoexec.bat) and when you are prompted to load the Windows graphical user
   interface.

4. At the command prompt, type "win /d:m" (without the quotation marks) to start
   Windows 95 in Safe mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following line is an example of a Himem.sys line with a machine-switch
parameter:
