======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Text may not display in Chef's Tips when you use ATI video drivers set to
display at 65,000 or 16 million colors under Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51.

CAUSE
=====

The Chef's Tips display white text on a black background. When the ATI video
driver is set to 65,000 or 16 million colors, the black background shows. This
behavior may occur in other programs when white text is displayed on a black
background.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Julia Child: Home
Cooking With Master Chefs version 1.0 for Windows. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: Close open files and programs before you attempt these steps.

To resolve this problem, change the color display to 256 colors using the
following steps:

1. Open the Control Panel, which is located in the Main program group.

2. Click Display.

3. In the Color Palette box, set colors to 256.

4. Click the Test button to test the color setting before changing the system
   settings.

5. If the test is successful, click Restart Windows Now.
