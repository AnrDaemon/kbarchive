SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Gateway Service for NetWare (GSNW) in Windows NT 3.51 and
choose Help in Control Panel GSNW, the following error message appears:

   The <drive>:\%SystemRoot%\system32\nwdoc.hlp file is not a Windows Help
   file, or the file is corrupted.

%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 directory. The NWDOC.HLP in that directory is only 111
bytes.

To work around this problem, manually expand NWDOCGW.HL_ from the Windows NT
Server compact disc (CD) to the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 directory as NWDOC.HLP.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
