KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The timer control is visible on a form at run time when it should not be.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the coordinates of the timer control to an off-screen location. For example,
add the following lines to the code in the form's Init event:

      thisform.timer1.left = -100
      thisform.timer1.top = -100

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a form named Test.

2. Add a timer control to the Test form.

3. In the form's Init event, type:

      thisform.width = 500
      thisform.height = 500
      thisform.fillstyle = 0
      thisform.fillcolor = rgb(255,0,0)
      thisform.box(0,0,thisform.width,thisform.height)

4. Save and run the form.

The form's Fillcolor property is set to a color other than the backcolor of the
form, and a box is drawn around the area that contains the timer. When you run
the form, a white rectangle appears where the timer is located.
