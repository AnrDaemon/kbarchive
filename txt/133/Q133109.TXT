The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

If you start the 32-bit versions of Microsoft Mail and Schedule Plus from the
Startup program group with Schedule Plus configured to Run Minimized, and return
to the Windows NT desktop from a screen saver, Mail intermittently stops
responding (hangs) for a short period of time.

WORKAROUND

To workaround this problem, disable the Run Minimized option for Schedule Plus
program item properties, log off, and log back on as the same user.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
