SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to disable items in a combo box or list box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Combo Box Example
-----------------

1. Create a Form with a combo box (either with a style of DropDown Combo or
   DropDown List).

2. In the DblClick method of the DropDown Combo or the RightClick method of the
   DropDown List, place this code:

      This.List(This.ListItemId)='\'

   NOTE: The DblClick method in the DropDown List does not disable the item. That
   is why a RightClick method is recommended.

3. In the RowSource for the combo box, place this code:

      SELECT DISTINCT city from customer into cursor MyCity

   NOTE: In general, it doesn't matter what the RowSource or Type are.

4. In the RowSourceType for the combo box, select 3 - SQL Statement.

5. Run the Form, and select an item on the list. When the item appears in the
   combo box, you can disable the item by double-clicking it or by clicking it
   using the right mouse button.

Possible Enhancements
---------------------

 - If you want to disable a specific item on the list, you can replace the
   ListItemId with a specified Item Number.

 - You can use the ComboBox Layout DisabledItemForeColor property to change the
   color of the disabled item text.
