KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to Windows 95, you may receive various error messages when you
start Windows 95 stating that items in the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files
could not be loaded. These error messages may indicate that specific hardware is
not accessible because a real-mode driver could not be loaded.

CAUSE
=====

Setup does not recognize multiple configurations created by a third-party tool
such as Bootcon, and may not properly modify the configuration.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you cannot start Windows 95, follow these steps:

1. Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
   the F5 key.

2. Edit the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files as necessary. You can use the
   Sysedit tool to edit these files. To do so, click the Start button, click
   Run, type "sysedit" (without the quotation marks) in the Open box, then click
   OK.

Note that Windows 95 does not require a Config.sys or Autoexec.bat file. These
files are necessary only for backward compatibility. If there is no such need in
your configuration, remove or rename the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files and
then restart your computer.

If the files are required, rename them (for example, change Config.sys to
Config.sav and Autoexec.bat to Autoexec.sav) and then install Windows 95.

After you install Windows 95, restore the files to their original names. You may
need to edit the files to make sure that Windows 95 drivers and other drivers
are loaded correctly.

You may want to use the Windows 95 multiple configuration feature instead of a
third-party tool such as Bootcon. For information about using multiple
configurations in Windows 95, search for "multiple configurations" in Windows 95
Help.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Bootcon uses REM statements to delimit multiple boot configurations. Setup may
not recognize the separate configurations and may modify the wrong
configuration.
