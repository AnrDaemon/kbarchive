TITLE   :Error Message: Volume "Sys" Does Not Exist
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you log on to a Novell NetWare server and your login script runs, you may
receive the following error message:

   Volume "SYS" does not exist

CAUSE
=====

This error message may occur because a directory, and not the volume, referenced
in the login script does not exist.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform one of the following:

 - Update your login script to reference a valid directory.

   -or-

 - Create the directory on the NetWare server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is most commonly seen when using the following command where Windows NT
incorrectly reports V5.00 for the %OS_VERSION variable and that directory does
not exist on the Novell server:

   Map root <drive>:=<server>\sys:public\msdos\%OS_VERSION

Running the same login script from Windows 95 produces the following error
message:

   Path is invalid in map command
   "Y:SYS:PUBLIC\MSDOS\V5.00".

Running the same login script from MS-DOS, using the ODI/VLM stack and NetWare's
Login.exe produces the following error message:

   LOGIN-4.084-915: The specified volume does not exist
   [ROOT S4:=SYS:PUBLIC\MSDOS\V5.00]
