SUMMARY
=======

PPP Multilink Protocol (PPP MP) is a technology that provides up to 128
kilobytes per second (kb/s) wire speeds on a single ISDN line by combining two
B-channel calls. Each B-channel provides a 64 kb/s link.

Microsoft supports Multilink Protocol starting with NT 4.0 and RAS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Channel Aggregation is a proprietary method designed by Digi International (the
makers of Digiboard) that allows speeds greater than 64 kb/s using 2 B-
channels. To attempt to use speeds greater than 64kb/s, use one of the following
methods:

Windows NT version 3.5x
-----------------------

Modify the phone book entry by editing the entry, clicking the ISDN button, and
entering 2 in the Channels to Use category.

Windows NT version 4.0
----------------------

1. In Dial-Up Networking, click More, click Edit entry and modem properties.

2. Select Multiple Lines in the Dial using drop down list.

3. Click Configure and enter a phone number for each line which you are using.
