TITLE   :Network User Profiles Not Supported on Real-Mode Networks
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Server-based user profiles do not work on a computer running only a real- mode
network client.

CAUSE
=====

You must use a 32-bit network client and a network operating system that
supports the creation of home directories to use server-based user profiles.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install a 32-bit protected-mode network client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can store user profiles (user-specific information) on a local computer or a
network server. Using user profiles allows multiple users to use a single
computer and retain their individual settings, or to log on to the network from
any computer and use the same desktop settings.

Storing user profiles on a network server requires:

 - 32-bit protected-mode client services that support automatic download and
   update of user profiles.

 - A network operating system that supports the creation of home directories.
   The protected-mode client network services included with Windows 95 download
   and update user profiles from the following directories:

    - Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks:

   \\primary domain controller\user's home directory

    - Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks:

   \\preferred server\sys\mail\user_id

The following conditions are supported when you are using user profiles on a
network:

 - Profiles stored on a Windows NT 3.x server on workstations running the
   Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks.

 - Profiles stored on a Novell NetWare server, with Windows 95-based
   workstations running the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks.

 - Profiles stored on other network operating systems that support the creation
   of home directories and supply their own 32-bit client services.
