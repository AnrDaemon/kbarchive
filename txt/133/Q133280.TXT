TITLE   :FTPSVC: Delay Receiving FTP Directory Annotation and Prompt
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you logon to a very busy Windows NT 3.51 ftp server, you experience a delay
receiving the directory annotation and ftp prompt (after you enter your
password).

Network Performance Monitor (PERFMON.EXE) shows the number of ftp server current
connections increasing, but the number of anonymous users logged on decreasing.
The system normally recovers within a few minutes.

CAUSE
=====

The FTP service was modified for Windows NT version 3.51 to provide directory
annotation of the ftp root directory at logon. The calls used to do this
annotation involved unnecessary file locking, especially when no ~ftpsvc~.ckm
(directory annotation) file existed in the ftp root directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

Microsoft corrected this problem in the modified file, FTPSVC.DLL. This fix
improves logon performance by optimizing the directory annotation code so it
does less file locking.

NOTE: This fix was tested on ftp.microsoft.com, which performs over 50,000
anonymous ftp logons per day.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
