TITLE   :NetWkstaSetUid2 API Returns Access Denied
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAPI kbSDKPlatform kbNetAPI kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run a batch file that repeatedly logs a user on and logs using the
NetWkstaSetUid2 API, you may receive "Access Denied" error messages.

NOTE: The error message that is returned depends on the application that is
calling the NetWkstaSetUid2 API.

CAUSE
=====

NetWkstaSetUID2 performs the following three distinct operations:

1. Discovery. A mailslot message is sent to all the domain controllers (DCs) in
   a domain. Each DC responds with a message indicating whether the user account
   exists on the DC, and contains the name of the DC responding. The client
   looks at the first response and ignores the others.

2. Authentication. To authenticate the password, the client calls NetUseAdd IPC$
   to contact the first DC that responded.

3. Account Information. A remote API call is used to retrieve account
   information to determine if you are an administrator, your password
   expiration date, and so on.

The problem listed above occurs when the third operation fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not already
done so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Windows NT version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
