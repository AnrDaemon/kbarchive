MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are using a SoundBlaster Pro (or compatible) sound card with Windows
drivers, there is no level control for voice commands in the Audio Control tool.
Creative Labs uses an "auto gain" feature that sets the level for you
automatically.

By default, when you install the Microsoft Windows Sound System with a
SoundBlaster Pro sound card, Windows Sound System sets the voice commands to the
microphone. However, the microphone input on the SoundBlaster Pro sound card
uses an "auto gain" feature that does not allow you to change the input. The
Windows Sound System microphone, which uses an adapter to amplify the microphone
to a line level, is always plugged into the line input of a true SoundBlaster
Pro sound card because a true SoundBlaster Pro sound card does not provide power
through its microphone input. Generally, you will want to use the Windows Sound
System microphone for voice commands, as well as for most microphone input,
because the SoundBlaster Pro sound card does not normally include a microphone.

Since there is no button for voice commands in the Audio Control tool in this
situation, it is difficult to change voice commands to line input. Normally, you
can double-click the volume control of the function in Audio Control of which
you want a detailed view; however, the Recording Control slider is not present
with the Creative Labs "auto gain" feature.
