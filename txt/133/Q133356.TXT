SUMMARY
=======

The Form Wizard adds either a TextBox or EditBox control to a Form for each
character field you add based on the length of the character field. If the
character field has more than 45 characters, the Form Wizard automatically adds
an EditBox control for that field; otherwise, it adds an TextBox control.
