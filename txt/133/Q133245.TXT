MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code to create the databases and tables needed. This
   example uses the existing sample database (Testdata.dbc), so you need to have
   the samples installed for this example to work.

         *
         * REPTSET.PRG: Setup code for duplicating problem
         *
         CLOSE ALL
         CREATE DATABASE CUSTVW
         CREATE SQL VIEW CUSTVW1 AS SELECT CUST_ID,COMPANY,MAXORDAMT;
            FROM C:\VFP\SAMPLES\DATA\TESTDATA!CUSTOMER
         OPEN DATABASE C:\VFP\SAMPLES\DATA\TESTDATA
         USE ORDERS
         COPY TO ORDER.DBF
         CLOSE ALL
         CREATE DATABASE CUSTOMER
         ADD TABLE ORDER
         USE ORDER
         INDEX ON CUST_ID TAG CUST_ID DESCENDING
         CLOSE ALL

2. Open the new databases Custvw and Customer.

3. Run the One-to-Many Report Wizard. (On the Tools menu, click Wizards, and
   then click Report.

4. From Custvw.dbc database, choose the Custvw1 view for the parent table and
   add all the fields.

5. From the Customer.dbc database, choose the Order table and several fields
   including Cust_Id. For example, choose Order_Id, Cust_Id and Order_Amt. Set
   Cust_Id is as the matching field for both tables in step 3.

6. Under Sort Order (step 4 of the Report Wizard), choose Cust_Id - descending.

7. Choose finish and preview. You will see that the report is in Cust_Id
   ascending order even though you specified descending order.
