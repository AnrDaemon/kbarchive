======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

NOTE: All references to WIN.INI and 16-bit installs relate only to Visual
SourceSafe 4.x. Version 5.0 is 32-bit only.

For Visual SourceSafe 4.0 to work correctly with Visual Basic and Visual C++, it
needs to make modifications to the Registry, WIN.INI (16-bit only), and VB.INI.
These modifications occur during a Client install, Custom install (SETUP.EXE),
or a Network Client install (NETSETUP.EXE). The Network Client install is only
available after a Server install has been performed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is what the Client setup script does to register the SourceSafe Visual
Basic Add-In and SCC DLL.


Registration Database Keys
--------------------------

These entries are created during 32-bit and 16-bit installations. In the
description below, {%INSTALLDIRECTORY%} is replaced with the path to the DLL.
For example, if you are installing into C:\SS4, then {%INSTALLDIRECTORY%} is
replaced with C:\SS4\WIN32 on 32-bit systems and C:\SS4\WIN on 16-bit systems.

      HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\SccAddIn.SourceCodeControlAddIn = Source Code Control
         Add-In
      HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\SccAddIn.SourceCodeControlAddIn\Clsid = {2F998FDA-
         3487-11CE-BCB6-00AA00688899}

      HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\SccAddIn.SourceCodeControlAddIn.1 = Source Code
         Control Add-In
      HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\SccAddIn.SourceCodeControlAddIn.1\Clsid = {2F998FDA-
         3487-11CE-BCB6-00AA00688899}

      HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{2F998FDA-3487-11CE-BCB6-00AA00688899} = Source
         Code Control Add-In
      HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{2F998FDA-3487-11CE-BCB6-00AA00688899}\ProgID =
         SccAddIn.SourceCodeControlAddIn.1
      HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{2F998FDA-3487-11CE-BCB6-00AA00688899}\ 
         VersionIndependentProgID = SccAddIn.SourceCodeControlAddIn
      HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{2F998FDA-3487-11CE-BCB6-00AA00688899}\ 
         InProcServer32 = {%INSTALLDIRECTORY%}Ssvb.dll
      HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{2F998FDA-3487-11CE-BCB6-00AA00688899}\ 
         InProcServer = {%INSTALLDIRECTORY%}Ssvb16.dll

The following registry entries are created on 32-bit installations only:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\SourceCodeControlProvider = Value:
         ProviderRegKey = Software\Microsoft\SourceSafe
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SourceSafe = Value: SCCServerPath
         = {%INSTALLDIRECTORY%}ssscc.dll
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SourceSafe = Value: SCCServerName
         = Microsoft Visual SourceSafe

WIN.INI File Modifications
--------------------------

These changes are made during on 16-bit installation only. {%INSTALLDIRECTORY%}
is replaced with the path to the DLL:

      [Source Code Control]
      SourceCodeControlProvider = SourceSafeSCCServer
      [SourceSafeSCCServer]
      SCCServerPath = {%INSTALLDIRECTORY%}ssscc16.dll
      SCCServerName = Microsoft Visual SourceSafe

VB.INI Entries
--------------

These entries are made during 16-bit and 32-bit installs. SourceSafe Setup
determines the location of VB.INI by:

1. Looking in the registry to figure out where the registered version of Visual
   Basic is.

2. Asking the user.

      [Add-Ins32]
      SccAddIn.SourceCodeControlAddIn=1

      [Add-Ins16]
      SccAddIn.SourceCodeControlAddIn=1
