PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error appears in the system log on a Windows NT server running the
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS):

   Event ID: 4281
   Source: WINS
   Type: Error
   Description: WINS encountered an error doing backup of the database to
   directory <path>.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when WINS attempts to create a backup of the WINS database
files and fails. The failure can be caused by an invalid local path or a
universal naming conversion (UNC) path.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. In WINS manager, choose Configuration from the Server menu. Set the Database
   Backup Path to a valid local path (for example, C:\WINNT35\SYSTEM32\WINS). Do
   not use a UNC path.

2. From the Mappings menu choose Backup Database. Backup the database to the
   same path used in step 1.

In most cases, this corrects the problem. However, if the problem persists:

1. In WINS manager, choose Configuration from the Server menu. Clear the
   Database Backup Path text box.

2. Stop the WINS server service.

3. Rename %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\WINS\SYSTEM.MDB to
   %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\WINS\SYSTEM.OLD.

4. Expand SYSTEM.MD_ to SYSTEM.MDB from the original installation media. Copy
   the file to the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\WINS directory.

5. Restart the WINS server service.

6. In WINS manager, choose Configuration from the Server menu. Set the Database
   Backup Path to a valid local path (for example, C:\WINNT35\SYSTEM32\WINS). Do
   not use a UNC path.

7. From the Mappings menu choose Backup Database. Backup the database to the
   same path used in step 6.
