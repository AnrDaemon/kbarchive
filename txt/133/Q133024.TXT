TITLE   :PRB: Error Loading File w/Combo Box RowSourceType = 6 (Fields)
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Executing a form containing a combo box or list box with the RowSourceType
property set to 6 (Fields), returns this error:

   Error Loading File - RowSource - Record <n> "field" phrase not found.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by incorrect syntax in the list of fields in the RowSource
property. The documentation and online Help imply that the correct way to list
fields in this property is:

   Table1.field1, Table1.field2, Table1.field3, ...

This is incorrect. The correct syntax is:

   Table1.field1, field2, field3, ...

Any deviation from this syntax (using an expression instead of a field name,
trying to use fields from multiple or related tables, and so on) results in the
same error message.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
