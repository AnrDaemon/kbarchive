SUMMARY
=======

Macro substitution treats the contents of a memory variable or array element as
a character string literal. When an ampersand (&) precedes a Character-type
memory variable or array element, the contents of the variable or element
replace the macro reference. You can use macro substitution in any command or
function that accepts a character string literal.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Language Reference, page 8, the (&) Ampersand command is explained.
One area of amplification to the Macro Substitution command is the .cExpression,
which allows for a continuation of the command.

Here is an example showing how objects can be referenced using macro
substitution:

     frmForm = CREATEOBJECT("Form")
      frmForm.SHOW
      X="frmForm"
      cMemvarIs="Visible"
      &X.&cMemvarIs =.F. && Nothing happens due to improper syntax
      &X..&cMemvarIs=.F. && The form should disappear
      WAIT WINDOW "Form should have disappeared."
      madd="AddObject"
      &X..Visible=.T. && The form should reappear
      &X..&madd("cmdMyButton2","cmdMyButton")
      myb="cmdMyButton2"
      &X..&myb..&mvis=.t.
      READ EVENTS

      DEFINE CLASS cmdMyButton AS CommandButton
         PROCEDURE Click
         ThisForm.RELEASE
         CLEAR EVENTS
         ENDPROC
      ENDDEFINE
