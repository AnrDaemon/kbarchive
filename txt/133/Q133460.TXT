-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Ancient Lands for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf version 1996-1997 for the Macintosh 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the multimedia titles listed at the top iof this article, you may
notice that some items on the Finder level (for example, the Finder desktop,
files or folders on the desktop, or the Apple logo in the upper left corner of
the monitor) have lost some or all of their color.

This problem occurs when the machine is configured for 256 colors.

CAUSE
=====

The multimedia titles for the Macintosh utilize colors from the computer's
internal color palette. If the computer doesn't make enough colors available,
the program attempts to optimize itself by taking colors away from other
sources, such as the Apple logo. After you quit the program, the Apple logo
returns to its original colors.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the computer can be configured to display more than 256 colors, change the
monitor settings using the following steps:

1. On the Apple menu, click Control Panels.

2. Open the Monitors Control Panel.

3. Click Thousands or Millions under the "Settings of selected monitor:"

4. Close the Monitors Control Panel.
