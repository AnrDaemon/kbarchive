TITLE   :Folders/Shortcuts Re-created When You Run Setup Again
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Setup to install Windows 95 over an existing installation of
Windows 95, some folders and shortcuts that you may have removed from the Start
menu are re-created.

The following actions can also re-create folders and shortcuts that you have
removed:

 - Running the following command:

   grpconv /m

 - Double-clicking a .grp file.

 - Double-clicking Runonce.exe in the Windows\System folder.

CAUSE
=====

When a Windows 3.x program group is converted, the .grp file is not removed from
the Windows folder. Each time you run Setup, it searches for and converts all
the .grp files.

RESOLUTION
==========

After you run Setup successfully, remove all the .grp files and the Progman.ini
file from the Windows folder.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During the Run Once portion of Setup, Setup searches for all the Windows 3.x
program group files and converts them to shortcuts on the Start menu. If you run
Setup (or the group converter tool or Runonce.exe) again, all the group files
are converted to shortcuts again.
