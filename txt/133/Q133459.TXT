SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to play an animation, you receive the error message

   Animations are not available when running in this screen mode

or the computer stops responding (hangs).

The error occurs when using the QVision 2000 video display driver in Microsoft
Windows version 3.x.


CAUSE
=====

The QVision 2000 Control Panel lists separate settings for Display, Virtual
Desktop, and Colors. The following Color settings can cause one of the above
symptoms:

   8-bit QCDP
   16-bit 65K colors
   24-bit 16.7M colors

NOTE: Microsoft Windows 95 includes a QVision 2000 video driver that plays
animations in Art Gallery correctly when configured for 256 colors.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the 8-bit 256 Colors to play animations. For more information about changing
you QVision 2000 settings, see your Compaq product documentation.

NOTE: The QVision 2000 video card will not work with the Microsoft SuperVGA video
driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The QVision 2000 Control Panel provides a ModeSWITCH feature which assigns hot
keys to different video display configurations. ModeSWITCH does not include the
8-bit 256 colors configuration and should not be used.
