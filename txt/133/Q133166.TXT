Encarta Manual Installation Instructions
----------------------------------------

If you encounter difficulties in setting up Encarta with the Setup program, you
will still be able to fully install and use Encarta by using a manual
installation and Manual.bat, a batch file that will copy files from the CD to
your hard disk.

Once the copying is completed, it may be necessary to run Setup.exe from the CD
as specified in the Encarta installation instructions.

Running Manual.bat
------------------

It is recommended that you exit Windows before running Manual.bat to prevent
possible difficulties with replacement of some system files.

The Manual.bat file is located in the x:\Aamsstp subdirectory of your Encarta CD
(where 'x' is the drive corresponding to your CD-ROM drive). The CD-ROM drive
will be referred to as [source] later in these instructions.

To run Manual.bat, change to the x:\amsstp subdirectory and type the following at
the MS-DOS prompt:

Manual [windows dir] [dest]

Where [windows dir] is the path to your Windows subdirectory (usually
C:\Windows)

[dest] is the path and directory to which you want to install Encarta (usually
C:\Encarta)

For example:

Manual C:\Windows C:\Encarta

installs Encarta to your C drive in the Encarta subdirectory and tells the batch
file that Windows is located on your C drive in the Windows subdirectory.

NOTE: If you do not provide the [windows dir] and the [dest], Manual.bat will
copy the files into an \Encfiles subdirectory in your Temp subdirectory. For
example: C:\Temp\Encfiles

The files can then be copied into the \Encarta, \Windows, and \Windows\System
subdirectories.

Important: Running Setup.exe
----------------------------

If you have not previously run Setup.exe from the Encarta disk, you should do so
after running the Manual.bat file.

When the above instructions have been completed, Encarta will be successfully
installed.
