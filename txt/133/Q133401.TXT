TITLE   :XFOR: Connector MTA Appears to Collect Mail It Shouldn't
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, an MS Mail connector (PC) MTA on a Microsoft
Exchange Server computer appears to collect messages that it shouldn't. An event
entry similar to the following is logged:

   Category:  Moved In
   Description:
   Date: 05/03/95
   Time:  18:43
   Message ID: 00000032
   Size: 1235
   FROM:  NETWORK/PO1/USER03
   TO:    NETWORK/PO3/USER45

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The log entry above is generated when a message is sent from PO1 to PO3,
indirectly through PO2. In the example, PO2 also happens to be the hub
connecting other postoffices to Microsoft Exchange.

The sample message is in error since no mail was actually moved into the
Microsoft Exchange server. A similar message will appear if the connector MTA
polls a postoffice that has messages queued up, waiting to be moved by an
additional instance of the MTA.

Additional query words: message transfer agent MTA External
