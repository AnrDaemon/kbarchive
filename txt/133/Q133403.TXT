TITLE   :XCON: Err Msg: The Recipient Name Is Not Recognized
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA), the
following nondelivery report message (NDR) is delivered to the sender when no
address space exists for at least the address type or the address routing
information on at least one of the Microsoft Exchange connectors:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   Subject: <Message Subject> Sent: <Date> <Time>

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

   '<Recipient's Address>' on 5/26/95 11:45:38AM The recipient name is not
   recognized

MORE INFORMATION
================

This message does not necessarily indicate that the recipient is invalid, but
rather that the MTA does not recognize the address type as a deliverable type.
Make sure the recipient address type is valid. You should verify that the
address spaces for the required connector contain at least the type of address
(X.400, SMTP, SNADS, MS, and so forth). This is done through the Address Space
property tab of the connector responsible for routing the mail to the
recipient.

The current gateway address routing table, the Gwart0.mta file located in the
Exchsrvr\MTAData directory, can also be viewed with a text editor to ensure that
the type of address being used is known by the MTA service. If not, the message
is rejected.

WARNING: Although you can view Gwart0.mta with a text editor, it should never be
modified with one. To do so may result in the MTA and/or Connectors not working
properly. To update Gwart0.mta, open the Site Addressing Object located under
the Site Configuration object, click on the Routing tab, then press the
Recalculate Routing button.

For more information on message routing and address spaces, consult the Microsoft
Exchange Server "Administrator's Guide."
