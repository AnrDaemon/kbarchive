-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you export a telephone number to the Timex Data Link watch through the
Schedule+ interface, phone numbers with more than 12 characters are truncated
from the right.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.

The Timex Data Link watch is designed to store telephone numbers with up to 12
digits. This design supports most phone numbers that are entered; however, when
you use an international prefix/country code at the beginning of the phone
number, the length of the phone number increases and the number exported to the
watch may be truncated starting from the right.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Timex Data Link watch is manufactured by Timex, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
