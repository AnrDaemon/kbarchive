The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Visual FoxPro for Windows "Developer's Guide," version 3.0, page 429
incorrectly states:

   "By default, forms open with the DataSession property set to 2 ..."

The DataSession Property setting of 2 is actually "Private Data Session."
The default setting for a DataSession within forms is 1, "Default Data
Session" as stated correctly in the Visual FoxPro Help file under the
"DataSession Property" topic.

Additional query words: VFoxWin
