======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The ClassWizard, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

ClassWizard creates incorrect code for a handler for the UDN_DELTAPOS
notification message of the CSpinButtonCtrl common control.

RESOLUTION
==========

The generated handler function will look like this (assuming that the
CSpinButtonCtrl is in a dialog):

     void CAboutDlg::OnDeltaposSpin1(NMHDR* pNMHDR, LRESULT* pResult)
         {
         NM_UPDOWN;
         // TODO: Add your control notification handler code here

         *pResult = 0;
         }

Modify the code to look like this:

     void CAboutDlg::OnDeltaposSpin1(NMHDR* pNMHDR, LRESULT* pResult)
         {
         NM_UPDOWN* pUpDown = (NM_UPDOWN*)pNMHDR;

         // TODO: Add your control notification handler code here

         *pResult = 0;
         }

By typecasting the pointer to the NMHDR structure, you can access additional data
that is passed after the NMHDR.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++, 32-bit
Edition, version 4.0.
