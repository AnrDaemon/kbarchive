SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to view fonts in Windows 95/98 and describes how to
determine if a font is damaged.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a font is not displayed correctly, or if a font file is not recognized as a
valid font, the font may be damaged.

If you determine that a font may be damaged, delete the font and then reinstall
the font from your original Windows 95/98 CD-ROM or disks or the disks provided
by the third-party font manufacturer.

Windows 95/98 stores fonts in the Windows\Fonts folder. Printer fonts and some
third party fonts, such as Adobe Type Manager fonts, may be installed to another
folder. Please see your third-party software documentation to identify the
folder where these fonts are installed.

Viewing Installed TrueType Fonts
--------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Fonts folder.

Viewing a Sample Font

information:

 - Name of the font

 - Type of font

 - Typeface name

 - File size

 - Version

 - Copyright information

 - Font sample

Printing Sample Fonts
---------------------
