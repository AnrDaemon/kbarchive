======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Use of "extern "C"" in source files that have a .C extension causes error C2059,
and results in this error message:

   error C2059:syntax error:'string'

CAUSE
=====

In the C language, the string-literal "C" is not recognized. It is used in C++
to prevent name decoration.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the string-literal "C" in extern declarations, or use the following in
the function declaration:

   #ifdef __cplusplus
      extern "C"
   #endif

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------------

   /* Compile options needed: None
      The following program reproduces the behavior if the source
      file has .C extension
   */ 

   #include <windows.h>

   extern "C" _declspec(dllexport) BOOL WINAPI function1(void);

   BOOL WINAPI DllMain ( HINSTANCE hInst, DWORD dwReason,
                           LPVOID lpReserved)
   {
      // Other required code goes here.
      return TRUE;
   }
