-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to find out how many records occur in each
group of a query that groups the records. You can do this by using the Query
Designer or the SQL statement it creates.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

This example uses the CUSTOMER.DBF table found in the VFP\SAMPLES\DATA
subdirectory. The example groups the table by Country, and produces a cursor
that has a record for each country with the number of records that appear in
that country.

1. On the File menu, click New, and then click Query. Base the query on
   VFP\SAMPLES\DATA\CUSTOMER.DBF.

2. Select the Fields tab on the Query Designer. Drag the Customer.country field
   onto the Selected Output box. In the Functions/Expressions combo box, select
   the COUNT() function, to count the Customer.country field. Click the Add >
   button to move this expression into the Selected Output box.

3. Select the Group By tab, and drag the Customer.country field onto the Group
   By Fields box.

4. Click the SQL button on the Query Designer toolbar to see the SQL statement
   that was just created. It should look like this:

      SELECT customer.country, COUNT(customer.country);
         FROM testdata!customer;
         GROUP BY customer.country

5. Close the SQL statement window. Click the exclamation button on the standard
   toolbar to run the query.
