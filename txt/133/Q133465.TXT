SYMPTOMS

Some or all of the Wine Guide movie control buttons are missing. The control
buttons are used to start, pause, forward and rewind a movie.

The problem may occur after you have done both of the following:

 - Paused the movie using the COMMAND+PERIOD shortcut key combination.

   -and-

 - Moved the movie dialog box to the right side of the monitor.

   When you moved the movie dialog box, part of the movie may have been hidden
   off the screen.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, close the movie dialog box, then reopen it. All the
control buttons for the movie should appear.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Wine Guide version 1.0 for the
Macintosh. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
