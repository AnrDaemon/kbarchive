 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade to Windows 95, the Novell NetWare workstation shell is not
upgraded to the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks on a computer running
LANDesk Manager.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 does not upgrade the NetWare shell if Setup detects that LANDesk
Manager's User.com tool is running.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either use the real-mode NetWare client to run User.com, or remove User.com from
the Autoexec.bat file, restart the computer, and install the Microsoft Client
for NetWare Networks.

STATUS
======

This situation is most likely caused by design changes in Windows 95. Microsoft
has confirmed that it is not caused by a problem in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LANDesk Manager's User.com requires the network to be started before it can be
loaded into memory.
