The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS and Microsoft SNA Server DOS
Client, the 3270 terminal emulator may display communication status 505 and then
stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

The incorrect computer name is called up during network initialization. SNA DOS
Client traces show the following:

   ... ... ... ... Remote box? <SNA_Server>:<Incorrect_SNA_Client>
   ...
   ... ... ... ... STAB entry <number> for box <Incorrect_SNA_Client>

where: <SNA_Server> is the Server name in SNA Server Admin,
<Incorrect_SNA_Client> is the incorrectly specified computer name of SNA
client, and <number> is the service table entry number.

This situation occurs when both the MS-DOS-based and Windows-based clients are in
the path. For example, your AUTOEXEC.BAT file contains the following:

   PATH C:\WINDOWS;C:\NET;C:\DOS;C:\;
   NET INITIALIZE
   NET START

In this case, the Windows for Workgroups version of NET.EXE is called first. The
Windows for Workgroups version of NET.EXE uses C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM.INI, instead of
C:\NET\SYSTEM.INI. This causes the error to occur.

The SYSTEM.INI contains the following entry for the SNA Client's computer name:

   [Network]
   ComputerName=<SNA_Client>

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following two methods to ensure the correct version of NET.EXE is
used:

 - Specify the complete path in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For example:

   C:\NET\NET INITIALIZE
   C:\NET\NET START

   -or-

 - Remove Windows from the Path statement. For example:

   :NET
   PATH C:\NET;C:\;
   NET INITIALIZE
   NET START
