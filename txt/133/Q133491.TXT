SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to add an IDE drive and controller to an computer,
with SCSI hardware, running Windows NT. This procedure may vary with your
particular system configuration. This article covers the following:

 - Create a New Windows NT Boot Disk

 - Set Up The New IDE Drive

 - Install Windows NT Boot Files On The New IDE Drive

 - Enable IDE Disk Support in Windows NT

MORE INFORMATION
================

Create a New Windows NT Boot Disk
---------------------------------

1. Under Windows NT, format a floppy disk.

2. Copy NTLDR, NTDETECT.COM, and BOOT.INI from your normal boot drive to the
   floppy disk. (These files may have the read-only, system, and hidden
   attributes).

3. Locate the driver for the SCSI controller that you currently boot from and
   copy it to the floppy disk as NTBOOTDD.SYS. For example, type the following
   for an Adaptec 1542 controller:

   copy %systemroot%\system32\drivers\aha154x.sys a:\ntbootdd.sys

4. Edit the BOOT.INI file on the floppy disk. Change each occurrence of multi to
   scsi.

5. Turn off the computer, install the IDE drive and controller, and restart the
   computer.

6. Make sure to change the CMOS settings to include the new drive. You should be
   able to boot from the floppy disk and have it boot the installation of
   Windows NT that is already on your SCSI drive.

Set Up The New IDE Drive
------------------------

1. Boot with a MS-DOS system disk.

2. Run FDISK.EXE and examine the partition information for the drive.

3. Create a partition on the IDE drive if necessary. Be careful to only make
   changes to the partition table on the IDE drive.

4. Quit FDISK and reboot. Format the drive as follows:

   FORMAT C: /S

5. Perform any additional setup of other media devices that may be required for
   MS-DOS to access your Windows NT installation media.

Install Windows NT Boot File On The New IDE Drive
-------------------------------------------------

1. Run Windows NT Setup. If you have the Windows NT CD-ROM and can access it
   from MS-DOS, run WINNT /B from the MS-DOS command prompt. This performs a
   floppyless installation.

2. When asked to reboot the computer, do so with an MS-DOS boot disk in Drive A.

3. Copy the BOOT.INI and NTBOOTDD.SYS files from the Windows NT Boot disk to the
   new IDE drive.

4. Delete the temporary Windows NT installation directory (if any) on the new
   IDE drive.

5. Remove the disk from the floppy drive and reboot the computer.

Enable IDE Disk Support In Windows NT
-------------------------------------

1. Copy the ATDISK.SYS file from the Windows NT installation media to the
   %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS directory.

2. In Windows NT, run Control Panel and choose Devices. Set the startup mode for
   ATDISK to System. If you want the newly added drive to be first in the order
   as they appear in Disk Administrator, change the startup mode to Boot.

3. Start the ATDISK driver from Control Panel.

4. Start Disk Administrator and make any changes necessary to the drive letter
   assigned to the new drive. If you do not choose a drive letter for the new
   drive, Windows NT will select a drive at the next reboot. This may cause
   existing drive letter assignments to change.

5. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.
