TITLE   :BUG: Use of Apostrophes in DSN Setup Not Allowed
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG# QJET: 2242 (2.00.2317)

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an apostrophe in the data source name (DSN) for a DSN definition
with an ODBC Desktop Database Driver version 2.0 driver, that DSN cannot be
accessed later using the Setup button of the ODBC Administrator. This type of
DSN also causes the ODBC Administrator to return an incorrect error message when
you try to delete the DSN with the Delete button in the ODBC Administrator.

The ODBC Administrator returns the message:

   The ODBC driver could not entirely delete the data source. Do you want to
   remove the entry anyway?

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not use apostrophes in data source names for the ODBC Desktop Database
Drivers version 2.0. If you want to use apostrophes in a DSN, you can do so and
use the DSN with ODBC, but it cannot be modified later using the Setup button of
the ODBC Administrator.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ODBC Desktop Database Drivers
version 2.00.2317. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 2.00.2317
