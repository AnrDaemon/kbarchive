on does not have an IPX network number.

   number.

   -or-

   configure it with a unique network number, and then shutdown and restart the
   Windows NT RAS server.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) on the RAS server.

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

      \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NwLnkIpx
        \NetConfig\<Network or RAS adapter>

3. Highlight NetworkNumber.
