The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An SQL SELECT command, using LOCFILE() or GETFILE() to find the source table or
using PUTFILE() to specify the destination table, may bring up the dialog box
for LOCFILE(), GETFILE(), or PUTFILE() twice.

WORKAROUND
==========

Store the return value of the LOCFILE(), GETFILE(), or PUTFILE() function in a
variable, and pass this variable to the SELECT command as a named expression
(that is, in parentheses) as in this example:

   cFilename=LOCFILE('','DBF','Select a Table')
      SELECT * FROM (cFilename)

   -or-

   cFilename=PUTFILE('Table','','DBF')
      SELECT * FROM <tablename> INTO TABLE (cFilename)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Run the following command:

   SELECT * FROM customer INTO TABLE PUTFILE()

The Save As dialog appears twice. To make it work correctly, modify it to:

   cFilename=PUTFILE()
      SELECT * FROM customer INTO TABLE (cFilename)
