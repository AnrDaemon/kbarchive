SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to play a sound (.wav) file, you may receive the following error
message:

   Sound Recorder cannot record or play back because a sound device is not
   installed. To install a sound device, click 'Add New Hardware' in Control
   Panel.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the "drivers=MMSYSTEM.DLL" entry is missing from the
[boot] section of the System.ini file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the following line to the [boot] section of the System.ini file:

   drivers=MMSYSTEM.DLL

If the line is present but has a semicolon (;) at the beginning, remove the
semicolon.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following the instructions in the error message does not eliminate the problem,
nor does removing and reinstalling the device in Device Manager. Removing and
reinstalling all multimedia components also does not eliminate the error
message.

This problem can also cause other symptoms. When you try to adjust the volume
using Mixer Control you may receive the following error message:

   There are no active mixer devices available. You may install or activate
   mixer devices from Control Panel. This application will now exit.

Media Player will run with this problem present, but the only device listed in
the Devices menu will be Video For Windows.
