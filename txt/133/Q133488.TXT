TITLE   :LPR Printing Fails After Setting Up Security
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A temp file is created in the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 subdirectory when you print
using the LPR monitor. This requires all users of this print share to have read,
write, delete privileges to this share. If security is applied to the
%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 directory revoking the required permissions, then printing
via LPR fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not already
done so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and 3.51.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
