TITLE   :Disabling Adaptec SCSI Chip in CMOS Hangs Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 may stop responding (hang) the first time it restarts after you run
Setup.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Adaptec AIC-6360 SCSI chip is disabled in your
computer's CMOS settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, disable the SCSI adapter in Device Manager. To do so,
follow these steps:

1. Start Windows 95 in Safe mode.

2. Use the right mouse button to click My Computer, then click Properties on the
   menu that appears.

3. On the Device Manager tab, double-click the SCSI Controller branch.

4. Click the SCSI adapter, then click Properties.

5. Click the Original Configuration check box to clear it, then click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Adaptec AIC-6360 SCSI chip is disabled in the computer's CMOS settings,
Windows 95 detects the device but cannot detect that it has been disabled. This
causes the miniport drivers for the SCSI device to attempt to load, and may
cause the system to hang
