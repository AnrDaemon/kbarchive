TITLE   :EPS Picture Appears Transparent on PCL Printers
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) graphic from PowerPoint 7.0 for
Windows 95 to a black-and-white PCL printer, parts or all of the EPS graphic may
appear to be transparent.

A PCL printer is a printer that uses the Hewlett-Packard Printer Control
Language. PCL printers include all HP LaserJet printers and LaserJet- compatible
printers.

CAUSE
=====

This is a bug in PCL banding printer drivers. The drivers do not preserve the
z-order, or "layering" of the objects in the EPS file, which in turn causes them
to appear as transparent.

NOTE: EPS graphics are designed to print well to printers that use the PostScript
page description language and not to printers that use other printer languages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PowerPoint version 7.0 for
Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

Convert the EPS graphic to another one of the supported graphic file formats
that PowerPoint is able to use, and then import the new version of the graphic
to your presentation. Many commercially available graphics and drawing software
packages can convert EPS graphics to other file formats.
