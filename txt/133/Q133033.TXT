PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The series of steps described under the More Information section is a process in
which someone mistakenly chooses to DO <*.PJX> file from the Visual FoxPro
user interface. Then the user gets a "Syntax error". Realizing a mistake was
made, the user opens the *.PJX file and runs the proper *.PRG file. When the
"Syntax error" appears again upon doing the *.PRG file, the user suspends the
error and brings up the Trace Window to find out where the error is. At that
point, a crash occurs in Visual FoxPro.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.
