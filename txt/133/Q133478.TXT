SYMPTOMS
========

When printing to a network printer a blank page may be printed at the end of the
print job. This can occur if the server has Default Datatype set to RAW[FF auto]
in the printer details on the server.

CAUSE
=====

The print processor incorrectly parses the data stream from some printers and
adds an extra form feed to the job when one already exists.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create two printers, one set to RAW[FF Auto] for printing from applications that
do not put a FF at the end of the job, usually MS-DOS applications.

Create the second printer with the Datatype set to RAW for printing from
applications that do put a FF at the end of the print job.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1 and 3.5.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
