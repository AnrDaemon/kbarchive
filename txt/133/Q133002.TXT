SUMMARY
=======

The AddColumn method allows a column to be added to a grid at run time. The new
ColumnCount for the grid is calculated differently depending on its value before
the column was added.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Grid.ColumnCount property is set to 1 or higher, the new ColumnCount
value is calculated by adding one to the existing ColumnCount value.

If the Grid.ColumnCount property is set to -1, the new ColumnCount value is
calculated by adding one to the number of fields in the table open in the
current work area. This behavior occurs because a value of -1 indicates that the
grid should include all fields from the current work area. The grid itself is
flexible and can change the number of columns based on the fields contained in
the underlying table. When a column is added to such a grid, the number of
columns must now be fixed to one more than the field count, and a static number
is required.
