TITLE   :PRB: Setup Error: Setup Parse Error in Initialize Pass
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setting up an EXE from distribution disks created by the Setup Wizard generates
this error:

   Setup Parse Error in Initialize pass Object ID2: AppSearch Object: Bad
   default path field

When you can click the OK button, the setup application fails.

CAUSE
=====

In Step 5 of the Setup Wizard, the developer has the option of setting a
destination directory for the application being distributed. This directory is
where setup program places the executable when a user installs the application.
The error is caused by the fact that the directory name specified by the
developer contains spaces or does not conform to directory name rules for a
particular operating system. This typically occurs when an application developed
on Windows 95 is being set up under Windows 3.1.

RESOLUTION
==========

The destination directory must be a valid directory for the platform. When
running the Setup Wizard for Visual FoxPro be sure the destination directory
name, in step 5, conforms to the 8.3 file/directory name format for backward
compatibility with previous versions of the Windows operating system.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior

It is assumed that the developer is running Visual FoxPro on the Windows 95
operating system.

1. Open an existing project, and build an executable file.

2. Close the Project.

3. On the Tools menu, click Wizards and then Setup.

4. Follow the steps in the Setup Wizard to locate the desired executable.

6. Complete the remaining Setup Wizard steps, and build distribution disks for
   your .EXE.

   application on a computer running Windows version 3.1 or Windows for
   Workgroups version 3.1 or 3.11.
