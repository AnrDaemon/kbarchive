The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use version 3.5 of the Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT
(NT MMTA) as a service under Microsoft Windows NT, you will not have control
over drive letter selection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each instance of the NT MMTA uses three drive letters, one for the home
postoffice and another two for inbound and outbound message transfer. When you
run the NT MMTA as a service, these drive letters are selected automatically by
the service. As a result, you will see up to three additional drive letters in
File Manager for each service instance.

NOTE: The NT MMTA service may use drive B, normally used for a floppy drive, if
that drive is not installed.

Additional query words: 3.50
