TITLE   :OLE Objects Don't Update with New Color Scheme
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbole

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you insert slides containing OLE objects (for example, Graphs or Organization
Charts) into an existing presentation by choosing Insert from the File menu,
then clicking Slides, the OLE objects do not update automatically to match the
existing color scheme.

This behavior is different from version 4.0 of PowerPoint for Windows.

CAUSE
=====

OLE objects are not activated when you insert slides from an external file.
Therefore, the objects do not realize the change in the container environment
and do not update.

RESOLUTION
==========

Method 1: For single objects:

a. Select the object to be updated.

b. If you have PowerPoint 7.0, click Recolor on the Tools menu. If you have
   PowerPoint 97, click Object on the Format menu, click the Picture tab, then
   click the Recolor button.

c. Click Entire Color Scheme, then click OK.

   The OLE objects should update to the new scheme.

Method 2: For multiple objects on multiple slides:

a. On the View menu, click Slide Sorter.

b. Select each slide that contains an affected object.

c. On the Format menu, click Slide Color Scheme.

d. Note the scheme being used.

e. Choose a different color scheme and click Apply.

f. On the Format menu, click Slide Color Scheme.

g. Reselect the scheme noted in step d above and click Apply.

   The OLE objects should update to the new scheme.
