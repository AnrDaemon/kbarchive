PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Microsoft Exchange client to access a Microsoft Mail 3.0, 3.2, or
3.5 postoffice with the Microsoft Mail Information Provider, a Mail message's
Received Time Stamp is not correct when the message crossed a time zone.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Delivery time is obtained from the time stamp in the .MBG record. This time
stamp is the local time of the sender for backward compatibility reasons with
Mail 3.2. There is no time zone information stored in the mail message.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.
