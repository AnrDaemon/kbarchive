When you try to copy a file in Windows Explorer to a Plus Hard Card XL II drive,
you may receive a blue error screen with the following error message:

   Disk Write Error, unable to write to drive <X>:, press any key to

The real-mode driver for the Plus Hard Card XL II is not being loaded in the
Config.sys file.

following line to the file

where <path> is the path to the Atdosxl.sys file. After you save and close
the Config.sys file, restart your computer.

STATUS
======
