SUMMARY
=======

This article lists known issues with scrolling in chat sessions on The Microsoft
Network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you select text in the Chat History pane, you can select only the text
visible in the pane. That is, the pane does not scroll as you select. If you
want to copy and paste text, you must do so one pane at a time.

If you scroll back in the Chat History pane and then send a message, the Chat
History pane does not scroll down far enough to display the entire message that
you sent. If you use the scroll arrows to scroll enough to see the whole
message, the same behavior occurs the next time you send a message. To work
around this behavior, scroll a few lines past the end of the last message.

When you use the keyboard to move the insertion point up in the Chat History pane
and you reach the top of the pane, the insertion point disappears. This occurs
because the insertion point is still scrolling up, but into a non-visible
region. The text does not scroll as you move the insertion point up. Moving the
insertion point back down makes it reappear.
