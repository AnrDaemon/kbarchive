TITLE   :Unable to Stop Success Logon Audits on Backup Domain Controller
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Audit policy for a domain is set to log failed logons only, the backup
domain controllers in the domain incorrectly logs the successful and failed
logons that it validates. The primary domain controller logs only failed logon
attempts as expected.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. On the backup domain controller (BDC) go into User Manager.

2. From the Policies menu choose auditing and check the box Auditing For
   Successful Logons.

3. Then uncheck the box Auditing For Successful Logons.

This then fixes the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
