TITLE   :PIFs Are Not Created in the PIF Folder

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Program information files (PIFs) for MS-DOS-based programs are not created in
the Windows\PIF folder.

CAUSE
=====

When you double-click an MS-DOS-based program file (.exe or .com file) in
Windows Explorer, a PIF is created in the same folder as the program file. If
the PIF cannot be created in the same folder (such as when you run a program
from a CD-ROM), the PIF is created in the Windows\PIF folder. The PIF has the
same filename as the program file, but with a .pif extension.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
