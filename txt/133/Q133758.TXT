TITLE   :BUG: Mismatched User32.dbg File on Windows NT 3.51 CD-ROM Disc
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Visual C++, Setup creates an icon for the Setupdbg.exe utility
called "NT System Symbols Setup." On running this utility to install the Windows
NT symbol files (.DBG files), you are prompted to enter the full path to your
Windows NT distribution files. If you specify a path to the Windows NT 3.51
CD-ROM drive, you encounter the following message:

   The version of the file 'USER32.DBG' does not match the
   corresponding dll on your machine. Do you want to copy it?

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT 3.51 CD-ROM compact disc contains an incorrect version of the
User32.dbg file.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can debug applications with Visual C++ without this file installed. However,
the Visual C++ debugger will not be able to determine the context of functions
located in User32.dll.

The User32.dbg file included in the Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) is
correct, so installing the Windows NT symbol files (.dbg files) from the Win32
SDK CD-ROM compact disc will work correctly. You can also copy this file
directly from the Win32 SDK into your \Windows\Symbols\Dll directory.

Alternatively, you can obtain the same correct User32.dbg file by downloading
User32.exe from the Microsoft Download Center.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

   User32.exe
   (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc40subscrption/Utility/1/W9XNT4/EN-US/USER32.EXE)
