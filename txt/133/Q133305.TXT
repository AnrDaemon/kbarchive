The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how the LAN Manager version 2.2 MS-DOS Enhanced
workstation can be installed over the network from a Windows NT server provided
the Over-the-Network (OTN) installation share has been previously created on a
LAN Manager version 2.2 server, and the OTN installation share directory
structure is still available. This article assumes that you have already
performed successful OTN installations as described in Chapter 5 of the LAN
Manager Installation and Configuration Guide.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install a LAN Manager 2.2 MS-DOS Enhanced workstation over the network from a
Windows NT server:

1. Transfer the existing OTN installation share from a LAN Manager version 2.2
   server to a Windows NT server. The directory structure must be duplicated
   exactly. For example, create a NINSTALL directory on the Windows NT server,
   and then copy all files and subdirectories from the LAN Manager server
   NINSTALL directory to the Windows NT server NINSTALL directory.

2. If the new OTN installation share is in a different domain than the original,
   edit the installation template files (*.TEM) on the Windows NT server to show
   the correct domain entry as follows:

   Domain = <domain>

3. Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file on the OTN installation boot disks to point to the
   correct server and OTN share as follows:

   net use <drive_letter>: \\<server>\<share>

4. Share the NINSTALL directory on the Windows NT server, and give the group
   Everyone the Read permission.

5. Enable the Guest account so it does not require a password.

6. Boot MS-DOS workstations with the OTN installation floppy disk and install
   LAN Manager.
