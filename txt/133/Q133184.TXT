TITLE   :ATAPI CD-ROM Drive Not Accessible with PCMCIA Devices
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade or install Windows NT 3.51 on a laptop computer with two
enhanced IDE (EIDE) controllers and an ATAPI-compatible CD-ROM drive, the
following system event appears in the Event Viewer:

   Event: 9
   Source: ATAPI
   Type: Error
   Description: The device \Device\ScsiPort0 - did not respond within the timeout
   period.

The CD-ROM icon is not available in File Manager.


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the secondary EIDE controller (used for the CD- ROM)
and a PCMCIA card are configured with the same IRQ.

Some PCMCIA cards (type I, II, or III) are shipped with the IRQ configured for
IRQ 15. Some EIDE controllers, by default, are also set to IRQ 15.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Verify that the CD-ROM drive operates:

   a. Remove all drivers for the PCMCIA cards.

   b. Turn off your computer and remove all PCMCIA cards.

   c. Restart Windows NT and verify that the CD-ROM drive icon appears in File
      Manager. If the CD-ROM drive icon does not appear in File Manager, contact
      your CD-ROM drive manufacturer.

2. If you have already installed the drivers for the PCMCIA cards, change the
   IRQ to another unused IRQ. If not, install the driver for an unused IRQ.

3. Turn off your computer and insert all PCMCIA cards.

4. Restart Windows NT.
