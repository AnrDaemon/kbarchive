PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you modify a desktop theme to use sounds other than the default sounds,
some of the sounds may not work correctly even though the .wav files exist and
are in the proper location. This problem can also occur when you apply a custom
desktop theme.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if a .wav file's filename contains a comma.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename any .wav file whose filename contains a comma. To rename a file, use the
right mouse button to click the file, then click Rename on the menu that
appears.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you apply a theme, the theme switcher tries to confirm that all the .wav
files used in the theme exist. Filenames containing a comma are truncated at the
comma by the theme switcher.
