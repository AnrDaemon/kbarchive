TITLE   :Using Microsoft Mouse 9.01 Mouse Manager in Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to Windows 95 on a computer with the Microsoft Mouse driver
version 9.01 installed, you may not be able to use Mouse Manager. When this
occurs, features such as Snap-To, Locate, Screen Wrap, and Magnify do not work.

CAUSE
=====

The folder containing the Mousemgr.dll file is not in the search path.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable Mouse Manager, use either of the following methods:

 - Add the folder containing the Mousemgr.dll file to the search path.

 - Move the Mousemgr.dll file to a folder that is in the search path.

After you use either of these methods, restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Mousemgr.dll file is placed in the C:\Mouse folder by default. If you need
to replace the file, expand it from the original Microsoft Mouse disk using the
following steps:

1. Place the Microsoft Mouse 9.01 disk in the appropriate floppy disk drive.

2. Type the following line at an MS-DOS command prompt

   <fdisk>:\expand <fdisk>:\mousemgr.dl$
   <hdisk>:\<windows>\mousemgr.dll

   where <fdisk> is the drive letter of the floppy disk drive containing
   the Microsoft Mouse disk, <hdisk> is the drive letter of the hard disk
   on which Windows 95 is installed, and <windows> is the folder
   containing Windows 95.

For example,

   a:\expand a:\mousemgr.dl$ c:\<windows>\mousemgr.dll

   where <windows> is the folder containing Windows 95.
