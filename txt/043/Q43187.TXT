The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a new Mail message arrives, a solid black diamond appears next to the
Microsoft Mail desk accessory (DA) on the Apple menu. This diamond appears when
the Display Flashing Menu Bar Icon selection is set in the Mail Preferences
dialog box and you are using Apple System software version 6.0.2 through 6.08.

When the message arrives, a small icon representing the message type flashes
above the Apple in the menu bar. When you open the Apple menu, a solid black
diamond appears next to the Microsoft Mail desk accessory, which indicates that
this DA requires your attention.

The diamond disappears when the new message is read. Opening and closing Mail
without reading the message does not remove the diamond.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
