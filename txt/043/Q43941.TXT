The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Mail Address Mail window, clicking the Add button and clicking
the Search button perform similar functions; however, there is a difference.

Clicking the Add button or pressing the ENTER key searches the list of users for
names that BEGIN with the string of characters typed in the Type Names text box.
If any names are found, they are displayed in the Choose Names list.

Clicking the Search button or pressing COMMAND+S searches the list of users for
names that CONTAIN the string of characters typed in the Type Names text box. If
any names are found, they are displayed in the Choose Names list.

In Mail version 3.X00, the Search button has been renamed to "Find Name" and the
key equivalent is COMMAND+F. Find Name searches for names in the same manner as
the Search button.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, suppose you type "Ma" (without the quotation marks) in the Type
Names text box and the list of users contains the following four names:

   Bob Mack
   Chis Kinman
   Martha Jones
   Mary Smith

1. If you click the Add button, the names that BEGIN with "Ma" are displayed in
   the Choose Names list. In this example, the following names are displayed:

   Mary Smith
   Martha Jones

2. If you click the Search (or Find Names) button, the names that CONTAIN the
   string of characters "Ma" are displayed in the Choose Names list. In this
   example, the following names are displayed:

   Bob Mack
   Chis Kinman
   Martha Jones
   Mary Smith
