When you use the spooler during a print job, do not use the Control
Panel (or any other method) to change the connections of the currently
active printer.

For example, if a job is currently printing to a LaserJet on LPT2, do
not try to connect an Epson to that port (and change the LaserJet to
something else), and do not try to change the LaserJet to a different
port until the print job is done. Doing so may result in the loss of
the rest of the print job or in severely garbled output.

This information also applies to Windows/386.
