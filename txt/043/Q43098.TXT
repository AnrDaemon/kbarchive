MORE INFORMATION
================

Please note that the Mail server maintains two lists of users: a list of local
users, and a list of all users as seen in the Address Mail window. The Mail
server does not update its list of all users until it broadcasts its new list of
local users to other Mail servers on the network. It may take a short while for
the new users to show up in your server's list of all users; however, they
should appear in the list of local users immediately.
