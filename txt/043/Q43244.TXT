TITLE   :Mac Wkst Srv: Auto Login Not Working on Server Macintosh
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Mail, on the server Macintosh, if the workstation software has been
renamed so it loads before the "Microsoft Mail Server" server software, the
automatic sign-in feature will not work.

CAUSE
=====

To allow automatic sign-in to work, the server software must load before the
workstation attempts to automatically sign in. The Mail 3.0 and 3.1 workstation
software is named "MS Mail."


On the Macintosh, memory-resident software (such as Microsoft Mail) loads
alphabetically. If you view the System Folder by name, you can tell if the
workstation software has been loaded before the server software.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, rename the workstation software so it falls
alphabetically after the server software, then restart your Macintosh.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This situation can also arise when you use the Microsoft Mail server as an
application. Because applications always load after INITs/Extensions, the Mail
server will never be available for login when the workstation is loading.
Automatic Login is not possible when you are running the Mail server as an
application.
