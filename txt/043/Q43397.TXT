SUMMARY
=======

The following information describes the file-access, file-sharing, and
inheritance codes used with MS-DOS Interrupt 21h Function 3Dh that are
compatible with the Windows OpenFile() API.

A call to the OpenFile() API that specifies OF_CREATE as the value for the wStyle
parameter is translated into a call to the MS-DOS Create File with Handle
function (Interrupt 21h Function 3Ch). Because Windows does not pass any style
bits (other than OF_CREATE) to MS-DOS, the file is always created with normal
attributes.

A call to the OpenFile() API that does not specify OF_CREATE is translated into a
call to the MS-DOS Open File with Handle function (Interrupt 21h Function 3Dh).
Windows places the value of the low- order byte of the wStyle parameter into the
AL register to specify file-access and file- sharing codes.

NOTE: The sharing bits take effect only if the MS-DOS SHARE utility is running on
a system.

Additional query words: 3.00 no32bit 3.10
