The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail, only the Network Manager can modify user names. On the other
hand, both users and the Network Manager can modify a password.

If you are the Network Manager, do the following to modify a user's name or
password:

1. Log in as Network Manager.

2. With the Summary window open, choose Server User/Groups from the Mail menu.


3. Select the Users icon.

4. Select Modify User.

5. Select the user's name in the list box.

6. Make any changes to the user's name or password.

7. When you are done modifying the current user, click Modify.

8. If you need to modify more users, repeat steps 5 through 7, then click the
   Close box.

A user can change his or her password as follows:

1. With the Summary window open, choose Change Password from the Mail menu.

2. Type the new password and click OK. For security, when you type your
   password, bullets are displayed in the password text box. You should be very
   careful when you type your new password because you cannot see on the screen
   which keys you are typing. You are then asked to type your password a second
   time for verification.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Please note that the Mail server maintains two lists of users: a list of local
users and a list of all users as seen in the Address Mail window. The Mail
server does not update its list of all users until it broadcasts its new list of
local users to other Mail servers on the network. It may take a short time for
the modified users to show up in your server's list of all users; however, the
modified users should appear immediately in the list of local users.
