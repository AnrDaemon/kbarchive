SUMMARY
=======

To modify a user group in Microsoft Mail, do the following:

1. Log in as Network Manager on the Mail server where the groups were created.

2. With the Summary window open, choose Server Users/Groups from the Mail menu.


3. Click the Group icon.

4. Select Modify Group.

5. In the List box, select the group you want to modify.

6. Add users to or remove users from the group by clicking the Address Group
   icon. Note that you can add only existing users to a group; you cannot add
   users who currently do not have an account on the Mail system. If you are
   trying to add a user or group that was just created, this name or group may
   not display in the user list; it takes a few minutes for the name or group to
   be recorded in the global list. In this case, close the Address window for a
   few minutes and then try it again.

   For more information on using the Address Group window, query on the following
   words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   address and group and window

7. When you have finished adding or removing users and have returned to the
   Users And Groups window, click the Modify button.

8. Click the close box.
