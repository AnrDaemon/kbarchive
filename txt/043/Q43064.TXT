SUMMARY
=======

In NMAKE, the backslash "\" character has two different meanings depending on
the context in which it is used. It can be used as a line- continuation
character or as a path specifier.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The backslash is used primarily as a line-continuation character. For example,
if a dependency line in your makefile extends to more than one line, use the
backslash to continue it to the next line. You can place a space prior to the
backslash or append it directly to the last dependent file, as the following
examples demonstrate:

TARGET1: obj1 obj2 obj3 obj4 obj5 \
obj6 obj7

TARGET2: obj1 obj2 obj3 obj4 obj5\
obj6 obj7

NMAKE also uses the backslash as a path specifier. When a backslash is the last
character on a line and is used as a path specifier, place a caret "^" character
before the backslash to override its default use as a line-continuation
character.

The following macro definition demonstrates using the backslash as a path
specifier.

   exe_dir = c:\bin^\ 

In the following case, NMAKE interprets the trailing backslash as a
line-continuation character which is contrary to the meaning the context
requires:

   exe_dir = c:\bin\ 

In a macro, specifying two backslashes in succession ("\\") nullifies its use as
a line-continuation character. However, when NMAKE expands the macro, both
backslash characters appear and an incorrect path results.
