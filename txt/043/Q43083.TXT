TITLE   :DOSSHELL Returns to DOS after Executing Batch File

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you execute a batch file from DOSSHELL, you are not returned to the
DOSSHELL when the batch file is finished. Instead, you are returned to the
MS-DOS prompt.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because you are not using the following syntax in your
Commands field of the Add Program dialog box:

   CALL FOOT.BAT

If you neglect to use the CALL statement, the batch file does not return properly
to the calling program. Instead, it returns you to the MS-DOS command prompt
because the DOSSHELL also has its own batch command language, slightly different
from that used by COMMAND.COM. The CALL is necessary to inform the DOSSHELL that
the file should be CALLed as a normal MS-DOS batch file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about the use of batch files from the Microsoft MS-DOS 4.0
Shell, refer to Page 101 of the "Microsoft MS-DOS Shell User's Guide" manual.
