SUMMARY
=======

Libraries are reference counted and remain resident in memory until they cease
to be referenced.

When a task module is started and is dynamically linked to the library, the
reference count is incremented by 1 (one). When the task module is terminated,
the reference count is decremented by 1 (one).

Two functions, LoadLibrary() and FreeLibrary(), affect the reference count.
LoadLibrary() increments the reference count by one while FreeLibrary()
decrements the reference count by one.

Additional query words: 3.00 no32bit 3.10
