SUMMARY
=======

There are three different types of libraries used in Windows. These three types
of libraries are defined as follows:

1. Object libraries are produced by LIB.EXE, and consist of Intel object code;
   for example, SWLIBC.LIB (the W implies the objects were compiled using
   Windows prolog conventions).

   Object libraries, which are sometimes more accurately called static link
   libraries, are the libraries that contain object code. These libraries are
   used at link time to resolve statically linked calls.

2. DLLs (Dynamic-Link Libraries) are produced by IMPLIB.EXE and LIB.EXE, and
   contain dynamic-link records derived from GDI.DEF, USER.DEF, and KERNEL.DEF.
   They also contain the Windows startup routine, WINSTART.OBJ, and any routines
   necessary to override C run-time functions (for example, calloc and malloc);
   that is, Windows-specific run-time functions.

   NOTE: The term Dynamic-Link Library or DLL is usually used to describe the
   actual Windows executable that implements a particular API.

   The term import library is usually used to describe the product of the IMPLIB
   utility. This library is used to resolve references to DLL exports at the
   time the application is linked.

3. Executable libraries are produced by the Microsoft linker program (LINK.EXE),
   and use the keyword LIBRARY in the .DEF file. They contain sharable Windows
   code, for example, GDI.EXE, USER.EXE, or KERNEL.EXE.
