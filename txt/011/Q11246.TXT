SUMMARY
=======

In Windows, changing the screen background color or the test color will affect
the following programs:

   Notepad        MS-DOS Executive
   Clock          PIF Editor
   Control        Spooler Panel
   Calendar       Terminal
   Clipboard      Write

However, the following programs are not affected:

   Calculator     Reversi
   Cardfile       COMMAND.COM
   Paint

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is up to the application to look in the WIN.INI file to see what [color]
preferences are selected. Some applications do not change because either they do
not look in the WIN.INI file for those colors, or the applications choose to
ignore them.

For an application to be aware of system color changes, the WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE
message must be used in the Windows procedures.

For example, suppose a static hBrush is in the WndProc for repaint purposes. To
be aware of system color changes, update the brush based on system color changes
by doing something similar to the following:

       case WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE:

       DeleteObject(hBrush);
       hBrush = CreateSolidBrush(GetSysColor(COLOR_WINDOW));
       return 0;
