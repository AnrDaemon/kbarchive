======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 1.25, 1.27, 3.0x, 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ASSUME directive in the macro definition below is not displayed in the list
file. The documentation states that all the directives can be developed.

The following is an example:

      BEGIN   MACRO   x
      x       SEGMENT PUBLIC
      ASSUME  CS:x,DS:x
              ENDM

      BEGIN   NewSeg
              IRET
      NewSeg  ENDS
              END

CAUSE
=====

By default, directives are not listed inside of macros. The only lines listed
from macro expansions are ones that generate code or data.

RESOLUTION
==========

You should use the .LISTMACROALL directive (.lall in all versions prior to 6.0)
if you want to see these lines.

Additional query words: 1.25 1.27 3.0x 4.00 5.00 5.10 6.00
