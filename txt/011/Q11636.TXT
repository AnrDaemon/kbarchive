SUMMARY
=======

Numbered resources in Windows must start at one, not zero. Beginning with the
MS-DOS version 4.0 executable format, executable segments are numbered from one,
and resources are implemented as independent segments. Therefore, resources are
numbered from one.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
