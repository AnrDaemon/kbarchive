TITLE   :PRB: MAPSYM 3.10 Truncating Line-Number Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using Version 3.10 of the MAPSYM utility that came with the Windows Development
Toolkit, you get an incorrect entry point (Program entry point at 0000:0000) for
.SYM files and the map-file information (the line numbers) are truncated. You
use close to 100 segments and generate more than 1000 line numbers.

CAUSE
=====

Version 3.10 of MAPSYM has a limitation of 10,000 symbols and 150 segments.
Additionally, if a pathname and segment name line (in the map-file line
numbering) is greater than 80 characters, the line-number information is
truncated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, shorten this line to less than 80 characters. For
example, change the following line

   Line numbers for D:\TESTER\C\FILENAME.OBJ(d:\tester\c\filename.c)
   segment filename_TEXT

   to this:

   Line numbers for D:\FILENAME.OBJ(d:\filename.c) segment filename_TEXT

Additional query words: 3.10 no32bit
