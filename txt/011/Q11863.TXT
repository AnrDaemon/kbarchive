SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to determine the printable area for a printer in
Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Escape(GETPHYSPAGESIZE) specifies the size of the physical sheet of the
currently selected paper size; for example, 8 1/2 by 11 for letter-sized paper
on the Epson FX-80.

Escape(GETPRINTINGOFFSET) specifies how far in and how far down the printable
area starts on the sheet of paper; for example, 1/4 inch in and 1/8 inch down
for the Epson.

GetDeviceCaps(HORZSIZE) specifies the width of the printable area on the page, in
millimeters (8 inches for the Epson).

GetDeviceCaps(VERTSIZE) specifies the length of the printable area on the page,
in millimeters (10 inches for the Epson).

GetDeviceCaps(HORZRES) specifies the width of the printable area on the page, in
pixels. Note that this value will depend on the currently selected graphics
resolution (960 for the Epson at 120 x 72 DPI or 120 x 144 DPI, 1920 for the
Epson at 240 x 144 DPI).

GetDeviceCaps(VERTRES) specifies the length of the printable area on the page, in
pixels. Note that this value will depend upon the currently selected graphics
resolution (720 for the Epson at 120 x 72 DPI, 1440 for the Epson at 120 x 144
DPI or 240 x 144 DPI).

If pixels per inch are desired, GetDeviceCaps(LOGPIXELSX and LOGPIXELSY) gives
the number of pixels per inch in each direction (120 per inch horizontal, 72 per
inch vertical for Epson). Please note that these arguments were not documented
prior to Windows version 3.0.

Device coordinates are returned; therefore, conversion to logical coordinates is
necessary before drawing with GDI.

The origin of the printable area is 0,0. The rectangle that defines the printable
area is as follows:

      left = 0
      top  = 0
      right = GetDeviceCaps (HORZSIZE)
      bottom = GetDeviceCaps (VERTSIZE)

Using the above example for the Epson, the paper is 8 1/2 by 11 inches.
Horizontally, the printable area goes from 1/4 inch to 8 1/4 inches; vertically,
the printable area goes from 1/8 inch from the top to 10 1/8 inches.
