SUMMARY
=======

The text below discusses the process through which an application can modify the
PROMPT environment variable in a spawned process. Use the same procedure to
modify any environment variable in a spawned process.

PROMPT is an environment variable used by MS-DOS, OS/2, and Windows NT. To change
the value for the PROMPT environment variable, use one of the following two
methods to specify the environment in which a child process runs.

 - Use one of the spawn*e() functions. See the run-time library reference manual
   or the online help file provided with your compiler for specific information
   about the spawn() family of functions.

 - Use the putenv() function to modify the environment in which your application
   executes, then start the child process with one of the spawn() functions. See
   the run-time library reference manual or the online help file provided with
   your compiler for specific information about the putenv() function.

In general, a process can alter only the environment in which a child process
will run. The C run-time library functions simulate the ability to alter the
environment space in which the current process runs by making a copy of the
environment when the process starts up and allowing the process to modify the
copy of the environment.
