The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail, the error message "Unknown name" or "Incorrect Password" is
displayed during the automatic sign-in if one of the following is true:

 - The Network Manager or the user changed the name or password. In this case,
   the automatic sign-in routines still have the old name or password recorded.
   For Mail to enter the new name or password, the user must update the
   name/password information in the Mail Sign-In Preferences window.

 - The user switched servers during the previous session. To connect to the
   correct server, cancel the auto sign-in and reselect the server you are
   trying to connect to.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a user uses the automatic sign-in feature of Mail, choosing a different
server during the same session overwrites the server name and network zone
recorded in the auto sign-in routines.

For example, a user has two accounts on two different servers: on SERVER-A, the
account name is "Joe Doe"; on SERVER-B, the account name is "Mr Doe".

The user automatically signs in on SERVER-A (as Joe Doe). He checks his mailbox
and then decides to sign in on SERVER-B (as Mr Doe). If he restarts the
Macintosh now, the Mail auto sign-in procedure will display the error message
"Unknown name." The name used in the auto sign-in is still "Joe Doe"; however,
the server is now SERVER-B, which is the last server the user was connected to.
