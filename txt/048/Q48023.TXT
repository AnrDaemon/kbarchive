SUMMARY
=======

We are not aware of any kind of Windows-to-Macintosh interpreter or translator
that will allow you to directly run Windows code on the Macintosh, but there are
some alternatives:

1. The January 1989 issue of the "Microsoft Systems Journal" contains two
   relevant articles titled "Developing Applications with Common Source Code for
   Multiple Environments" and "Porting Apple Macintosh Applications to the
   Microsoft Windows Environment."

2. The "Windows Developer Guidebook" [available by calling (800) 426-9600]
   contains a listing for a product that helps you develop code in an
   environment-independent way. The product is called XVT (Extensible Virtual
   Toolkit) for Microsoft Windows, Presentation Manager, and Macintosh. XVT is
   made by the following company:

   GSS (Graphical Software Systems)
   9590 SW Gemini Drive
   Beaverton, OR 97005
   (503) 643-8642

   According to GSS, "XVT allows developers to create and maintain one set of
   source code and port it to Windows, PM, and Macintosh environments."


3. A third-party product called CommonView contains Glockenspiel C++ object
   libraries to simplify creation of applications for Windows and OS/2
   Presentation Manager (PM) using the same core source code. Contact the
   company to find out more about porting to the Macintosh.

   CommonView is a set of class libraries for creating Microsoft Windows and PM
   applications. They come with the C++ compiler, which is an object-oriented
   version of C. They are actually translators that translate C++ code into C
   code, which you can then run through your C compiler. You can write an
   application using CommonView, and it will isolate you from the particular
   Windows environment. The product is distributed by Imagesoft, (800) 245-8840
   or (516) 767-2233.

XVT and CommonView are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make
no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or
reliability.
