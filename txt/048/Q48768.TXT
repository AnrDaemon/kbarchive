The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When more than one Microsoft Mail server is installed on a single network zone,
it is not easy to determine which server is on which Macintosh by looking at the
names in the Chooser window, unless the servers were named as they were
installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the servers were installed without being named, do the following to determine
which server is on which Macintosh:

1. Shut down all the Mail servers.

2. Remove every Mail server from the network (that is, unplug the network
   cable).

3. Boot the Mail servers.

4. On each server, select the Chooser and click the MS Mail driver. Note that
   the Mail 3.0 driver is named "MS Mail" and the Mail 2.0 driver is named "MS
   Mail 2.0". On the right side of the Chooser window, only one server should be
   seen. This is the Mail server installed on that specific Macintosh.

The name of the server is not located anywhere on the Installer disk. Once you
have determined which server is on which Macintosh, write the name on the label
of the Installer disk (the disk used on that Macintosh). If the server is to be
renamed, the new name should also be written on the label of the Installer disk.
