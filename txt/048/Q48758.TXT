TITLE   :Vertical Speed Indicator Overreacts in Flight Simulator
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The vertical speed indicator always reads higher than is indicated both by the
actual flight conditions and by the altimeter.

The vertical speed indicator seems to overreact and to remain high when there are
fluctuations in the altitude, but reads accurately when in a steady climb.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
