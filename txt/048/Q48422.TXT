The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, MS-DOS workstation, versions 1.37, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b, 3.1, 3.1a, 3.1c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 1.37 of the Microsoft Mail PC Client was not tested with AppleShare PC
version 2.0. Microsoft does not guarantee the performance of the Mail 1.37 PC
Client if you use it with AppleShare PC. You should unload the Mail Notifier
from memory before running AppleShare PC by typing "notifier off" (without
quotation marks) at the MS- DOS prompt.

If you load the Mail Notifier over the software modules (ASHARE.COM, APRINT.COM,
MINSES.EXE, and REDIR.EXE) required to run AppleShare PC, you may encounter one
of the following problems:

1. If you try to run the AppleShare desk accessory (DA.EXE), you receive the
   message "AppleTalk driver not installed."

2. If you try to print to a printer selected through the AppleShare desk
   accessory (DA), the computer beeps and the printer generates no output.

MORE INFORMATION
================

AppleShare PC was released after Microsoft Mail PC Client version 1.37 and
therefore was not tested with version 1.37. Microsoft Mail PC Client version 2.0
and Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.0 were tested for
compatibility with AppleShare PC version 2.0.

The Mail Notifier, like the AppleShare PC desk accessory, is a terminate-
and-stay-resident (TSR) program. TSR programs remain in memory while you run
other programs. It is not unusual for multiple TSRs running at the same time to
conflict with each other.
