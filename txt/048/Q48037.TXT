SUMMARY
=======

The following are the three ways to select recipients of Microsoft Mail
messages:

Method 1
--------

Select user names from the Simple User List. To display this list in the Send
screen, choose the Simple User List option in the Preferences dialog box
(Preferences is under the Mail menu).

Method 2
--------

Click the Address icon in the Send screen and select users in the Address Mail
window. To display this icon in the Send screen, choose the Address Window
option in the Preferences dialog box. All or part of the name can be typed to
reduce the list of names displayed. Selecting different Addressing Icons will
also reduce or increase the available addressing choices.

Method 3
--------

Create a form with a fixed list of recipients, users, and/or groups. In this
case, the mail message is sent to these preselected mail recipients. For more
information on how to create this type of form, query on the following
keywords:

   " form and permanent " (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: When you are using the Forms Designer to create a custom form, a separate
field cannot be created to allow a user to type a user and/or group name as a
mail recipient. The User List, Address Window, or predefined list must be used
for addressing.
