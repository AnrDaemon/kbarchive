-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, MS-DOS workstation, versions 1.37, 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The IRMA board is not supported by Microsoft Mail (PC Client). Microsoft did not
test the Mail PC Client with the IRMA board, IBM PC 3270, or any other computer
that uses a 3270 emulation board.

Microsoft does not guarantee the Mail PC Client's performance under this type of
operating environment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IRMA board, along with its driver software, provides an interface between a
PC and an IBM 3270 mainframe computer. Through "windows," the PC can run
3270-based applications (such as a 3270 workstation) and a PC-based application
at the same time. A "hotkey" sequence allows the user to switch between the two
different applications. The IBM PC 3270 is a PC/AT that has built-in 3270
workstation capabilities.

The Mail PC Client uses the Character Oriented Window (COW) interface, which can
experience severe compatibility problems with a PC that operates as a 3270
workstation.
