SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail, the Network Manager is the only recipient of an inquiry
message. It is an auto-addressed form. Therefore, the Network Manager is unable
to forward an inquiry message.

The Network Manager can create a custom inquiry form that gives the Network
Manager the option of forwarding the message to other users.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on how to create a custom form, see the "Using Custom Forms
in Microsoft Mail" appendix in the "Microsoft Mail Network Manager's Guide."
