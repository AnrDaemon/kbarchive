SUMMARY
=======

The Zenith 386/16, Zenith 286LP, and Zenith 25 running Zenith DOS 3.3-Plus will
hang at the end of the Flight Instruction lesson when the flight instructor
issues the final comments concerning the student's lesson that was just
completed. Updating to MS-DOS Version 3.31 or later eliminates this problem.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
