The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To print a field with its corresponding label when designing a form with the
Forms Designer in Microsoft Mail, the label's field name should include the name
of the field followed by the word "Label" (without the quotation marks).

For example, if there is a text field with the field name of "From", the field
should be called "From Label" so mail knows that the label and the text field
are associated on the printed form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Please note that there is a difference between the label and the label's field
name.

The label's field name is the name given to the label in the Field Info dialog
box.

The label is the text to be displayed next to a field in the final form.

The Field Info dialog box can be accessed by double-clicking a field or by
selecting a field and choosing Field Info from the Objects menu.
