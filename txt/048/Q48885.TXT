SUMMARY
=======

The newline character (\n) is equivalent to the ASCII linefeed character (hex
0A). Thus, for files opened in text mode, CR/LF pairs are read in as newline
characters, and newline characters are written as CR/LF.

This information applies to STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR, which are opened in text
mode by default.

When using strtok() to extract tokens separated by CR/LF in a file opened in text
mode, only \n must be used as a token delimiter.
