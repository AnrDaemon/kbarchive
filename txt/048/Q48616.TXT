TITLE   :Mac Wkst: Cannot Print to Local Printer When Using a NetModem
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to print messages from Microsoft Mail to a printer connected over
AppleTalk, the message may not print when Mail is accessed remotely through a
Shiva NetModem.

CAUSE
=====

This problem only occurs if the user and the printer are on the same side of the
modem, and the Mail server is on the other side of the modem.

AppleTalk can only use one serial port at a time. Because AppleTalk is currently
channeled through the modem port (via the NetModem), those devices connected
through the printer port (the normal AppleTalk channel) cannot be accessed.

The inability to channel AppleTalk through both serial ports is a limitation of
AppleTalk.

WORKAROUND
==========

To print the message, do the following:

1. Save the message on disk.

2. Disconnect from the remote server.

3. Restart your Macintosh.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using Microsoft Mail version 3.1 or later, you can move any messages
to a locally stored folder, disconnect from the server, and then print the
message while you are in an offline session.
