Pages 621-624: Alternate FTP Location Available
-----------------------------------------------

On pages 621-624, the exercises require you to work with files on an FTP site. If
you find that these files are not accessible at the premier1.net FTP location
sited in the book, you can use an alternate FTP location.

You can complete the exercises as outlined in the book using the files located
at:

ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/mspress/excel2000/

Note that this site contains only the three files used in the exercises and does
not contain the folders pub, users, or quacky that are available on the
premier1.net site.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
