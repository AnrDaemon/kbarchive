SUMMARY
=======

If named pipes is listed in the remote procedure call (RPC) binding order as the
primary protocol on a client computer, and you connect to a Microsoft Exchange
Server computer by using the Microsoft Exchange Client or Outlook, your logon
name is displayed in Server Manager as an open resource over named pipes on the
Exchange Server computer in one of the following formats:

 - "<USER>" \\pipe\\00000xxx.001

 - "<USER>" \\pipe\00000xxx.000

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) or RPC is listed
first in the binding order, neither TCP/IP nor RPC is displayed in Server
Manager as an open resource. Also, when you dump the endpoints to determine the
pipe name, the endpoints are displayed as "STORE" and "ADMIN" in the user
interface.

To view this information on the Exchange Server computer:

1. Start Server Manager in Administrative Tools.

2. Click the appropriate Exchange Server computer.

3. Click Computer, and then click Properties.

4. Click In Use.

Notice that the following is displayed as an open resource for the client user:

   \\pipe\00000xx.000
