======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In SNA Server, an Access Violation (AV) occurs after logging Event 3. If this
problem occurs, the SNA Server service terminates unexpectedly. The following
events may be logged in the application event log at the time of the failure:

   Event ID: 3
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: (1106) Node Configuration Error

   NOTE: Subcode X'1106' indicates that the configuration file (Com.cfg) is
   corrupted.

   Event ID: 624
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: Creating dump file [path]\snadump.log for snaserver.exe

If Drwtsn32.exe is configured as the default debugger on the SNA Server system,
the Drwtsn32.log will be updated with the Access Violation information for
Snaservr.exe.

In the reported instance of this problem, the SNA Server was also logging the
following event prior to the Access Violation:

   Event ID: 22
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: APPC session activation failure: BIND negotiated parameters
   unacceptable

CAUSE
=====

Under certain circumstances, the SNA Server service (node) can delete an
Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) mode record and its associated
mode data record from its internal configuration structures even when the mode
data record is still being used by another mode record. This causes the
configuration to become corrupt, which will lead to the problem described here.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 (all
Service Packs), 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, and 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.
