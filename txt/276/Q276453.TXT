SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft SNA Server versions 2.11 and later provide support for Dynamically
Defined Dependent Logical Units (DDDLUs) for 3270 display LUs. DDDLU support for
LUA LUs was first added in SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1). However, DDDLU
support for 3270 Printer LUs is not provided in SNA Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DDDLU support for 3270 Printer LUs is available after you apply the update to
SNA Server 4.0. By default, DDDLU support for 3270 Printer LUs is disabled. To
enable this support, the following registry entry must be set to specify the
model name that is sent to the host in an Network Management Vector Table (NMVT)
request, in order to solicit an Activate LU (ACTLU) or Deactivate LU (DACTLU)
for 3270 Printer LUs.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaServr\Parameters

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

   Value Name: PrinterDDDLUModel
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   Value: <Model Name>

4. Quit Registry Editor.

Model Name needs to be replaced with the model name of the printer LU that SNA
Server will send to the host in the NMVT request to activate/deactivate the
printer LU. These values are defined on the host. Typical values may be 3270SCS
for LU1 printers or 3270DSC for LU3 printers. The model name string can be up to
seven characters long. The SNA Server pads any strings that are less than seven
characters with spaces, or truncates any strings that are longer than seven
characters to ensure that only seven characters are sent to the host as part of
the NMVT requests.

NOTE: This support for DDDLUs is limited to either LU1 printer LUs or LU3 printer
LUs because the PrinterDDDLUModel registry entry is global in nature and applies
to all dynamically created 3270 printer LUs.
