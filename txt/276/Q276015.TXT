   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX 1.0, you can change the way that a case
is presented to an NFS client after mounting a file system by using menu
commands. When you use Windows Services for UNIX 2.0, you must modify the
registry to do this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows Services for UNIX 1.0 has the following commands in Advanced Server
Options:

 - NTFS Case - Upper, Lower, and Ignore

 - FAT Case - Upper, Lower, and Ignore

 - CDFS Case - Upper, Lower, and Ignore

Although these menu commands are not available in Windows Services for UNIX 2.0,
you can use these settings by modifying the registry.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To use these settings, locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NfsSvr\Parameters

You can use any of the following registry values:

   

   Value name: NtfsCase
   Value type: REG_DWORD
   Value data: 0 - ignore
            1 - lowercase
            2 - uppercase
            (default=0)

   Value name: FatCase
   Value type: REG_DWORD
   Value data: 0 - ignore
            1 - lowercase
            2 - uppercase
            (default=0)

   Value name: CdfsCase
   Value type: REG_DWORD
   Value data: 0 - ignore
            1 - lowercase
            2 - uppercase
            (default=0)

   Value Name:  CaseSensitive
   Value type:  REG_DWORD
   Value data:  1 - enable case sensitivity. (Default)
             0 - ignore case on mounts, directories and files

The following example describes the effect of these settings and assumes that
Windows 2000 is using an NFS server to share the Test.txt file:

 - If you set the case value to zero (0), the UNIX client can view the file, and
   it is title capitalized (Test.txt).

 - If you set the case values to one (1), the UNIX client can view the file, but
   the file name is in all lowercase letters (test.txt).

 - If you set the case value to two (2), the client can view the file, but the
   file name is in all uppercase letters (TEST.TXT).

The CaseSensitive value controls whether mounts, directories and file names are
case sensitive. If a UNIX computer or other NFS client attempts to copy files to
a directory named "Xxxxx" but uses an incorrect case, a "Not a directory" error
message is returned. Changing this value to 0 enables the NFS client to copy
files to that directory. This also prevents generation of more than one file
with the same name, but with a different case. For example, XyZZy is not the
same file as xyzzy when CaseSensitive is enabled. When you set CaseSensitive to
0, they would address the same file.
