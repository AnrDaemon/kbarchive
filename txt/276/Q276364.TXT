======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft SNA Server operator has an active connection to an AS/400 and
then attempts to verify LU 6.2 session availability for a given Advanced
Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) triplet (for example local LU, remote
LU, and mode name) by using the APPC Session Viewer utility, and the test fails,
look for the following event in the Microsoft Windows NT Application Event log:

   event id 18

   APPC session activation failure: BIND negative response or UNBIND request
   received

   Sense data = 80040000 (NOTE: 0032xxxx indicates UNBIND received)
   Connection = connection
   LU alias = lu alias
   PLU alias = plu alias
   Mode name = mode name

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server sent a BIND request to start an LU version 6.2 session with the
remote system, but the remote system rejected the request for the reason
indicated in the sense data error. This error is usually caused by a mismatch
between the SNA Server configuration and the configuration of the remote system
(for example, the Local APPC LU name, Remote APPC LU name or mode name specified
in the SNA BIND request may not be configured on the host).

RESOLUTION
==========

Make certain that the "Remote APPC LU" name that is created on the SNA server
matches the "Local Control Point Name" on the AS/400.
