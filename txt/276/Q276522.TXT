SYMPTOMS
========

If a Line Printer Remote (LPR) printer is offline (because it is out of paper)
for about two hours, the print job that was being spooled to the printer when it
went offline becomes corrupted.

CAUSE
=====

If the printer remains offline for about two hours, the LPR server daemon times
out the session to the printer. This causes the last print job that was being
spooled to the printer to be truncated.
