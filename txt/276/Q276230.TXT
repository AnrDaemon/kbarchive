======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server's host print service may cause spaces to be printed in the wrong
order if the host print job contains data in the following sequence:

   

   0C400D<printable data>

   Where:
   X'0C' - Form Feed
   X'40' - Space
   X'0D' - Carriage Return
   <printable data> - Any valid printable data

Instead of printing the data in the correct order, the carriage return is
executed first, and then the space codes. As a result, the top line is formatted
incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
