The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you set a large time-out value (for example, 15 minutes) and configure "Job
termination on unbind," you may experience intermittent timing problems when you
print, and print sessions may stop responding (appear to be "hung") or be
unresponsive.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a timing issue between when one print job actually
times out and the next print job begins. For example, you do some printing on a
session, and then end the bracket. Because of the job termination option, this
action does not close down the printer. About 15 minutes later (or whatever
value is configured), a new print job comes down (an FMI BID is sent).
PrintServer replies with a BID ACK, but because the printer is already open, it
does not actually reset the timer (this is the bug). Unfortunately, the timer
pops before the next data message arrives, and the session is hung.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
