======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you disable the traveling mode option on a client computer, you may notice
that the mobile client computer has been assigned to all of the sites that it
has visited.

CAUSE
=====

When you enable the traveling mode option on a mobile client, the Smsasign.ini
file (located at <Windir>\Ms\Sms\Core\Data\) is modified to indicate
"CLIENT_ASSIGNED." This setting prevents the mobile client from being added
automatically to sites that it visits. However, if you disable the traveling
mode option, the Systems Management Server (SMS)-based client is automatically
assigned to that site.

WORKAROUND
==========

When the traveling mode option is enabled, do not turn it off. This workaround
may be easier to implement if you use the Clitrvl.exe tool that is included with
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
