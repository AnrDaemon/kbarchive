TITLE   :XCLN: Unread Messages Are Not Displayed in Other Mailboxes

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

If you set up an Outlook profile that you can use to open another mailbox as
well as your own personal mailbox, the number of unread messages listed in the
Inbox may not equal the total number of unread messages that are displayed in
the folder. For example, the Inbox (or any other folders) of the other mailbox
may report that you have 10 unread messages, but only five unread messages are
displayed in that folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs if the messages that are sent to the other mailbox are set
to Private instead of the default setting, which is Normal. This behavior is by
design.

If you create a profile that logs on to that other mailbox directly, the correct
number of messages is displayed.
