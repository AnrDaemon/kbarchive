TITLE   :Adsiis.dll Leaks Memory Because of Unreleased String Allocation
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you get the properties of a user object in a script by using Active
Directory Services Interface (ADSI), some memory may be leaked for each
iteration of the script.

CAUSE
=====

The getproperty method in the CPropertyCache class does not release an allocated
BSTR data-type string. Therefore, 20 bytes are leaked each time the function is
called.

RESOLUTION
==========

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
