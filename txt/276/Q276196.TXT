SUMMARY
=======

Network Management Vector Table (NMVT) Power Off messages for Self-Defining
Dependent Logical Units (SDDLUs) are now supported with SNA Server 4.0. This
feature allows SNA Server to send this message to the host when a Close System
Services Control Point (SSCP) is received from the client. This in turn allows
the host to free the LUs from System Services Control Point (VTAM) control
blocks.
