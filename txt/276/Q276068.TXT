======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server service may experience an Access Violation (AV) in the S1PCSGO
function while trying to send an unsolicited status update to SNA Server Manager
to report a session deactivated event. If Drwtsn32.exe is configured as the
default debugger on the SNA Server system, the Drwtsn32.log file will be updated
with information similar to the following:

   Application exception occurred:
   App: [path]snaservr.exe (pid=[process ID #])
   When: [date] @ [time]
   Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

   [...]

   function: s1pcsgo

CAUSE
=====

There is a small timing window where the SNA Server service may try to send a
status update for a resource after the resource has been deleted from the SNA
Server configuration. When this occurs, the SNA Server service ends up
referencing a null internal record that causes the specified Access Violation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 (all
SP), 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, and 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SNA Server service has been updated to verify that a resource is valid
before it reports status for the resource. This update will prevent this type of
Access Violation from occurring in the future.
