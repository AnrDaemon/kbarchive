======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use code page 870 as your host code page with the 5250 Applet,
incorrect characters are sent and received to/from the host.

CAUSE
=====

The 5250 Applet that is delivered with SNA Server uses OEM code page 852 to
convert American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) to Extended
Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) characters or vice versa, rather
than using code page 1250.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0
(all Service Packs).

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you encounter this problem, you may see the correct characters displayed in
the 5250 Applet when you are typing.

Before these data are transferred to the AS/400, ASCII to EBCDIC conversion is
performed. Because the 5250 Applet is a Microsoft Windows application, code page
1250, Windows Latin 2 (Central Europe) must be converted to EBCDIC code page
870, instead of code page 852, MS-DOS Latin 2 to EBCDIC code page 870.

Therefore, the data arriving at the AS/400 are mapped to incorrect EBCDIC
characters. This problem affects both Polish and Czech customers.
