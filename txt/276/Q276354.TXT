PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbCOMIS kbWin2000sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Applications such as Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions may deadlock because
Web Application Manager (WAM) is waiting for the metabase.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because a first chance access violation (AV) occurs in the
metadata handling code that causes a critical section to be orphaned, resulting
in a deadlock on another thread.
