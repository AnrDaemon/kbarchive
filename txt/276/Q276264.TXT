======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a file through SNA Server, zero-byte-size files may be
printed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem only occurs when ByPass GDI is selected in the printer session
configuration dialog box. Typically, the SNA Server Print Service starts up a
print job by calling the StartDoc function. However, when ByPass GDI is
selected, this print job must be started up transparently, so the AbortDoc
function is called, then the StartDocPrinter function is called.

Because of a timing issue with Microsoft Windows NT, the handle to the original
file is not released immediately, which can cause the call to StartDocPrinter to
fail, which results in the zero byte file. This problem has been corrected so
that print jobs are started transparently, by using a generated minimal PDT
file, rather than SNA Print Service having to stop and restart them. This same
approach is used in Microsoft Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000.
