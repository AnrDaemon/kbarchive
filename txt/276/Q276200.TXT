TITLE   :BUG: ADO Application May Hang When Using OLE DB Provider for DB2
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::4.0 SP2,4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbsna400sp2 kbsna400sp3 kbSNA400sp4fix kbSNA400PreSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An Active Data Object (ADO) application that leverages the OLE DB Provider for
DB2 may intermittently stop responding (hang) when the data source is configured
to use the Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) transport to the
remote system.

The following Visual Basic sample code shows a typical code-loop scenario in
which this problem may occur:

    ...
    ...
      If (rsChrgs.State And adStateOpen) = adStateOpen Then

           While Not bDone
           
               vaRows = rsChrgs.GetRows(100)  
               nTotalRows = UBound(vaRows, 2)
               For nRow = 0 To nTotalRows
                   DoEvents
                   If bCancel Then Exit Function
               Next
               bDone = (nTotalRows < 99)
           Wend
       
       End If
    ...
    ...

A call to the GetRows function may block indefinitely so that control is not
returned to the calling function. The application hangs at this point.

CAUSE
=====

When the OLE DB Provider for DB2 receives a Distributed Data Management (DDM)
General Data Stream (GDS) header that is split across multiple TCP/IP packets,
the provider does not work correctly (fails). No errors are reported to the
Microsoft Windows NT Application Event Log when the provider fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.
