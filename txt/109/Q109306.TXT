The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS, version 2.5b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In FoxPro for Windows, when the PLAIN parameter is used in conjunction with the
REPORT FORM command, it does not function as documented on page L3-822 in the
"Language Reference":

   If PLAIN is included, a page heading appears only at the beginning of the
   report.

The documentation is incorrect. When the PLAIN parameter is issued in conjunction
with the REPORT FORM command, it produces a report that does not have any page
headers.
