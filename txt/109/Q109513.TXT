SUMMARY
=======

If you use Microsoft MS-DOS Shell to copy multiple files to a floppy disk, a
zero-byte file may be created if the floppy disk becomes full before all
selected files are copied. No files are lost, however, because the file that was
not copied remains on the source disk.

Additional query words: 0 0-byte 5.00 5.00a 6.00 zero dos shell dosshell doshell
