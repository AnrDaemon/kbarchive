TITLE   :Spool File Location is Not Configurable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from an application under Windows NT, the Spooler usually stores
the print job as a pair of files on your hard disk. The location of these files
is not configurable, the Spooler is hard-coded to store the files at
%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\SPOOL\PRINTERS.

CAUSE
=====

This is a limitation in the current product.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation or Server version
3.5.

There is no workaround to force the Spooler to store spool files in a different
location, but you can prevent spooling from applications running on the local
computer. In Print Manager, select the printer whose jobs should not be spooled.
From the Printer menu, choose Properties, and then select the Details button. In
the Printer Details dialog box, select the Print Directly To Ports option. Note
that the Print Directly To Ports option is not available for printers that are
shared on the network.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in Windows NT
Workstation or Server version 3.5.
