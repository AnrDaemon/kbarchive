The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is not possible to print from the Control Room (adult mode). When you choose
Printing Options from the File menu and then choose the Print button, the
program does not really print. This procedure just sets your printing options.
To print, return to Creative Writer or Fine Artist and click on the Toaster.

This functionality is by design. You cannot print from the Control Room in the
Windows version of Creative Writer and Fine Artist, either.
