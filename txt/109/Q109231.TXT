SUMMARY
=======

Many Macintosh keyboards do not have function keys F1 through F12. However, you
can still begin and stop recording macros on these systems.

1. To begin recording a macro, choose Macros from the Program menu. If you are
   using Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, click Macros from the Tools menu. Click
   the Record button. After you define a key combination for the macro and click
   OK, the following message will appear:

   Recording <keystroke combo>. SHIFT + F10 to stop

2. Record the macro.

3. To stop recording the macro, press COMMAND+OPTION+SHIFT+0 instead of
   SHIFT+F10.

If a macro is not currently being recorded, pressing COMMAND+OPTION+SHIFT+0 opens
the Macro Key Definition dialog box so that you can start recording a new macro.

FoxPro for Macintosh "User's Guide."
