PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.4 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision Host
Access, if two Free/Busy distributions from the same postoffice are in the
Calendar Service Machine (MS-CSM) reader, the second distribution is usually
rejected back to the LAN. The following error message is displayed:

   OUT of Sequence Error

CAUSE
=====

If Free/Busy updates are scheduled on the LAN in 15 minute intervals and there
is heavy traffic, then two distributions may be queued for the host on any given
upload. This may also happen if the gateway is halted for ANY reason. When the
MS-CSM machine sends the distributions to the MS-CAL machine, MS-CAL cannot
return confirmation of the first distribution before processing the second. The
following error message is displayed:

   OUT of Sequence Error

and all LAN data is refreshed.

RESOLUTION
==========

The resolutions are as follows:

1. Schedule LAN distributions at intervals of 30 minutes or more.

2. Direct the customer to a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Gateway Support
   Professional.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM
PROFS and OfficeVision Host Access version 3.4.
