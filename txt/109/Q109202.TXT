SUMMARY
=======

According to Calcomp, the Calcomp 907 plotter driver version 3.00 for Microsoft
Windows 3.1 has configuration problems and limitations that may affect the
desired output on Calcomp plotters that support the 907 command language.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problems concern the plot scaling and transmutation retry features of the
Calcomp 907 driver and the Calcomp 907 plotters themselves and are listed
below.

 - Plot Scaling. The resolution setting of the plotter must be set to 2032 dots
   per inch (dpi) to allow plotter scaling features to be enabled. Any other
   resolution cannot scale with the Calcomp driver.

 - Transmission Retry. The Calcomp 907 plotter driver configuration allows
   changes to the transmutation retry value, but the value entered has no effect
   on the transmission retry. Calcomp suggests changing the transmission retry
   value by using Microsoft Windows Control Panel.

The following are limitations of the version 3.00 Calcomp 907 plotter driver:

 - Maximum paper size is 128 inches wide by 128 inches long. (This includes
   continuous roll paper.)

 - Maximum number of copies is 99.

The products included here are manufactured by Calcomp, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
