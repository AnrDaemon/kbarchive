SYMPTOMS
========

Using the generic Microsoft 800 x 600 256-color Super VGA driver with the ATI
VGA Wondercard (or a comparable card) with only 512 kilobytes video memory
creates a repeating window at the bottom of the screen.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use a 16-color video driver or the 256-color driver
that comes with the video card. The Microsoft 800 x 600 256-color Super VGA
video driver requires 1 megabyte of RAM on the video card to properly display
the 800 x 600 resolution with 256 colors.
