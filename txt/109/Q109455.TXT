-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply a background to your document, you may find that it alters the
layout of your text columns. For example, if you apply the T-Shirt background to
a three-column document, you may find that only one of the original three
columns still appears. This problem only occurs with some of the background
styles, and the symptoms may differ depending on how many text columns you are
using and which background style you selected.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In Creative Writer, choose the Page Stuff tool from the toolbar.

2. Choose the Column Maker, select three-column formatting, and click on the
   document.

3. Type text to fill two or three columns.

4. Choose Background, select the T-Shirt background, and click on the document.

The multiple column text will appear in a single column down the center of the
page, and will continue on ensuing pages.
