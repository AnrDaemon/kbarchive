Page 633 of the Windows NT Resource Guide (volume 1 of the Microsoft
Windows NT Resource Kit) states:

   "When two computers establish a session via NBF, there is an exchange of
   Least Significant Numbers (LSN)."

This is incorrect.

LSN stands for Local Session Number. This is a one byte number (0-255),
which is part of Network Control Block structure. It indicates the session
number the user[redirector] has with another name on the network, and is a
key variable in the 254-session limit of the NetBIOS architecture.
