SUMMARY
=======

After you have exported information from a FoxPro for Macintosh database, there
may be linefeeds in the file. To remove these linefeeds, use the FxStripLF()
function found in FOXTOOLS.MLB.

For example, the following code will remove the linefeeds from a dummy file
called TEST.TXT located on the desktop:

      SET LIBRARY TO FOXTOOLS
      * Use the following line with Visual FoxPro for Macintosh
      * SET LIBRARY TO FOXTOOLS.CFM
      =FxStripLF( "Macintosh HD:Desktop Folder:Test.Txt" )
