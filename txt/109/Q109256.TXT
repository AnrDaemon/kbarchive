The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

During installation of version 3.2 of the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and
AppleTalk Networks, the Mail for PC Networks administrator is asked to define
the proxy network and postoffice names that will be used to represent the Mail
for AppleTalk Networks system. If the administrator accepts the default values
during installation, the proxy network and postoffice names will be
MACNET/MACPO.

Below are instructions for changing the proxy network and postoffice names from
the default values.

NOTE: DO NOT change the proxy network and postoffice names by editing the
MACGATE.INI file.


To change the proxy network/postoffice name on the gateway postoffice
---------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: Changing your proxy network or postoffice name invalidates all Mail for
AppleTalk Networks addresses that have been added to global groups, Mail for PC
Networks users' Personal Address Books (PABs), personal groups, and Remote
client address lists.

1. Remove all Mail for AppleTalk Networks addresses from Mail for PC Networks by
   choosing Remove Mac Names From PC from the Connection Name Utility's
   (CNU[ASCII 146]s) File menu. The Mail for AppleTalk Networks addresses are
   automatically removed from all Mail for PC Networks postoffices that
   participate in Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) after the next Dir-Sync
   cycle. Do not continue until the Mail for AppleTalk Networks addresses have
   been removed from Mail for PC Networks.

2. Disable the Mail for PC Networks side of the gateway (terminate the
   MACGATE.EXE program).

3. Run the Mail Connection 3.2 PC Setup program and select Modify MS Mail
   Connection On A Gateway/Downstream Postoffice. Enter the path to your
   MAILDATA and MAILEXE directories and change the proxy network and postoffice
   names.

   NOTE: You must enter a unique network name for the proxy network.

4. Remove the old proxy network/postoffice requestor record from the Dir- Sync
   server postoffice and add the new proxy network and postoffice as a Dir-Sync
   requestor:

   a. Run the Mail for PC Networks Administrator utility on the Dir-Sync server
      postoffice.

   b. Select Config, Dir-Sync, Server, Requestor, Delete to delete the old
      requestor record.

   c. Select Config Dir-Sync, Server, Requestor, Create to define the new proxy
      network and postoffice as a Dir-Sync requestor.

   NOTE: Make sure you enter the same password that was used for the old proxy
   network/postoffice requestor record.

5. Log in to the Mail for AppleTalk Networks gateway server as the Network
   Manager. From the Mail menu, choose Gateway, then Configuration. Confirm that
   the new proxy network and postoffice names appear on the Mail connection
   gateway configuration screen and click the Update button to continue.

   NOTE: You MUST click the Update button to update the internal Mail for
   AppleTalk Networks gateway configuration record after changing your proxy
   network or postoffice name.

   Export the complete Mail for AppleTalk Networks directory to the Mail for PC
   Networks Dir-Sync server postoffice by means of the CNU. From the CNU File
   menu, choose Export Directory, then click the Complete Directory button.

6. Start the PC side of the gateway by executing the MACGATE.EXE program.

7. The Mail for AppleTalk Networks addresses should reappear in the Global
   Address List (GAL) and under the new proxy network/postoffice list after the
   next Dir-Sync cycle is completed.

   NOTE: The Dir-Sync server postoffice reports this error message during the
   first Dir-Sync cycle after the proxy network or postoffice name change. You
   can disregard it.

   Error [138] Server sync does not exist anymore (22)

To change the proxy network/postoffice name on downstream postoffices
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Disable any Mail for PC Networks Externals or gateways that process mail on
   the downstream postoffice.

2. Run the Mail Connection 3.2 PC Setup program and Select Modify MS Mail
   Connection On A Gateway/Downstream Postoffice. The Setup program prompts you
   to enter the path to your MAILDATA directory, your current (old) proxy
   network and postoffice names, and the network and postoffice name of the
   gateway postoffice. Then enter your new proxy network and/or postoffice
   names.

   NOTE: The proxy network and postoffice names on the downstream postoffice must
   match the proxy network and postoffice names on the gateway postoffice.

3. Restart any Mail for PC Networks Externals or gateways you disabled in step
   1.

4. Request a complete directory import with Dir-Sync by running the Mail for PC
   Networks Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) and selecting Config, Dir-Sync,
   Requestor, Import.

5. The Mail for AppleTalk Networks addresses should reappear in the GAL and
   under the new proxy network/postoffice list after the next Dir-Sync cycle is
   completed.

To update Remote client address lists
-------------------------------------

WARNING: Changing the proxy network or postoffice name invalidates all Mail for
AppleTalk Networks addresses for Remote client users.

Regenerate the default directory view for Remote client users by running the Mail
for PC Networks Administrator program and selecting Remote, Regenerate.

The Remote client users should download the new directory during their next
on-line session.
