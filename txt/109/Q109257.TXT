 - Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks
temporarily suspends gateway message delivery while the Connection Name Utility
(CNU) performs directory import or export tasks. Normal message delivery resumes
after the CNU completes its directory exchange tasks.

The CNU scans the Network Manager[ASCII 146]s mailbox for directory exchange
messages and processes them. It does this upon initial startup of the CNU, and
at the directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) T3 time defined in the CNU
configuration screen.

Large directory import or export requests may take the CNU several hours to
process. These directory exchange tasks should be performed at off-peak hours to
minimize the delayed delivery of gateway messages.
