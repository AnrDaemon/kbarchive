files.

To work around this problem, do one the following:

 - Back up the registry files interactively by selecting the Backup Local
   Registry option in the Administrative Tools Backup program.

-or-

 - Use the Windows NT Resource Kit utility REGBACK from the command line or in
   batch files.

STATUS

Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
