TITLE   :Cannot Read Last Image from Photo-CD
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.21,6.22; WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msdos

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may be unable to read the last image from a Photo-CD under MS-DOS version
6.2 and 6.21 using Kodak Access, Tempra Access, or other third- party Photo-CD
software.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you are using SMARTDrive version 5.0 (included with
MS-DOS 6.2 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11) to cache the Photo-CD.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either disable disk caching on the CD-ROM drive, or
add the "/E:2048" (without the quotation marks) parameter to the SMARTDRV.EXE
command (typically in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file). For example:

   smartdrv /e:2048

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMARTDrive attempts to read more data than is initially requested. This is
called "read ahead" caching. When SMARTDrive reads past the end of a Photo- CD
it fails to read the last photo. This problem occurs because a Photo-CD does not
contain data after the last photo, even though the CD disk size indicates
additional sectors exist.

The /E parameter specifies in bytes the amount of the cache that SMARTDrive moves
at a time. Reducing the element size to 2048 (from the default of 8192) prevents
SMARTDrive from attempting to read past the end of the Photo- CD.

For more information on configuring SMARTDrive, type "help smartdrv" (without the
quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

MS-DOS version 6.22 ships with SMARTDrive version 5.01. SMARTDrive version 5.01
fixes problems with Kodak Photo-CDs. For more information about SMARTDrive, see
