TITLE   :BUG: In-line Comment in Continued FORMAT Causes Syntax Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbFL32 kbFortranPSkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, versions 1.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to compile a program containing a FORMAT specifier that is more than
one line long and that has an in-line comment on a line other than the last,
causes the following warning:

   warning F4989: ' ' : unexpected character in format

In-line comments start with an exclamation point. If the FORMAT statement is
referenced during program execution, it will cause the program to terminate with
exit code 1. The following run-time error might be generated:

   run-time error F6989: WRITE
   ' %c ' : unexpected character in format

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem can be corrected by removing the embedded comment.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Sample Code
