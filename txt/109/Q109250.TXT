PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After running GRAFTABL.COM from the MS-DOS 6.2 Supplemental Disk, you receive
the following error message:

   Incorrect DOS version

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the MS-DOS 6.2 Supplemental Disk removed
"GRAFTABL.COM 5.00" from the MS-DOS 6.2 SETVER table and failed to add
"GRAFTABL.COM 6.00."

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, add GRAFTABL.COM back to the SETVER table. For
example, type "setver graftabl.com 6.00" (without the quotation marks) at the
MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

Additional query words: 6.20
