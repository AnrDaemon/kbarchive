TITLE   :PROFS: Location Field in Meeting Request Dropped
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The LOCATION field in PROFS/OfficeVision meeting request is lost when a PROFS/OV
user invites a version 1.0 of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows user to a meeting.

CAUSE
=====

Schedule+ does not have an equivalent LOCATION field so the LOCATION information
is placed into the body of the meeting request. This is by design. When the
Schedule+ accepts the meeting, only the subject field is added to the entry in
the Schedule+ calendar.

RESOLUTION
==========

The location information must be manually copied (using copy/paste) into the
Schedule+ appointment.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.4 of Microsoft Mail
Gateway to PROFS. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
