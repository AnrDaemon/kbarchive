-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the INKEY() function is issued in a full-screen application (the Apple
Finder does not appear in the background), there is no way to return to the
Finder or to switch applications until a key is pressed. The machine appears to
be hung.

RESOLUTION
==========

If any part of the Finder or another application is visible in the background,
you can click on this area to activate it. Otherwise, you must press a key
before any other action can occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Type the following commands in the Command window:


      ZOOM WINDOW SCREEN MAX
      =INKEY(0)


Note that mouse clicks are no longer recognized and the application menu is not
available, preventing you from switching to another application.
