TITLE   :UNDELETE Err Msg: Cannot Load with Neither Option Selected

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Undelete for MS-DOS (UNDELETE.EXE) generates the following error
message when the command UNDELETE /LOAD is run:

   Cannot load with neither option selected

CAUSE
=====

This error is the result of an improper combination of settings found in the
[defaults] section of the UNDELETE.INI file. This error occurs if the [defaults]
section of the UNDELETE.INI file appears as follows:

   [defaults]
   d.sentry=FALSE
   d.tracker=FALSE

The UNDELETE /LOAD command relies on this section to load whichever option is set
to TRUE. If both values are FALSE, UNDELETE does not load.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Use the command UNDELETE /T to specifically load Delete Tracker, or use
   UNDELETE /S to specifically load Delete Sentry.

-or-

 - Edit the UNDELETE.INI file to set the chosen method of delete protection to
   TRUE. For example, to make the command UNDELETE /LOAD load Delete Sentry by
   default, set the [defaults] section of the UNDELETE.INI file as follows:

   [defaults]
   d.sentry=TRUE
   d.tracker=FALSE

For more information about the UNDELETE.INI file, type "help undelete" (without
the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt, press ENTER, and refer to the
Notes section.
