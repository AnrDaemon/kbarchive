 - Microsoft Isaac Asimov's The Ultimate Robot for the Macintosh, version 1.0

SYMPTOMS
========

There are several video and audio errors in Asimov's Ultimate Robot. They
include the following:

 - A tear in the video for Computer Animated Robots, "Fair Play."

 - Poor color and tracking in the video for Industrial Robots, "Peter Cahoon's
   Virtual Hopper."

 - Poor capture in the video for Industrial Robots, "Toilet Bowl Cleaner."

The sound in these selections also contains some playback problems.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Asimov's Ultimate Robot version
1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
