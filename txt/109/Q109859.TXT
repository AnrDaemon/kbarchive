SUMMARY
=======

Some runway approaches in Flight Simulator 5.0 are "Localizer Only", meaning
there is no glide slope available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, approaches to the real Chicago O'Hare runway 4L are Localizer Only.
When you are approaching Chicago O'Hare runway 4L in Flight Simulator with your
NAV1 radio tuned to the runway frequency of 111.3, you will not see activity on
the OBI1 glide slope needle and the EFIS display will not show a glide slope.
