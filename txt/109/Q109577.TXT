The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Creative Writer, the Drop Caps and/or Pop Caps features may not appear to
work properly. When you choose to apply Drop Caps or Pop Caps to a line of text,
the text may move to the right or wrap to the next line without the first
character being visibly affected. This happens because the special formatting is
applied to the first character in the line, regardless of what the character is.
If the first character is a tab or a space, the formatting is applied to it,
which results in the tab or space being enlarged. This can cause the text to
move to the right or to wrap to the next line.

RESOLUTION
==========

To apply Drop Caps or Pop Caps, you must remove all blank spaces and tabs from
the beginning of the line. Use the following steps to remove them and apply the
special caps:

1. Click the mouse to the left of the first visible character on the line and
   drag to the left. Any highlighting that appears indicates that a space or a
   tab is present.

2. Press the "DEL" (without the quotation marks) or "BACKSPACE" (without the
   quotation marks) key to remove the highlighted characters.

3. Click the Word tool (the uppercase "A" in the upper-left corner of the
   screen).

4. Click the Bank Switcher (the red lever next to McZee's Carpet Bag) until you
   see an icon with an uppercase "B" in its upper-left corner.

5. Click the icon with the uppercase "B" (Paragraph styles).

6. Select either Drop Caps or Pop Caps.

7. The mouse pointer should now look like a paintbrush. Click anywhere on the
   line where you want the special caps to be used.

The Drop Cap or Pop Cap should now appear.
