TITLE   :PROFS: Err Msg: Data Exception - LISTFILE: re-ipl
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.4 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision Host
Access, the Calendar Manager (xxxCAL) disks are accessed all at once and then
the gateway does a ListFile for each file. A Data Exception error may occur
between the Access and subsequent ListFile if one of the mini- disks is updated
before the ListFile.

The following Error Message will be displayed:

   DMSITP143T Data exception occurred at 00E29F8 in system LISTFILE: re-ipl
   CMS HCPMSG057I MSCSM not receiving; MSG off
   HCPGIR450W CP entered; disabled wait PSW 000A0000 80E3131C

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs in cases where the production calendar is highly used; thus,
preventing the MS-CSM machine from correctly accessing the PROFS/OV user's
schedule data.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail
for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
