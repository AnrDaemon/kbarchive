SUMMARY
=======

When you are using the FB+Migration application on a FoxBASE+ for the Macintosh
program, the Analyzer flags an @ ... SAY command as being incorrect when it
actually is correct.

CAUSE
=====

The error message occurs because the FONT clause has been added to the end of
the @ ... SAY command.

RESOLUTION

If you choose the Replace button, no changes will be made to the program. The
line of code will still function properly.
