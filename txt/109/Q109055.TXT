-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows for Workgroups 3.11, if you try to install the Microsoft Data Link
Control (MS-DLC) protocol for Windows for Workgroups by using the SETUP.EXE
program provided on the installation disk, you receive the following error
message:

   The network setup process could not be started.

   Setup Error 908: The version of the NETWORK.INF file that is currently on your
   system is incompatible with Setup and Control Panel. Expand and copy the
   NETWORK.INF file into the Windows SYSTEM directory.

CAUSE
=====

When you run MS-DLC SETUP.EXE, it first copies over the WFWSETUP.DLL and
WFWSETUP.CPL files. This replaces the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 WFWSETUP.DLL
file with an older version and causes a file that is no longer used to be added.
Next, the MS-DLC Setup program attempts to run the Windows for Workgroups 3.11
network setup routine. MS-DLC Setup uses the correct routine for Windows for
Workgroups 3.1, but this routine doesn't work with version 3.11.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not modify the NETWORK.INF file (there is nothing wrong with it). To correct
this problem, first delete the WFWSETUP.DLL file from the Windows SYSTEM
directory, then expand the correct version from the Windows for Workgroups 3.11
Disk 2 (for both the 3.5-inch and 5.25-inch disk sets). To expand the file, use
the following syntax

        expand <a>:\wfwsetup.dl_ <c>:<\windows\system>\wfwsetup.dll

where <a> is your floppy disk drive containing Disk 2, <c> is your
drive containing Windows, and <\windows\system> is the path for your
Windows SYSTEM directory. Also, delete the WFWSETUP.CPL file from your computer.
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 does not use this file. Restart Windows and add the
MS-DLC protocol as an unlisted or updated protocol by choosing the Network Setup
icon, which is located in the Network program group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For information on installing an unlisted or updated protocol in Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 see the "User's Guide." For additional information on setting up
and configuring Microsoft DLC, see the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Resource Kit
or the MS-DLC documentation.
