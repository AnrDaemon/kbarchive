The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks
includes the undocumented switch -MD to disable its Mailer component. The Mailer
component distributes incoming messages on a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
postoffice.

NOTE: This option can be used only if another process that also contains the
Mailer code is not disabled and is running against the same Microsoft Mail
postoffice. This other process can be the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE)
or any other gateway.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mailer is the Mail Connection gateway component that distributes a piece of mail
to a user's mailbag or to the outgoing queue of an externally defined
postoffice. The Mailer contains code that is shared among all gateways and the
External Mail program executable files. If this component were not shared, all
gateways would require the External Mail program to be running against the same
postoffice as well.
