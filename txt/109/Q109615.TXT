The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP receives messages from the SMTP world
for delivery to Microsoft Mail users. Some incoming messages may specify a
field in the RFC 822 headers called "Return Receipt To". This field is NOT
a part of the standard (RFC 822), and is an innovation of some versions of
the Sendmail program.

Although this field is not part of the RFC, it is supported by the SMTP
gateway.

The Sendmail program is the mailer program commonly used on UNIX TCP/IP
hosts. Other mailer programs include PMDF, and MMDF. Some mailer programs
use "Rr" instead of the field name "Return Receipt To" to perform the
same function.

Additional query words: 2.10 3.00
