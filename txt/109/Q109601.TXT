TITLE   :FoxPro for Macintosh Allows Trailing Spaces in Filenames
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Macintosh environment, FoxPro allows trailing spaces in filenames. This
behavior differs from that of FoxPro for Windows or FoxPro for MS-DOS, which
automatically trim the trailing spaces.

Trailing spaces in filenames could potentially cause problems in FoxPro for
Macintosh and other environments that allow long filenames.

Therefore, with the onset of more operating systems that allow long filenames and
spaces in filenames, good programming practice would warrant trimming all
filenames before actually creating the files.

================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Type the following commands in the Command window:

         m.fileh = FCREATE("test ") && Note the trailing space
         =FPUTS( m.fileh, "This is a test")
         =FCLOSE( m.file )

2. Issue the ADIR() function. Note that the return string for this file contains
   a trailing space (that is, "Test ").

NOTE: If this filename was stored in a 10-character database field, there would
be no way of determining exactly how many spaces were after the filename.
