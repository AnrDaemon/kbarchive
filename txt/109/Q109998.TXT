TITLE   :FIX: Divide by Zero Run-Time Error Not Produced
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain conditions, the Microsoft FORTRAN compiler will execute a program
without reporting any error, when in fact a divide-by-zero error has occurred.

CAUSE
=====

The run-time library is not being brought into the executable, so no run- time
error will occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation 32 for
Windows NT and MS-DOS, version 1.0. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN
PowerStation maintenance release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 for MS-DOS can be differentiated from the
maintenance release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more"
(without the quotation marks) from \F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for
FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 for MS-DOS, and it will show version 1.0f for
the maintenance release version 1.0a. This problem is rare because almost every
program written uses run-time functions. To make the program give the proper
run-time error, use any run-time routine such as WRITE to ensure the run-time
routines are part of the executable. The sample code below will exhibit the
run-time error. If the WRITE statement is removed, the code will complete
without an error.

Sample Code
-----------

   C compile options needed: none
   C

          a=1.
          b=0.
          c=a/b
          write (*,*) c
          end
