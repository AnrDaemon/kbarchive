TITLE   :BUG: Inline Comment with "!" Can Act Like a C String
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A program containing "!" (to denote an inline comment) directly following a
string constant interprets the "!" as the letter "C" and appends a null
character to the string.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation
32 version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

String values in the C language are terminated with null characters. This type
of string is specified in Microsoft FORTRAN by using a standard string constant
followed by the character C. The code sample below shows how unwanted null
characters are appended to string constants with "!" directly following.

Sample Code
-----------

           OPEN (1, FILE='TEST')
         WRITE(1, '(A)') 'Normal string'      ! This is a normal FORTRAN
   c     string
         WRITE(1, '(A)') 'Normal C string'C   ! The C following the string
   c     constants indicates a C string
         WRITE(1, '(A)')  'Extra null char'!  ! The "!" treats this
   c     string as a C string
         CLOSE (1)
         END
