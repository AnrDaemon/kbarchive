TITLE   :CONN: MACGATE.EXE Does Not Accept -BR Command-Line Option
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.2 of the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks,
the MACGATE.EXE program reports the following error if you include the Break
Relative (-BR) option on the command line:

   Run time parameter in MACGATE.INI file must be between 0 and 999. (307)

CAUSE
=====

The -BR command-line option does not override the RunTime parameter in the
MACGATE.INI file.

RESOLUTION
==========

The MACGATE.EXE program -BR option is implemented in version 3.2.1. The option
allows the administrator to allocate a termination time from within the MACGATE
command parameters. This no longer requires Dispatch to terminate the session or
requires the use of batch files when using MACGATE.EXE with Dispatch.

For more information on changing gateway configuration parameters, refer to pages
29 and 30 of the Mail Connection 3.2 "Administrator's Guide."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of the Microsoft
Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks. This problem was corrected in
version 3.2.1 of the Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks.

To obtain this updated file, please contact your Microsoft Technical Account
Manager (TAM) or Product Support Services (PSS).
