The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you install version 3.2 of the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and
AppleTalk Networks, you must choose the Update button on the Gateway
Configuration screen even if you do not want to change any of the default
configuration values.

Choosing the Update button on the Microsoft Mail Connection Gateway Configuration
screen causes the information in the MACGATE.INI file to be stored internally
within the Microsoft Mail Data file.

The Gateway Configuration screen must be updated during the initial installation
of the gateway or after the gateway is reinstalled following a Mail Data file
rebuild. If it has not, the Connection Name Utility (CNU) fails to run.

Additional query words: 3.20 Gateway Configuration Update CNU
