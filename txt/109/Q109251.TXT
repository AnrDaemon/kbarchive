TITLE   :Cannot Remount DoubleSpace Drive (ASPIDRVR.SYS and DOSOAD.SYS)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

Under some Bernoulli configurations, DoubleSpace-compressed drive C may
spontaneously unmount. Although the DoubleSpace-compressed drive is unmounted,
the compressed drive and host drive letters are still accessible, with both
drives showing the files on the host drive. Trying to mount drive C causes
DoubleSpace to report it is already mounted that drive.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you use the Bernoulli DOSOAD.SYS device driver and have
a SCSI host adapter that requires an ASPI device driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on using DoubleSpace, a ASPI device driver, and Iomega
DOSOAD.SYS device driver, contact Iomega.
