-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 5.5, 5.6 
 - Microsoft LINK for Windows NT, versions 1.0, 2.5, 2.55 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When building a project, the following error occurs during the link stage:

   CVPACK Fatal Error CK1024
   <modulename> cannot use program database <pdbfile> : signatures do
   not match

   -or-

   LINK: error LNK1202: "<path>\vc20.pdb" is missing debugging information
   for referencing module.

RESOLUTION
==========

The online help states the following:

   The .OBJ file modulename uses the .PDB file pdbfile, but the internal
   signature in pdbfile does not match the internal signature in modulename.
   Delete modulename, recompile, and relink. If a makefile is used, check the
   makefile dependencies.

The error can occur when a library contains debug information. When a library is
generated and built with debug information using the /Zi compiler option, the
debug information contained in the library references a .PDB file (by default
MSVC.PDB) on the computer where the library is built. A project that uses the
library on another computer has its own .PDB file. During the linking phase when
modules from the library are linked into the application, the linker checks to
make sure that the PDB file it finds is the same one that was used when the
library was built. Because the PDB file for the project is not the same one used
when building the library, the error occurs.

To resolve the problem, re-build the library using the /Z7 compiler option. This
will place all debugging information for the library modules into the modules
themselves. A .PDB file will not be referenced.
