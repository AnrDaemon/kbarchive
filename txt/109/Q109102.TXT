TITLE   :LM NETWKSTA.EXE Doesn't Load in UMA for MS-DOS 6.2 Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========


The Microsoft LAN Manager client workstation redirector (NETWKSTA.EXE) can be
loaded in the upper memory area under MS-DOS 5.0 and 6.0, but not if you upgrade
to MS-DOS 6.2.

This problem is verified on LAN Manager versions 2.20, 2.20a and 2.20b.

CAUSE
=====

The problem was traced to the LAN Manager redirector source code, which was not
allowing the redirector to be loaded high for MS-DOS 6.2.

During an optimization test under MS-DOS 6.2 that showed 129K of upper memory
available and one contiguous upper memory block as large as 94K, a NETWKSTA.EXE
that loaded properly under MS-DOS 5.0 and 6.0 still did not load completely in
upper memory.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem and hotfix CSD00.073 is provided to
fix it. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the hotfix.
