TITLE   :PRB: In Filer, Can't Move to Higher Folder in Hierarchy
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Filer will not allow you to move to a higher level in the folder hierarchy.

CAUSE
=====

A VOLUME command is set to the default folder, the contents of which are
displayed in the Filer window.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Switch to the Command window by pressing COMMAND+F2, and issue the following
   command:

   " SET VOLUME <drive letter> TO" (without the quotation marks)

2. Switch back to Filer. Attempt to move up to the folder in which FoxPro is
   contained. Note that you can still can't move to a folder above the current
   folder since Filer still thinks the volume label representing the current
   folder still exists.

3. Move down to a subfolder, such as Wizards. This forces Filer to update the
   Directories popup. Open the Directories popup. You can now view all the
   folders above the current folder up to and including the root of the folder
   structure.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Issue the following commands in the Command window. Replace the path to the
   Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh folder if necessary.

   SET VOLUME f TO fox:\foxpro
   SET DEFAULT TO fox:\foxpro

2. Open Filer. The contents of the fox:\foxpro folder are displayed. Note that
   the volume displayed is "f:".

3. Try to move to the root folder by clicking the Directory popup, or Folder
   popup in Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, in this case "fox:\". Note that you are
   unable to change folder levels.
