SYMPTOMS
========

Automatic paragraph numbers, AUTONUM fields, are not recognized or included in
the TOC field when you use TC fields and tables of contents (on the Insert menu,
click Index And Tables, and then click the Table Of Contents tab).

CAUSE
=====

When used in conjunction with TC fields, the results of the AUTONUM or
AUTONUMLGL fields work correctly within the TC field, but the numbers do not
appear in the table of contents.

For example if you insert

   {TC "{AUTONUMLGL} Proceedings"}

the resulting table of contents entry will look like:

   Proceedings.................................................1

WORKAROUND
==========

You can use a combination of SEQ fields to generate complex legal paragraph
numbering in a document. For example, to generate paragraph numbers as 1, 1.1,
1.1.1, and so forth, use the following sequence fields:

   {seq one}
      {seq one \c}.{seq two}
         {seq one \c}.{seq two \c}.{seq three}

Use the \c switch to keep the individual sequence numbers current. The SEQ field
without the \c switch increments to the next number. For example

   {TC "{seq one} Proceedings"}
   {TC "{seq one \c}.{seq two} Level2 Proceedings"\l2}
   {TC "{seq one \c}.{seq two \c}.{seq three} Level3 Proceedings"\l3}

results in the following table of contents:

   1. Proceedings.................................................1
        1.1 Level2 Proceedings....................................1
             1.1.1 Level3 Proceedings.............................1

The drawback to this workaround is the loss of automatic renumbering to maintain
the outline numbering structure. This means that you will need to edit the SEQ
fields to maintain the correct outline sequence if you move a paragraph. The
Auto Numbering Fields function is to maintain the numbering structure
automatically even if the paragraph is moved.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
