6.0  Using SMARTDrive Version 5.0

This section describes some solutions to problems that you might
encounter when using SMARTDrive version 5.0 (provided with Windows
for Workgroups) with specific applications or hardware.

6.1  Accessing Floppy Disk Drives on Older COMPAQ DESKPROS

On some COMPAQ DESKPRO 386/16 and 386/20 computers, you might
experience problems accessing floppy disk drives when SMARTDrive
version 5.0 is installed. To work around the problem, you can try one
of the following solutions:

 - Place the SMARTDrive buffer into low memory by adding the following
   option to the smartdrv command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

      smartdrv /L

 - Disable the caching on floppy disk drives by adding the following
   options to the smartdrv command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

      smartdrv a- b-

For more information about these options, see "Managing Memory and
Performance" in your Windows or Windows for Workgroups user's guide.

6.2  Using SMARTDrive with Double Buffering

Most expanded-memory emulators attempt to optimize SMARTDrive by
configuring it to load into upper memory blocks (UMBs). This will
cause problems if you are running Windows for Workgroups with double
buffering. If you need to use double buffering with SMARTDrive, make
sure that SMARTDrive is configured to load into low memory. The
SMARTDrive command line in your CONFIG.SYS file should look like
this:

   device=smartdrv.exe  /double_buffer

You do not need to change the references to SMARTDrive in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

If you're using a SCSI device, some vendors provide a driver (such as
ASPI4DOS) that supplies double-buffering already. You should not use
SMARTDrive double-buffering in this case. Check your SCSI device
documentation, or contact your SCSI device vendor to determine
whether your driver has its own double-buffering. If it does, use the
following command line:

   device=smartdrv.exe  /double_buffer+

This command line should also be used if your system hangs when
starting Windows, or if you are using a SCSI drive with a UNIX
partition.

For more information about using double buffering with SMARTDrive,
see "Managing Memory and Performance" in your Windows or Windows for
Workgroups user's guide.

6.3  Using SMARTDrive with Norton Utilities Version 6.0 Disk Monitor

Do not use the Disk Protect feature in Norton Utilities Version 6.0
Disk Monitor with SMARTDrive version 5.0. If you try to write to the
protected drive, you will encounter an error and your system will
fail. If you want to write to and cache a protected drive, add the
drive letter to the smartdrv command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
For example, if drive D is a protected drive, you would add the
following:

   smartdrv d

Or you can use the Norton cache program instead of SMARTDrive when
you are using Disk Monitor.

6.4 Using SMARTDrive with SuperStor Disk-Compression Utility

 - Do not use the Create Mountable Drive, Mount, and Dismount features
   of SuperStor after SMARTDrive is loaded. You must configure your
   SuperStor partitions before loading SMARTDrive. Windows for
   Workgroups Setup places the smartdrv command line first in your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If your AUTOEXEC.BAT file includes "mount"
   configuration commands, make sure that the smartdrv command line
   follows the SuperStor configuration command lines.

 - Also, you will receive read-write errors if you use SMARTDrive to
   cache a SuperStor compressed drive. To prevent SMARTDrive from
   caching the compressed drive, you must include the drive letter-
   option on the smartdrv command line.

   For example, if drive C is the uncompressed drive, and drives E and F
   are the compressed SuperStor drives, you would include the following
   command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

      smartdrv e- f-

6.5  Using SMARTDrive with Copy-Protected Games and Applications

When using SMARTDrive, you may encounter problems starting a
copy-protected application that requires you to place the master disk
in the floppy disk drive. To solve this problem, you need to disable
caching on the floppy disk drive by using the drive letter- option
when you load SMARTDrive. For example, if you load SMARTDrive from
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and you are using drive A, you need to include
the following command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   smartdrv a-

7.0  Using Multimedia Extensions Version 1.0 with Windows for Workgroups

This section covers information that is specific to using the
Multimedia Extensions version 1.0 with Windows for Workgroups. It
also covers additional tasks you need to perform to configure your
system properly for use with the Multimedia Extensions.

7.1  Upgrading to Windows for Workgroups

To use the Multimedia Extensions with Windows for Workgroups, first
set up Windows with Multimedia  Extensions version 1.0. Then upgrade
to Windows for Workgroups by installing it into the same directory.
If you set up Windows for Workgroups before setting up Multimedia
Extensions, not all the files will be properly installed.

7.2  Configuring MIDI Setups

When you set up Windows for Workgroups, Setup does not overwrite an
existing Multimedia Extensions MIDI-setup file MIDIMAP.CFG. If the
port settings in your original setups refer to the Ad Lib or Sound
Blaster ports and you are using different drivers, then you need to
change the port settings to match the output ports used by your sound
device. To do this, use the MIDI Mapper option in Control Panel.

For more information about using MIDI Mapper to modify MIDI setups,
see "Customizing Windows" or "Customizing Windows for Workgroups" in
your Windows or Windows for Workgroups user's guide.

7.3  Configuring Your Display

The Multimedia Extensions Display icon in Control Panel is not
available when you upgrade from Windows with Multimedia version 1.0
to Windows for Workgroups. If you need to change options for your
display, run Windows Setup from the Main group in Program Manager to
make these changes.

7.4  Sample MIDI File

The sample MIDI file CANYON.MID included with Windows for Workgroups,
which you can play with Windows Media Player, is provided by Passport
Designs, Inc.

7.5  Using HyperGuide

The information in HyperGuide refers to Windows version 3.0, not Windows
for Workgroups. If you need to use Windows documentation, see the Microsoft
Workgroup Add-on "User's Guide" that comes with Windows for Workgroups.

7.6  Using Music Box

Music Box is not fully compatible with Windows for Workgroups.
Although your compact discs will play correctly, you will encounter
problems when using the Save Info button in the Program dialog box to
save disc-title and track-title information. If you want to modify
this information, you must do so manually by editing the MUSICBOX.INI
file. To add a new disc to the file, you can determine the disc ID
number by viewing the information in the About dialog box.

7.7  Using Alarm Clock

The Alarm Clock in the Multimedia Extensions version 1.0 is not fully
compatible with Windows for Workgroups. If you are using the digital
display, the time may appear slanted or a system error may occur,
depending on the size of the Alarm Clock window.

8.0  Running Specific MS-DOS-Based Applications

This section provides information about running specific MS-DOS-based
applications with Windows for Workgroups.

8.1  Creative Labs JukeBox

If you are using a Sound Blaster sound card, do not set up or use the
JukeBox application included in your Sound Blaster package with
Windows for Workgroups. JukeBox interferes with the Windows for
Workgroups driver for the Ad Lib synthesizer and causes errors when
you try to install the drivers for the Sound Blaster card.

8.2  Games or Timing-Sensitive Applications

Some games or applications that rely on the computer's timer may
perform poorly in Windows for Workgroups. You can try increasing the
performance by turning off the TrapTimerPorts setting in the [386Enh]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file, as follows:

TrapTimerPorts=OFF

Note: The TrapTimerPorts setting is on by default. Turning it off may cause
errors or a loss of data when you transfer files by using a communications
application. It is recommended that you leave this setting turned on when
using a communications application.

8.3  Third-Party Expanded-Memory Emulators with MS-DOS Version 5.0 and 6.0

Many expanded-memory emulators will cause problems if you use them to
provide upper memory blocks (UMBs) for the MS-DOS version 5.0 or 6.0
loadhigh and devicehigh commands. If you want to use these MS-DOS
commands to load drivers or applications high, use the Windows
EMM386.EXE expanded-memory emulator to provide UMBs instead. If you
must use a third-party expanded-memory emulator, use the load high
feature provided with the emulator instead of using the MS-DOS
commands.

8.4  PC Tools Applications

If you run a PC Tools MS-DOS-based application in a window, the
display might be garbled, because PC Tools applications use a
graphics font that is not displayed correctly. (This problem does not
occur if you run the application in a full screen).

To correct the problem, start your PC Tools MS-DOS-based applications
by using the /NF option. If these applications are included in a
Program Manager group, use the Properties command to add the /NF
option to the command line for each application. For more information
about changing application properties, see Help for Program Manager.

You can also include the /NF option in the application's program
information file (PIF) by typing it in the Optional Parameters text
box in PIF Editor, or you can use the PC Tools PC Config program to
specify that PC Tools applications should use the Text Font to
display information. For more information about changing an
application's PIF, see your Windows or Windows for Workgroups user's
guide.

8.5  WordPerfect Version 5.1

When you run WordPerfect version 5.1 in a window, the Windows mouse
pointer and the WordPerfect mouse pointer do not appear in the same
place.

To fix this problem, carry out the following procedure.

1. In WordPerfect, press SHIFT+F1.

2. Press M for Mouse and A for Acceleration Factor.

3. Set the Acceleration Factor to 1.

4. Press ENTER three times to return to your document.

5. Enlarge the WordPerfect window to fill the entire screen.

6. Move the Windows mouse pointer into the WordPerfect window, and
   then move it to the far-right edge of the window.

7. Move the mouse pointer to the far-left edge of the window.

8. Move the pointer back to the center of the window, and then move
it down to the bottom edge.

9. Finally, move the pointer up to the upper-left corner of the window.

The Windows mouse pointer and the WordPerfect mouse pointer should
now be in the same location.

8.6   3270-Emulation Applications

You may encounter problems using certain 3270-emulation applications with
Windows for Workgroups. If you are using one of these applications, it is
recommended that you purchase the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Resource
Kit (Version 3.1). For information about ordering the resource kits, see
section 17 in this file.

8.7  C/C++ Version 7.0

If you are running Microsoft C/C++ Version 7.0 with Windows for
Workgroups and your system locks up when compiling a file, add the
following line to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:

MAXBPS=400

This command increases the number of breakpoints the system uses.

For more information about this setting, see the Microsoft Windows
for Workgroups Resource Kit (Version 3.1). For information about
ordering resource kits, see section 17 of this file.

9.0  Running Communications Applications

This section provides information on using communications
applications with Windows for Workgroups.

9.1  General Guidelines

The maximum bit rate possible when running your communications
program with Windows is determined by your CPU speed in addition to
your port and modem capabilities. RTS/CTS or hardware handshaking may
also be required.

To communicate at 9600 bits per second (BPS) or faster, follow these
guidelines:

 - Use Windows-based communications applications when possible.

 - Use 16550AF-compatible serial ports and modems. To determine if
   your serial port is 16550AF-compatible, you can run the Microsoft
   Diagnostics program (MSD.EXE) included with Windows for Workgroups.
   To run MSD, quit Windows, and then type msd at the command prompt
   (not from an MS-DOS prompt within Windows). Then press ENTER.

 - Avoid closing MS-DOS-based applications during a background download.

 - Use a PIF file to run MS-DOS-based communications applications.
   Use the PIF Editor to select the "Background Execution" and "Lock
   Application Memory" check boxes.

 - When you are running an MS-DOS-based communications application in
   the background, reduce it to an icon rather than running it in a
   window.

 - SMARTDrive may cause download errors when it clears the
   write-behind cache. If this happens, disable the SMARTDrive
   write-behind cache during high-speed downloads. This can be done
   easily using the SmartMon utility included in the Microsoft Windows
   for Workgroups Resource Kit (Version 3.1), and in MS-DOS 6.0. For
   information about ordering resource kits, see section 17 of this
   file.

9.2  Using an Intel CAS Modem with 32-Bit File Access

You cannot use an Intel CAS modem with 32-bit file access. If you are
using an Intel CAS modem, from Control Panel, select the 386 Enhanced
icon, choose the Virtual Memory button, and then choose the Change
button. Make sure the Use 32-Bit File Access check box is not
checked, and select OK. If it was checked, you must exit and restart
Windows.

10.0  Using Specific Display Adapters with Windows for Workgroups

This section describes some problems you might encounter when you use
specific display adapters or drivers with Windows for Workgroups.

10.1  Installing Display Adapters by Following the Manufacturer's
Instructions

The installation procedures that are provided by display-adapter
manufacturers may require you to replace or modify the SETUP.INF file
in the Windows SYSTEM directory. This will cause problems in Windows
for Workgroups.

If your third-party display-adapter installation replaces or modifies
the SETUP.INF file, use the following procedure instead.

To install the display-adapter drivers:

1. Rename the SETUP.INF file provided with your display-adapter
   package to OEMSETUP.INF, and place it on the disk or in the directory
   containing the third-party display-driver files.

2. From the Main group, run Windows Setup.

3. Choose Change System Settings from the Options menu.

4. From the list of Display options, choose Other Display (Requires
   disk from OEM).

5. Insert the disk that contains the OEMSETUP.INF file and the
   driver files for your display adapter. Or, if these files are located
   on your hard disk, type the path to the directory that contains the
   files, and then choose the OK button.

6. Select the type of display adapter you want to use, and then
   choose the OK button.

   Setup copies all necessary files from the driver disk and may request
   files from the Windows for Workgroups disks.

7. Insert any additional disks that are requested, and then choose
   the OK button.

If you accidentally overwrite the original SETUP.INF file, you can
copy it from Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 Disk 1 back into
your Windows SYSTEM directory.
