The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the network connection to the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice
volume is broken, the Microsoft Mail Connection gateway tries to reestablish the
connection during the next gateway cycle. If the file server and the Mail for PC
Networks postoffice volume are available, you are prompted to type in your
password. After you do so, the Postoffice volume reappears on the Desktop and
the gateway continues to deliver mail.

Configuring Guest access to the Mail for PC Networks postoffice volume allows the
gateway to remount the volume automatically without prompting for a password,
but compromises the security of the postoffice. Macintosh users can mount the
postoffice and view confidential information such as the Mail administrator's
name and password stored in the MACGATE.INI file.
