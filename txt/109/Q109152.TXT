SUMMARY
=======

In the FoxPro Report Writer, you can create a data grouping that will break
after a certain number of records.

For example, the following procedure will create a data grouping that breaks
after every fifth record.

1. Create a quick report based on the CUSTOMER database in the TUTORIAL
   subdirectory.

2. From the Report menu, choose Variables.

3. Choose Add to add a variable.

4. For the variable name, type "cntr" (without the quotation marks).

5. For the value to store, type "Customer.state" (without the quotation marks).

6. Select the Count radio button in the Calculate box and choose OK twice to
   return to the report.

7. From the Report menu, choose Data Grouping.

8. Choose Add to add a Data Grouping.

9. Enter the following expression to group on:
    - "INT(cntr/5)" (without the quotation marks)

10. Select OK twice to return to the report. You can now place fields and text
   in the group header and footer, which will print every fifth record.
