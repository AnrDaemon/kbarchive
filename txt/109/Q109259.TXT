SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks uses
the MACGATE.INI file to store gateway configuration information. You should NOT
change this gateway configuration information by manually editing the
MACGATE.INI file.

To change the gateway configuration options, log on to the Mail for AppleTalk
Networks gateway server as the Network Manager. From the Mail menu, choose
Gateway, then select Configuration. Edit the gateway configuration option and
click the Update button to save the changes to the MACGATE.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MACGATE.INI file contains configuration information that is used by both the
Macintosh and PC gateway components. Some of this information is read from the
MACGATE.INI file and stored by the Mail for AppleTalk Networks server in the
Microsoft Mail Data file when you click the Update button. If you manually edit
information in the MACGATE.INI file, these changes are not reflected in the Mail
Data file.
