SUMMARY
=======

When you are navigating through menus with the keyboard in FoxPro for Macintosh,
a delay will occur between menu options if a submenu is encountered. The submenu
will be displayed and a noticeable delay (about one second) will occur before
any other keyboard action can take place.

This behavior is by design. FoxPro for Macintosh was intended to be used with a
mouse.
