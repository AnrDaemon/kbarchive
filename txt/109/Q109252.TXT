 - Microsoft Cinemania 1994 editions 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Setup program for Microsoft Cinemania 1994 automatically generates a file
named MMPERF.TMP in the root directory of the installed drive. This file
provides multimedia personal computer performance diagnostic information. This
is a text formatted file, and can be opened and read with any text editor to
provide system related information for troubleshooting purposes.

For detailed information about the multimedia PC specification, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

NOTE: The MMPERF.TMP file is created during setup. There is no way to generate
this file outside of setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a description of the elements tested and included in the
MMPERF.TMP file.

Windows Major Version/Windows Minor Version
-------------------------------------------

This is the version of Windows reported by the system. For example, Windows 3.1
will report a major version of 3 and a minor version of 1. Multimedia PC
compatibility requires Windows version 3.1 or later. Windows 95 will report a
major version of 3 and a minor version of 95.


Number of Wave Audio Devices Hooked Up
--------------------------------------

This reports the number of Wave audio device drivers installed in the Drivers
section of Control Panel but does not include the Microsoft Audio Compression
Manager driver. Multimedia PC compatibility requires at least 1 valid Wave audio
device and driver.

Number of MIDI Devices Hooked Up
--------------------------------

This reports the number of MIDI audio device drivers installed in the Drivers
section of Control Panel, including standard MIDI support and any Stereo FM MIDI
device drivers. Multimedia PC compatibility requires at least 1 valid MIDI audio
device and driver.

Physical Memory
---------------

Measured in kilobytes (last zero not shown), this reports the free conventional
memory available to the system.

Virtual Memory
--------------

Measured in kilobytes (last zero not shown), this reports the free virtual memory
available to the system. Low virtual memory (less than 2 megabytes) can result
in the inability of Cinemania to play .AVI files (movie clips), display images,
or play sounds (music scores or movie still audio) correctly.

VGA
---

This reports whether the video card used on the system is at least VGA
compatible, which is the minimum allowable by the multimedia PC specification. A
value of 1 indicates a card capable of VGA or better display; a value of 0
indicates a card that is not capable of at least a VGA display.

256 Colors
----------

This reports whether the video card used on the system is at least 256-color
capable, which is recommended (not required) by the multimedia PC specification.
A value of 1 indicates a card capable of displaying 256 colors; a value of 0
indicates a card that is not capable of 256-color display. Cinemania 1994 will
use a grayscale palette if only a 16 color display is available.

CD-ROM Test
-----------

This reports whether the seek time achieved on the CD-ROM drive is less than or
equal to 1 second. Multimedia PC specification requires a maximum of 1 second
seek time (data access) from the CD-ROM. A value of 1 indicates 1 second or less
seek time; a value of zero indicates greater than 1 second seek time.

CPU Load
--------

This reports the percentage of CPU bandwidth used to read from the CD-ROM drive
at the current performance levels (transfer rate and seek time). Multimedia PC
specification requires that no greater than 40 percent of CPU bandwidth be
required to achieve 150K per second transfer rate. A reported value greater than
40 indicates that sound problems, jerky video, and slow performance may be
witnessed on the system.

XFER Rate
---------

Measured in kilobytes, this reports the actual kilobyte per second data transfer
being achieved by the machine. Multimedia PC specification requires no less than
150K per second transfer speed. A reported value less than 150,000 bytes (150K)
indicates that sound problems, jerky video, and slow performance may be
witnessed on the system.
