TITLE   :BUG: Browser Treats  Interface to Function  as a Subprogram
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the INTERFACE TO extension in a FORTRAN PowerStation application, the
Browser treats the INTERFACE statement as a function definition.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation 32 for
Windows NT and MS-DOS, version 1.0. and 1.0A We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the following example, lineto is listed twice in the Browser database. While
this is inconvenient when searching for the function, it does not affect the
behavior of your FORTRAN program.

Sample Code
-----------

         INTERFACE TO FUNCTION lineto(x,y)
         INTEGER*2 lineto[C,ALIAS:'__lineto'],x,y
         END
