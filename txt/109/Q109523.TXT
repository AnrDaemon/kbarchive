TITLE   :Windows NT Resource Kit Repair Utility Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run REPAIR /C to create a new Emergency Repair Disk, the utility starts
copying files to disks and may successfully create one or more disks. At some
point in the process, it starts prompting for new disks, reading them for a few
seconds without putting any files on the disk and then asking for another disk.
This continues as long as you insert new disks.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when a file that is too large for the floppy disk in use is
put into the repair directory when you run REPAIR /S or REPAIR /S /X. The file
in question could be one of your registry hives that has grown large or any file
that has been placed in the %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32 subdirectory since the
original Emergency Repair Disk was created.

RESOLUTION
==========

Currently, the only way to work around this problem is to locate the file in the
REPAIR directory that is too large and delete if from the directory before
running REPAIR /C. However, this solution does not work if the file in question
is one of the registry hives.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
