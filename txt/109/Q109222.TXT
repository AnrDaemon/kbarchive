 - Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a

SUMMARY
=======

Creative Writer and Fine Artist do not run in Windows 3.1 Standard Mode and
generate the following message if you try to run the program:

   You need to run Windows in Enhanced Mode to start Creative Writer.

   -or-

   You need to run Windows in Enhanced Mode to start Fine Artist.

The advanced animation and sound features in these programs require that Windows
be running in enhanced mode. These features are not adequately supported by
standard mode. That is why the product boxes state that you need a 386 or higher
processor, and recommend a minimum of 4 MB of RAM.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, follow these steps:

1. Exit Windows.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type "win /3" (without the quotation marks).
   This runs Windows in Enhanced Mode.

3. Start Creative Writer or Fine Artist.

After following these steps, you should be able to run Creative Writer or Fine
Artist successfully.
