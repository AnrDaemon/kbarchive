TITLE   :PRB: FoxPro Does Not Respond to Apple Events During READ
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

AppleScript generates a dialog box containing one of the following error
messages:

 - 

   Application "Microsoft FoxPro" Doesn't Understand the <AppleEvent>
   Message.

   -or-

 - 

   AppleEvent timed out.

CAUSE
=====

FoxPro does not respond to Apple events while a READ or a READ EVENTS command is
in effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: This problem occurs with most FoxPro .EXE and .APP files because they
usually contain a Foundation READ (GET-less READ). This causes the "AppleEvent
timed out" error message.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start the Script Editor, and enter the following code:

         tell application "Microsoft FoxPro" to quit

2. Save the script as an application. From the File menu, choose Save. In the
   dialog box that appears, select Application from the Format popup.

3. Quit the Script Editor, and start Microsoft FoxPro.

4. In the Command window, type the following code:

         @1,1 GET test DEFAULT SPACE(10)
         READ CYCLE

5. Click on the Macintosh desktop or choose the Finder application from the
   application menu on the far right of the menu bar.

6. With FoxPro now in the background, find the script you saved in step 2, and
   double-click the script to launch it. The script will tell FoxPro to quit,
   but the above error will be returned because a READ command is in effect.
