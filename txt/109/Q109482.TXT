SUMMARY
=======

When the FCREATE() function is used, FoxPro for Macintosh creates a FoxPro
document; by default, the Creator and Type of the file are set to:

   Creator - foxx
   Type    - TEXT

You can change the Creator and Type of a Macintosh file from within FoxPro for
Macintosh. For example, to change the Creator of the file to TeachText (ttxt),
issue the following commands:

   SET LIBRARY TO FOXTOOLS
   =FxSetType( "<filename>", "TEXT", "ttxt" ) && To change to
   TeachText

Additional query words: VFoxMac FoxMac
