The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On the Macintosh platform, the term "outshow" means to momentarily hide all the
windows that are currently displayed in front of the active output window.
FoxPro for Macintosh supports the outshow feature.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Outshow is enabled or disabled by placing the appropriate line in the CONFIG.FPM
file. By default, outshow is enabled.

To turn off outshow, add the following line to the CONFIG.FPM file:

   OUTSHOW=OFF

To turn on outshow, add the following line to the CONFIG.FPM file:

   OUTSHOW=ON

This setting can be changed only through the CONFIG.FPM file at FoxPro launch
time and cannot be changed programmatically during the FoxPro session.

To activate the outshow feature while FoxPro is the active application, press the
SHIFT+COMMAND+CTRL+OPTION key combination.

To demonstrate this feature, press the SHIFT+COMMAND+CTRL+OPTION key combination
while the Command window is in front of the FoxPro desktop. The Command window
will disappear and the FoxPro desktop will be the foremost window until you
release the keys.
