SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Schedule+ for the Apple Macintosh, if the "Distribute my
appointment boxes to other servers" setting in a user's Preferences dialog box
is turned off, the schedule information that has already been distributed to
other servers will not be deleted immediately. However, no new information will
be distributed.

The information that exists on other servers will be retained until it has aged
beyond the "Delete Schedule+ information more than X months old" setting in the
Administration Settings dialog box. Administration Settings can only be accessed
by the Network Manager.
