SUMMARY
=======

When you run Microsoft Windows Paintbrush with a monochrome display, such as VGA
Mono, EGA Mono, CGA, Paintbrush displays and prints using the black- and-white
palette only.

CAUSE
=====

Windows Paintbrush displays and prints according to the type of hardware
selected during Windows setup.

If you select a color display setting, Paintbrush displays in color and is
capable of printing in color if your configuration supports color printing (that
is, you have a color printer with the appropriate color printer driver installed
and the bitmap being printed is in color).

If you select a monochrome display, then Paintbrush displays a color bitmap using
a black-and-white palette, and is capable of printing in the black- and-white
palette only, regardless of the printer driver is installed.
