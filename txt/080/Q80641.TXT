The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows version 3.1 changes the way you use your mouse with MS-DOS
applications that run within a window. In Windows version 3.0, the mouse selects
text to be copied to the Clipboard. Windows version 3.1 instead sends the mouse
commands through to the MS-DOS mouse driver. If the driver supports the mouse in
an MS-DOS application running in a window, it sends the mouse command to the
application. The application interprets these mouse commands as if it were
running full-screen. If the MS-DOS mouse driver is not designed to receive mouse
instructions from the Windows version 3.1 mouse driver, the mouse does not
function in the MS-DOS application.

You can change the mouse behavior with Windows 3.1 to the way it works with
Windows version 3.0. This may be helpful if the MS-DOS mouse driver is not
capable of communicating with the Windows version 3.1 mouse driver, or if
selecting text is more important than mouse functionality in an MS-DOS
application running in a window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To force Windows version 3.1 to use the mouse to select text and copy it to the
Clipboard, add the following line to the SYSTEM.INI file under the
[NonWindowsApp] section:

   MouseInDOSBox=0

NOTE: You must exit and restart Windows to activate this change.

Removing this line or replacing the zero with a one (1) resets the mouse behavior
back to the Windows version 3.1 default.
