The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

According to Metheus technical support, the MS-DOS Shell screen may flash the
display boxes if Shell is configured for either VGA or EGA when using the
Megheus graphics card model 1104 or Premier 1Mb.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using the Metheus graphics card model 1104 or Premier 1Mb and have
configured Shell to use VGA or EGA mode, the display may flash the list boxes
where files names and directories are listed. To correct this problem, you need
to configure Shell for a CGA resolution.

To reconfigure Shell, do the following:

1. Expand the file CGA.GR_ (on disk 3 [5.25-inch set] or disk 2 [3.5-inch set])
   to the MS-DOS directory on your hard drive with the following command:

      expand a:\cga.gr_ c:\dos\dosshell.grb

2. Expand the file CGA.IN_ (on disk 3 [5.25-inch set] or disk 2 [3.5-inch set])
   to the MS-DOS directory on your hard drive with the following command:

      expand a:\cga.in_ c:\dos\dosshell.ini

3. Expand the file CGA.VI_ (on disk 2 [5.25-inch set] or disk 1 [3.5-inch set)
   to the MS-DOS directory on your hard drive with the following command:

      expand a:\cga.vi_ c:\dos\dosshell.vid
