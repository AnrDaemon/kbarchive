The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 2.11, 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There is no way to change the appearance of the command line cursor in MS-DOS
with any MS-DOS command. The cursor is a function of the BIOS and can only be
modified through a ROM BIOS call. There are third party applications that
facilitate this, such as Norton Utilities and PC Tools. You can also access the
BIOS and modify the cursor by using the MS-DOS Debug utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can write a short program to modify the MS-DOS cursor. One way to do this is
by creating and executing a short Debug script. The changes made are temporary
in memory. Therefore, if the goal is to have the cursor altered at all times, it
will be necessary to insert a line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to call the cursor
program on boot.

To change the appearance of the MS-DOS cursor, enter the following at the command
prompt:

Changing the value of n (1-4) will result in different appearances for the
cursor, where n=4 is a large cursor.

Insert the following line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to have the cursor loaded upon
booting the machine:

   c:\cursor.com

Note: This procedure relies on standard IBM ROM BIOS services and therefore
cannot be guaranteed to work on all systems. This information is only provided
