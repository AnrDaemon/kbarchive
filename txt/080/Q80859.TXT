SYMPTOMS

When you use WordStar 2000 version 3.5 Revision A, B, or C within Windows, the
following error may occur:

   This Application Has Violated System Integrity

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when your system attempts to use expanded memory for WordStar
within Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, you need to obtain a patch from WordStar 2000 technical
support. The patch disables WordStar's use of expanded memory.

expanded (EMS) memory does not prevent the error.
