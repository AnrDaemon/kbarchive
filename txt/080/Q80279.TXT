The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use an 8514/a or other SuperVGA type display and place the MS-DOS
Prompt or an MS-DOS-based application in a window in Windows 3.0 enhanced mode,
the window and the system font are small.

Modifying an entry in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file may make this
window larger and the font more readable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows supplies a number of "system" fonts for use in MS-DOS and Windows
applications. The default fonts for use in a windowed MS-DOS application are
EGA40WOA.FON, EGA80WOA.FON, CGA80WOA.FON and CGA40WOA.FON.

When the system fonts intended for EGA are used in a windowed MS-DOS application,
they show up very small because they are intended for a lower resolution screen
than the SuperVGA or 8514/a.

If the following lines appear in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file

      EGA80WOA.FON=EGA80WOA.FON
      EGA40WOA.FON=EGA40WOA.FON

you should change them to:

      EGA80WOA.FON=8514FIX.FON
      EGA40WOA.FON=8514FIX.FON

Once these modifications have been made, you must restart Windows.

The 8514FIX.FON file should be in the Windows SYSTEM directory. If it is not, use
the EXPAND.EXE utility to transfer it from the original Windows 3.0 disks.
