SUMMARY
=======

MathType is a mathematical equation editor designed for use with Microsoft
Windows. This program alters the WIN.INI and AUTOEXEC.BAT files during its
installation. MathType can be used within Microsoft Word for Windows or as a
separate installation in Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The memory requirement for MathType after starting Windows is 1.5 MB of RAM.
MathType requires 2 MB of hard disk space.

MathType adds the following font types to the WIN.INI file: [fonts]

   MTEXTRA.PFB (The MathType extra font)
   MTSYMBOL.PFB (The MathType symbol font)
   MTSYMITA.PFB (The MathType italic symbol font)
   FENCES.PFB (Contains large brackets, braces integers, etc.)

MathType adds the following extensions to the WIN.INI file:

   [extensions]

   EPS=mathtype.exe ^.eps
   WMF=mathtype.exe ^.wmf

Soft font information using these filenames also appears for each installed
printer. The following is a sample entry:

   [PostScript,LPT1]
   SoftFonts=4
   SoftFont1=E:\MT\PSFONTS\PFM\FENCES.PFM,E:\MT\PSFONTS\FENCES.PFB
   SoftFont2=E:\MT\PSFONTS\PFM\MTEXTRA.PFM,E:\MT\PSFONTS\MTEXTRA.PFB
   SoftFont3=E:\MT\PSFONTS\PFM\MTSYMBOL.PFM,E:\MT\PSFONTS\MTSYMBOL.PFB
   SoftFont4=E:\MT\PSFONTS\PFM\MTSYMITA.PFM,E:\MT\PSFONTS\MTSYMITA.PFB
   feed1=1
   feed15=1
   device=5

MathType changes AUTOEXEC.BAT by loading a PostScript font downloading utility if
it detects a PostScript printer. If you add a PostScript printer later, you must
add the downloading utility manually. The PSD.EXE entry follows the format
below:

   psd port:,speed,parity,databits,stopbits fonts

For example:

   psd com1:,9600,n,8,1 mtextra.pfb mtsymita.pfb fences.pfb

This entry is only required for downloading the soft fonts; it is not required
for correct operation of the program.
