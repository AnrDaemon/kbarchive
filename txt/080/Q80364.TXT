The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 2.11, 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs cannot be removed from the
environment unless you:

 - Reboot the system.

 - Alter the memory arena by finding the memory owned by the TSR and marking it
   as available.

 - Use a third party utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Two MS-DOS based programs, MARK and RELEASE by Turbo Software, are popular tools
when working with TSR programs. After you run MARK, you can load TSR programs
into memory and later remove them by running RELEASE. For more information on
MARK and RELEASE, contact Turbo Software at (719) 260-6641.

Byte magazine also has an in-house tool called KILLPROG. This program uses a hot
key sequence that checks for a safe time to use MS-DOS. It then checks the
memory arena structure and puts memory back together the way it was before
KILLPROG was loaded. KILLPROG also includes a command to take itself out of
memory when the user chooses to do so.

For more information on KILLPROG contact BYTE magazine at (800) 258-5485 and ask
for the December single month listing of KILLPROG. It costs $10.95 per copy.

The programs included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these programs' performance
or reliability.
