SUMMARY
=======

You can use manual dial with Remote Access Service (RAS) when using a
manual-dial modem or when placing a call through an operator. To use manual
dialing, perform the following steps:

1. Connect the telephone to the modem, as indicated in your modem user's guide.
   Modems usually have one socket to be connected to the telephone jack (in the
   wall), and another socket to be connected to the telephone.

2. Make an entry in the phone book without including a phone number; that is,
   leave the phone number field blank.

3. Select the entry, and from the Dial menu, choose Connect.

4. When the Connect dialog box appears, enter your password, but do not choose
   OK.

5. Pick up the telephone hand set and dial the number of the RAS server (or, in
   the case of an operator-assisted call, dial the operator and ask him or her
   to connect you to the RAS server's telephone number).

6. As soon as you hear the telephone ringing at the RAS server, choose OK in the
   Connect dialog box.

7. Wait until the Authenticating User message appears, then replace the
   telephone hand set.

For more information on manual dialing, search for "Dialing," then "Manual
Dialing" using the Help menu.
