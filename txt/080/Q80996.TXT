TITLE   :AHA-154x BID Doesn't Support I/O Addresses of 134/130

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The Adaptec 1540B/1542B BID that shipped with OS/2 version 1.3 for servers does
not support I/O addresses of 134/130. Instead, supported addresses are 334/330
and 234/230. If an address of 134/130 is used, the installation disk will be
unable to recognize the existence of the controller, and therefore, will not
install OS/2 on the machine.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because these I/O addresses are not supported, the jumper block labeled J7 on
the controller must not have pin 4 jumpered (I/O address of 134) or pins 2 and 4
jumpered (I/O address 130).

The following is the jumper block and a table of possible address selections:

        1 oo
        2 oo  ]
        3 oo  ]  I/O Address selection jumpers
        4 oo  ]
        5 oo
        6 oo
        7 oo
        8 oo
          J7
