The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information is useful for troubleshooting problems with the
AppleLink Gateway for version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks.

 - The AppleLink Comm application should be running at all times.

 - In the Chooser, the Mail server with the AppleLink gateway installed should
   be selected when MS Mail GW is selected.

 - For System 7.0, MS Mail GW version 3.0a must be used.

 - Check for a file named "AG Scratch" in the AppleLink Out Basket, which is
   located in the System Folder. The file "AG Scratch" is a temporary file that
   is created and then deleted after the AppleLink gateway completes a session.
   Delete this file if the AppleLink gateway is not currently connected and is
   not working correctly.

 - Make sure the "USA Modem.EF3.CCL" file included with the AppleLink gateway is
   correctly specified in the Gateway Configuration screen. This script file has
   been modified to work specifically with the AppleLink gateway.

 - See if the AppleLink application from Apple can be used successfully on the
   same machine with the same modem settings. If the AppleLink software is
   successful, then the AppleLink Gateway should be successful as well. Try
   sending another message at this point.

 - Make sure your modem is set for verbose mode, no error correction and Hayes
   modem emulation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Displaying the AppleLink Comm trace window can be very useful for debugging
problems with the gateway.

While troubleshooting a problem, select "Connect immediately when there is
outgoing mail" in the Gateway Connect Times screen for the AppleLink gateway.
The gateway should then attempt to connect to AppleLink when a mail message is
sent to an AppleLink recipient.
