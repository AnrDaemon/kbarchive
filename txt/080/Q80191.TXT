The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, 3.2a, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: OS/2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Presentation Manager client for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks is a
recompiled version of the Windows client. It uses the Windows Libraries for OS/2
(WLO) to provide program functionality.

When the Presentation Manager client for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks is
started, the program looks for a WIN.INI file in the OS2\DLL directory. If the
file is not present in that directory, the following error message is
displayed:

   Mail database cannot be reached

CAUSE
=====

For Mail to work correctly, it is not necessary to use the WIN.INI settings to
specify the mail database's drive or path; however, the WIN.INI file must be
present.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this error, create a text file with the name WIN.INI and save it in
the OS2/DLL directory.
