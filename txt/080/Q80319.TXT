TITLE   :BUG: Cannot Bind Programs that Increase the Number of Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::5.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN compiler for OS/2, version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Programs that have been linked with the modified startup code that allows more
than 15 open files will cause BIND.EXE to issue the following error:

   bv3.obj(bindv3) : error L2029: 'DOSSETMAXFH' : unresolved external

RESOLUTION
==========

Programs that increase the number of open files cannot be bound.

To increase the number of available open files under OS/2 involves calling the
OS/2 API DOSSETMAXFH. This API is not mapped during the binding process to the
equivalent MS-DOS interrupt 21h, function 67h.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in FORTRAN, version 5.1.

This is not an issue in FORTRAN Powerstation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code is a good sample program to test how many files can be open
at the same time. Compile with the following command line:

   fl /Fb /Lp a.for unit crt0dat /link /noe

where UNIT.OBJ and CRT0DAT.OBJ are OS/2 startup code modules that have be
modified to increase the number of file handles.

Sample code
-----------

   character*12 buffer

         do i=1, 10000
          write(buffer,'(i5,a)') i,'.dat'
          write(*,*) 'Filename is: ', buffer
          open(i,file=buffer,err=100,iostat=ierr)
         end do

   100   write(*,*) 'Error was: ',ierr

         do j=1,i
          close(j,status='delete')
         end do

         end
