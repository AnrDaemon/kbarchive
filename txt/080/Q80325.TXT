SUMMARY
=======

If an application sets the ALC_GESTURE bit in the alc field of the RC data
structure, the Microsoft Recognizer can return any one of the standard gestures
defined by the system. There is no method to define a subset of the standard
gesture set.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Windows for Pen Computing environment, an application can use the alc
field of the RC data structure to specify the set of characters to use during
recognition. Using this field, an application can specify a predefined set of
characters by using one of the predefined flags, or it can define its own set of
characters by using the ALC_USEBITMAP option. The ALC_USEBITMAP option allows
the application to specify any subset of the 256 characters in the ANSI
character set. Unfortunately, there is no method for an application to define a
subset of the gesture set.

Some application developers have requested the ability to define subsets of the
standard gesture set. This request is under consideration. Microsoft will post
new information here as it becomes available.
