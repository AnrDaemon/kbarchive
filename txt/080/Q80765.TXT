SUMMARY
=======

Currently, there is no specific printer driver for the Hewlett-Packard (HP)
Rugged Writer printer. According to Hewlett-Packard technical support, the Epson
LQ-1000 or LQ-1500 printer driver should be chosen when printing from Windows.

According to Hewlett-Packard technical support, the printer should be placed in
alternate mode by placing Dip Switch B-1 in the "up" position, which selects
Epson emulation.
