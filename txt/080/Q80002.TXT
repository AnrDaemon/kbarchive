KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Intuit has confirmed that all versions of Quicken should not be task swapped
from MS-DOS Shell. Task swapping Quicken may cause system hangs and/or result in
loss of Quicken data.

To avoid loss of Quicken data, disable Task Swapper.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Quicken is a finance program designed for individuals and small businesses.

When Quicken is task swapped from Shell, the Quicken program is not properly
closed. Quicken data files and indexes (.QNX files) are left open and are not
saved. This may cause Quicken file corruption.

To properly execute Quicken from Shell, Task Swapper should be disabled. To
disable Task Swapper, choose Enable Task Swapper from the Options menu. The
Active Task List will no longer be displayed.


The product included here, Quicken, is manufactured by vendors independent of
