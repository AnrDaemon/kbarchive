SUMMARY
=======

The FilterIndex property of the Common Dialog custom control (COMMDLG.DLL) can
be any long integer value, including negative numbers and 0 (zero).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally, the smallest value to which you would set the FilterIndex property is
1, because the first filter is defined as 1. If you use a number less than 1,
such as 0 or any negative number (within the range of a long integer), you will
get the same result as if you set it equal to 1.

Likewise, if you use a number greater that the total number of filters, the
FilterIndex property will function as if you set it to the last of the filters.

For example, if you have three filters and you set FilterIndex to -2, it will
function as if you set FilterIndex to 1. If you set FilterIndex to 23, it will
function as if you set FilterIndex to 3.
