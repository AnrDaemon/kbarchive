-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Walker Richer & Quinn (WRQ) has confirmed that their Reflection Network
Series version 1.11 and 2.0 products are compatible with MS-DOS versions 5.0 and
later, but require certain caveats when loading the network software into upper
memory using EMM386.EXE.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Reflection Network Series version 1.11 includes the following software:

   The 3000 Connection - To HP3000 hosts
   The LAT Connection - To DEC VAX hosts
   The TCP Connection - To tcp/ip systems
   The Telnet Connection - Works with third party tcp/ip stacks

The Reflection Network Series (except Telnet Connection) use the multiprotocol
Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) to allow simultaneous connection
to hosts using different protocols. They normally require the following files
loaded into the CONFIG.SYS file:

   device=c:\wrqnet\protman.dos
   device=c:\wrqnet\macwd.dos

(the above line varies according to network card)

   device=c:\wrqnet\wrqtcp.sys

(LAT Connection does not use WRQTCP.SYS).

The following should be included in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   c:\wrqnet\rndiseth /stacks:6
   c:\wrqnet\rndiseth /u
   c:\wrqnet\netbind
   c:\wrqnet\rndiseth /stacks:6

WRQ recommends you do the following when using MS-DOS 5.0 and later EMM386.EXE
and their Reflection Network Series programs.

1. PROTMAN.DOS MUST be loaded before HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE in the CONFIG.SYS
   file as follows:

      device=[path]\protman.dos
      device=[path]\himem.sys
      device=[path]\emm386.exe

2. In most circumstances, the device drivers can be loaded into the upper memory
   area (UMA), but if there are problems, Walker Richer & Quinn recommends
   loading them in conventional memory.

3. Do NOT load RNDISETH high.

4. NETBIND is not a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program. It merely
   performs a function then terminates, so there is no need to load it high.

5. Make sure to exclude the range of memory used by the EtherNet card when
   allocating upper memory. This is required when using the Western Digital card
   in particular. The start of the range can be found in the PROTOCOL.INI with
   the WRQ network directory. For example, if the network card was using 16K at
   address memory segment CC00, EMM386.EXE would be installed as follows:

      device=c:\dos\emm386.exe x=CC00-CFFF

6. Edit the STARTNET.BAT file in the WRQ network directory to add LOADHIGH
   statements to the network drivers.
