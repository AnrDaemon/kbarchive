SYMPTOMS
========

Cornerstone Technical Support has confirmed that the Cornerstone Full-Page
Display using the Type-A video card may have difficulty running the MS-DOS
prompt and other MS-DOS based applications while in Windows 386 enhanced mode.

Attempting to run MS-DOS applications in Windows enhanced mode may result in an
error message, such as:

   Insufficient Memory to Run Application

CAUSE
=====

According to Cornerstone Technical Support, this problem occurs because of a
hardware limitation of the Type-A video card. You may need to upgrade the Type-A
