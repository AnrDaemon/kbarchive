SUMMARY
=======

Tandy Corporation offers the following three Ethernet adapters:

   Tandy Ethernet Plus
   Tandy Ethernet Plus 16
   Tandy Ethernet Plus 16 TP

These adapters are actually manufactured by Western Digital Corporation and
correspond to the following cards:

   WD EtherCard Plus WD8003E
   WD EtherCard Plus 16 WD8013E
   WD EtherCard Plus 16 WD8013E TP

The MACWD driver included with LAN Manager should work correctly with these Tandy
cards. Choose Western Digital's Ethercard+WD8003E as your network adapter in LAN
Manager Setup. Non-default settings for interrupt and I/O base address must be
made to the PROTOCOL.INI file (as you would make for the Western Digital
cards).

Note: The WD EtherCard Plus 16 and the WD EtherCard Plus 16 TP are not currently
certified network cards for LAN Manager; therefore, the Tandy Ethernet Plus 16
and the Tandy Ethernet Plus 16 TP cannot be considered certified. If the 16-bit
Western Digital cards become certified in the future, the same drivers should
work correctly with the corresponding Tandy 16-bit cards.
