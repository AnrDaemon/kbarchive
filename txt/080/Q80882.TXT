======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Zenographic fonts for an HP PaintJet or PaintJet XL on a
shared network installation of Windows 3.0, the following error message may
appear:

   Error Processing Current Font ZFM File Not Built

NOTE: This information applies to the Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a.
This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.

CAUSE
=====

The following three PaintJet fonts for the PaintJet Series driver that are
supplied with Windows 3.0:

   CR124PA.PJF
   LG08RPA.PJF
   LG12RPA.PJF

During the installation of these fonts, a file named PJ$.ZFM needs to be created
in the shared directory of Windows 3.0. Once the PJ$.ZFM file is created, it is
necessary to leave the rights on this file set to write and read so that any
future changes to the fonts are saved in the PJ$.ZFM file without generating an
error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, you must have the authorization to write to the shared
copy of Windows 3.0 on the server. Change the PJ$.ZFM file rights to write and
read.
