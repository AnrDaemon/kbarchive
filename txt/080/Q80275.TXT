SUMMARY
=======

The Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet Series version 2.0 printer driver has the
ability to detect errors from the printer, such as running out of paper. The
enhanced error detection is only available when the printer is connected
directly to the computer (no print sharing devices and no network printing).
This may cause printing conflicts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When initializing a printer using the HP DeskJet Series version 2.0 printer
driver, the Initializing dialog box may stay on the screen for a prolonged
period of time with no error messages being returned. During this time, the
system will appear to be locked, but it will return within a few minutes.

If this happens, ask yourself the following:

1. Does the printer type specified in the series version 2.0 driver match the
   printer that is actually being used? If not, make the appropriate change.

2. Is the interface cable being used a standard parallel (that is, Centronics)
   or serial (that is, RS-232-C) cable? If not, try a standard cable.

3. Is the enhanced error detection enabled? If so, try disabling it. The
   enhanced error detection can be disabled by adding the following to the end
   of the WIN.INI file:

   [STATDLL]
   override=yes
