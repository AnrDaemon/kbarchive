KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Sound Blaster Pro includes a mixer-control program for Windows with Multimedia
Extensions version 1.0. The mixer-control application (SBMIXER.EXE) may cause
your machine to experience erratic behavior or lock up (hang) when running
Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

Creative Labs, the creator of Sound Blaster Pro, is aware of this problem and
has provided an updated version of the mixer to solve this problem. The updated
version puts the mixer into the Windows Control Panel.

If the file size of SBMIXER.EXE is 25792 and/or the SNDBLST.DLL file size is
23776, then an upgrade is necessary.

To obtain this upgrade, contact Creative Labs Technical Support or connect to the
Creative Labs bulletin board service (BBS).

The Creative Labs product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
