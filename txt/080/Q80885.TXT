The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

An invalid PATH= statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file may result in the
inaccessibility of the Microsoft Windows groups within Program Manager. This
occurs when you start Windows from the root directory, but does not occur when
you start Windows from the WINDOWS directory.

To prevent this, verify that the PATH= line syntax is correct.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the path is set as follows, the groups within Program Manager will be
inaccessible

        PATH=C:WINDOWS

where C is the drive and WINDOWS is the directory in which Windows 3.0 resides.

To allow access to the groups within Program Manager, verify that the path
statement reads as follows:

        PATH=C:\WINDOWS
