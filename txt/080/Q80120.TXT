TITLE   :FIX: MASM 6.0 May Incorrectly Generate A2032 for EQU
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.0,6.0a,6.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Macro Assembler may incorrectly generate the following error:

   A2032: invalid use of register

CAUSE
=====

This is demonstrated on lines eight and nine in the sample code below. The error
occurs because the LEA and MOV instructions on those lines use an equate and a
register as an address. In the example, table1 is equated to the value of the
location counter, "$", and the register is BP.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, use the LABEL directive rather than an equate of the
current location counter.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 6.0, 6.0a, and
6.0b. This problem was corrected in MASM for MS-DOS version 6.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code can be used to demonstrate the problem.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: none

   code SEGMENT word public 'code'
   ASSUME cs:code

   table1 EQU $
   ;table1 LABEL word      ; Use this line instead of previous one.

      lea di, table1[bp]   ; line 8
      mov ax, table1[bp]   ; line 9
   code ENDS
