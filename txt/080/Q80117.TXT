======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0, when defining ?WIN on the
command line and including CMACROS.INC, the following errors are generated:

   cmacros.inc(77): error A2016: expression expected
   cmacros.inc(118): error A2008: syntax error: ,

CAUSE
=====

The command-line switch /D?WIN=1 is equivalent to ?WIN TEXTEQU <1>.
CMACROS.INC is expecting that ?WIN = 1 will be used to indicate that Windows
support is needed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correctly define ?WIN, do not assemble with /D?WIN=1 as a command line
option; instead, use "?WIN = 1" in the source file before including CMACROS.INC.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following examples demonstrate the incorrect and then the correct way to
define ?WIN for use with CMACROS.INC.

Sample Code 1: Incorrect
------------------------

   ; Assemble options needed: /D?WIN=1

     INCLUDE CMACROS.INC

     END

Sample Code 2: Correct
----------------------

   ; Assemble options needed: none

      ?WIN  =  1              ; ?WIN must be defined before the include.
      INCLUDE CMACROS.INC

      END
