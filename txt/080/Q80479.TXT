The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows allows the creation of a permanent swap file on a disk compressed with
the Digital Research (DR) DOS version 6.0 utility, SuperStor (SSTOR.EXE).
SuperStor is a utility included with the DR DOS 6.0 operating system. However,
if you attempt to load Windows in 386 enhanced mode with a swap file on a
SuperStor drive, a corrupt swap file error results.

To prevent this error, re-create the permanent swap file on a drive that is not
compressed with SuperStor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "DR DOS 6.0 User's Guide" states the following in Appendix E:

   Also, remember that Windows permanent swap files cannot be stored on a
   SuperStor compressed disk. Running the SuperStor utility, SSTOR.EXE, on a
   disk and then creating the Windows permanent swap file on the compressed disk
   may generate the following message on attempting to load Windows in 386
   enhanced mode:

   Corrupt Swap File Warning

   Your swap file is corrupt. See Chapter 13, "Optimizing Windows," in the
   "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for instructions about re-creating the
   file.

   Press any key to continue

Microsoft Windows may then come up in enhanced mode after you press any key
(without the use of a swap file) or may not load at all on some systems.
