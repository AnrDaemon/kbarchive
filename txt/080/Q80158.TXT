SUMMARY
=======

The Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) may display improper storage status
(0 mailbags, 0 files, and 0 bytes used) if the Admin mail logon does not have
proper directory search rights. Under Novell, the Admin logon must have filescan
rights in order to determine the file sizes of the .MAI or .MBG files and create
a status on the files in those subdirectories.

The status display will show 0 bytes when you choose Local-Admin, Storage,
Status, Post Office or choose Local-Admin, Storage, Specific Users.

The search rights for Novell can be viewed or changed by using the NetWare rights
command.

Additional query words: 2.10 3.00 admin novell
