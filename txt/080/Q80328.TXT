SUMMARY
=======

The built-in screen saver on the ULTIMA LSX notebook cannot detect keystrokes
when Microsoft Windows is running. Therefore, the screen cannot be restored
unless you have a mouse.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Phoenix BIOS (version A386 1.01) on an ULTIMA LSX notebook computer contains
a screen saver routine that will blank the video display after a user-specified
amount of time. Whenever the BIOS detects a keystroke or mouse movement, the
screen control returns to the active application.

Under Windows, keystrokes are not passed directly to the BIOS. Therefore, unless
a mouse is connected to the system, there is no way to return to the active
application, and the system simply stays locked in the screen saver. This
happens in all modes of Windows (real, standard, and enhanced).

The screen saver can be disabled through the CMOS setup. To disable the BIOS
screen saver, follow the instructions beginning on page 5-1 of the "ULTIMA LSX
User Manual." For additional information, see the diagram on page 5-7 of the
"ULTIMA LSX User Manual."
