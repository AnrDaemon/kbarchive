SUMMARY
=======

You can change the font that Windows uses to display text in menus, title bars,
and dialog boxes by using the the SystemFont= setting in the [Windows] section
of the WIN.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The system font that Windows uses to display text in menus, title bars, and
dialog boxes is generally defined by the Fonts.Fon= statement in the [boot]
section of SYSTEM.INI. However, if you add the line SystemFont=<fontname>
to the [Windows] section of WIN.INI, Windows uses the font that you specify.

NOTE: Some dialog boxes cannot be changed, for example, the Exit Windows and Task
List dialog boxes.

Valid font files are raster fonts with the extension .FON. For example, a valid
WIN.INI entry on a VGA system would be:

        SystemFont=coure.fon

This would change the system font to Courier. The file COURE.FON must be present
in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory in its expanded form.

Choosing one of the Windows vector fonts (Modern, Roman, or Script) results in
abnormally large screen text. Choosing the Symbol font results in unintelligible
Windows system text.
