TITLE   :FIX: ALIGN Immediately After INCLUDE Generates L1101
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 generates an invalid object
module when given code that contains an INCLUDE directive followed immediately
by an ALIGN directive. The contents of the included file are not important; it
can even be an empty file. The linker may not issue a warning. If the linker
does detect the error, it generates the following:

   error L1101: invalid object module

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, place the INCLUDE directive at the beginning of the
file so that the ALIGN directive does not immediately follow the INCLUDE
directive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you assemble the following sample code with /Zi, the linker will detect the
invalid object module and issue the error message. Without /Zi, no warning is
given and the program terminates normally, but the object module is still
invalid.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: none
   ; The file FILE.INC needs to be created, but may be left empty.

   _text   SEGMENT para public 'code'
           ASSUME  CS:_text

   start:  mov cx, 0100h
   INCLUDE FILE.INC
           ALIGN 4
   loopx:  mov ax, 4C00h
           int 21h

   _text   ENDS

   END     start
