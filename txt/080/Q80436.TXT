SUMMARY
=======

Hewlett-Packard (HP) has confirmed that when using the HP DeskJet Series printer
driver versions 2.0 and 3.0 with enhanced error detection enabled, Windows Print
Manager is ignored.

To enable Print Manager, disable the enhanced error detection feature.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use Print Manager with the HP DeskJet printer driver versions 2.0 and 3.0,
the printer driver's enhanced error detection must be disabled. To enable the
Print Manager, select the Use Print Manager check box in Control Panel.

To turn off the enhanced error detection, add the following lines to the WIN.INI
configuration file (located in the directory in which Windows was installed):

      [STATDLL]
      override=yes

If these lines are not added to the WIN.INI file, or if the following entry is
used, the printer driver will default to using enhanced error detection:

      [STATDLL]
      override=no
