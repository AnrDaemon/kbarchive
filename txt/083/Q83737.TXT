======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Wyse Technical Support has confirmed that if Windows 3.1 is run in 386 enhanced
mode on a Wyse Decision model 386/SX 16, 20, or 25, the following symptoms may
occur after you leave the computer idle for a short period of time:

 - The speaker beeps erratically if you press a key.

 - The alarm sounds if you type in any dialog box.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this behavior from occurring, disable the clock speed switch, as
follows:

1. Insert the Wyse Setup and Test Diskette in drive A.

2. Turn on the monitor and the system, and wait approximately 40 seconds for the
   Setup and Test Program Main Menu to be displayed on the monitor screen.

3. Press the F1 key. The Setup System Configuration screen will be displayed
   with the designation next to "Base memory" selected.

4. Press the DOWN ARROW key until the designation next to "Clock Speed Switch"
   is selected.

5. Press the F2 key until the designation changes to OFF.

6. Remove the Setup and Test Diskette.

7. Press the F5 key twice to save the new system configuration and reboot the
   system.

Once the computer reboots, the system is ready for proper operation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem described above occurs because some Wyse 386 machines experience
keyboard problems while running Windows in 386 enhanced mode. If the machine is
left idle for a short period of time and then keyboard is touched, the machine
will behave erratically and then operate as normal.
