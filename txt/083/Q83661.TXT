SUMMARY
=======

In the Windows environment, an application cannot use the WM_DDE_EXECUTE message
to execute a Microsoft Excel function that returns a value. Excel enforces this
limitation because it has no mechanism to provide the return value to the client
application. If the client application is not interested in the function's
return value, it can work around this limitation by posting a WM_DDE_EXECUTE
message to Excel with commands to do the following:

 - Create a macro sheet.

 - Write the desired function call to the macro sheet.

 - Run the macro.

DDEXL is a sample in the Microsoft Software Library that demonstrates this
technique. DDEXL allows the user to initiate a conversation with Excel, execute
a series of Excel commands, which draw a chart (using CREATE.OBJECT), and
terminate the conversation.
