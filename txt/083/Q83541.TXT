The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.x, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following are error messages that can be sent to the Network Manager when
using the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks Gateway to Fax:

 - 

   Error encountered while trying to fetch and send FAXGATE log. Error: -1

 - 

   Error encountered while writing to Outbox. Error: -1

 - 

   FAXGATE encountered a "Connect Times..." schedule problem. Error: -1

 - 

   Could not locate BackRas. Check to see that it is in your system folder.
   Error: -1

These errors can appear if Gateway Services, MS Mail GW, is loading on more than
one Macintosh on the Mail system AND it is also selected via Chooser to the Mail
server running the fax gateway. Gateway Services downloads and runs gateway code
from the Mail server datafile. When the fax gateway code is downloaded and run
on a Macintosh that does not have the fax gateway INITs and the BackFax Files
folder are not present, the above errors can be generated. To correct this
problem, remove the MS Mail GW from the Macintosh NOT running the fax gateway.
Gateway Services should only be loaded on the Mail server running the fax
gateway.
