The information in this article applies to:

 - The App Studio, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

App Studio and Developer Studio do not support printing a dialog box, bitmap,
icon, cursor, or other resource. However, you can copy the image of a resource
and paste it into Microsoft Paint, Word, or another graphics program and print
the image in that application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To print the image of a dialog box, perform the following four steps:

1. Start App Studio or Developer Studio and open or create a dialog box.

2. Press ALT+PRINT SCRN to copy the image of the dialog box to the clipboard.

3. Start Paint (or another program) and choose Paste from the Edit menu.

4. Choose Print from the File menu to print the dialog box.

Note that this process only captures the image of the dialog box that is
currently open in the resource editor. You can use ALT+PRINT SCRN to copy to the
clipboard the image of any dialog box or window in the Microsoft Windows
environment. This feature is available in Windows NT and when 16- bit Windows
runs in 386 enhanced mode.

Windows captures the image of the dialog box in bitmap (.BMP) format. You can use
Paint to change any features of the dialog box image before you print it.
