-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Use of the MS-DOS versions 4.x GRAPHICS.COM file in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file may
cause one of the following error messages to appear in Windows 3.1 File
Manager:

   Cannot read drive I

   -or-

   Error reading drive I

   -or-

   Drive I does not exist

CAUSE
=====

Some applications, such as Harvard Graphics, install GRAPHICS.COM. If you are
using MS-DOS 4.x, this error may occur after you install Windows 3.1.

If you choose the OK button when the error appears, File Manager displays all of
the legitimate drive icons, but the files within the subdirectories are
inaccessible.

This error does not occur with later versions of MS-DOS.


WORKAROUND
==========

To correct the problem, remove the reference to the MS-DOS 4.x GRAPHICS.COM file
from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
