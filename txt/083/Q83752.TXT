The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Under Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, if the Windows 3.1
COMM.DRV driver is not installed correctly, the button for the advanced section
of Ports in Control Panel is unavailable (dimmed). The correct entry for the
Windows 3.1 COM driver in the SYSTEM.INI file is:

      [Boot]
      COMM.DRV=COMM.DRV

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 3.1 Setup does not upgrade third-party device drivers. Because there is
no guarantee that the third-party device drivers are not required to run your
installation of Windows, Setup may not be able to complete the installation of
Windows 3.1 if the drivers are removed.

If the Communications port driver entry is not correct, do the following:

1. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file with a text editor and change the COMM.DRV entry as
   shown above.

2. Using the EXPAND command (EXPAND.EXE), expand COMM.DRV from the original
   Windows 3.1 disks by typing the following:

   EXPAND A:COMM.DR_ C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\COMM.DRV

NOTE: The COMM.DR_ file is located on Disk 1 of the 1.44 MB (3.5-inch) disk set;
and Disk 2 of the 1.2 MB (5.25-inch) and 720K (3.5-inch) disk sets.
