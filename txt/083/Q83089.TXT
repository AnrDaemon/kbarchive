TITLE   :FIX: Tracing into MOVE Startup May Cause R6915 Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft CodeView Debugger (CV) version 4.0 may cause the following
run-time error when tracing through startup code in programs that use the
Microsoft Overlaid Virtual Environment (MOVE):

   run-time error R6915 -
   DOSX16: unhandled exception

After generating this error, CodeView usually returns to MS-DOS, but may generate
other errors or hang. Even if CodeView does not generate an error or hang, you
may not be able to reboot your machine by hitting Ctrl-Alt- Del.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in CodeView version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in CodeView version 4.01.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MOVE allows users to overlay both code and data to run MS-DOS programs that are
larger than available MS-DOS memory. MOVE can take advantage of EMS or XMS
memory.

The Microsoft CodeView Debugger version 4.0 is compatible with overlaid programs
created with MOVE.
