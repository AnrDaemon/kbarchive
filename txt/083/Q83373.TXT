The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to install MicroSpeed PC-Trackball pointing devices
for use with Windows 3.0.

These devices can be operated properly when the "Microsoft or IBM PS/2 mouse
driver" option is selected while setting up Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MicroSpeed PC-Trackball has four interfaces:

 - Serial

 - PS/2 mouse port

 - Microsoft InPort mouse port

 - Bus card

Of the four interfaces, the bus card interface is the only one not currently
recommended for use with Windows 3.0.

Installing the PC-Trackball with Bus Card Interface
---------------------------------------------------

If you use the MicroSpeed PC-Trackball with the bus card interface, you cannot
use Windows 3.0 standard or 386 enhanced mode. If you start Windows 3.0 in
standard or 386 enhanced mode with this device, the logo screen will briefly
appear and then Windows will return to the MS-DOS command prompt. Windows runs
correctly in real mode with this bus card.

To work around this problem, connect the PC-Trackball to one of the serial ports
and select "Microsoft or IBM PS/2 mouse driver" as the pointing device during
Windows setup.

MicroSpeed is aware of this problem and is working on a new driver.

Installing the PC-Trackball Serial, InPort, and PS/2 Mouse Port
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Connect the PC-Trackball to the proper port. Do not install any MicroSpeed
   mouse drivers. If these drivers have been installed, edit the CONFIG.SYS and
   AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Look for the names PPR.SYS, PPR.COM, and POINTER.BAT and
   remove them.

2. If the PC-Trackball is replacing a Microsoft or PS/2 mouse, install for a
   Microsoft or PS/2 mouse.

3. If Windows 3.0 is not installed, run the Windows 3.0 Setup program and follow
   the instructions for installing Windows for use with a Microsoft or PS/2
   mouse.

4. If you are planning to use the PC-Trackball with non-Windows applications,
   install the Microsoft mouse driver version 7.04 or later in either the
   CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The Windows 3.0 Setup program may do this.
   If it does not, use the Windows EXPAND.EXE utility located on Disk 2 of the
   Microsoft Windows 3.0 disk to decompress the MOUSE.SY$ file into the root
   directory as MOUSE.SYS and then edit the CONFIG.SYS file and add the
   following line:

   device=c:\mouse.sys /y

Note: MicroSpeed's KEYMAP.COM program should not be used when running Windows
3.0.
