-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The advanced power management (APM) icon does not show up in Control Panel on
AST APM laptops under Windows version 3.1 unless you use SLEEP.SYS, version
3.1.

According to AST technical support, SLEEP.SYS, version 3.1, is required for APM
to function correctly with Windows 3.1. You can download this file in its
compressed format (PEXEC386.ZIP) from the AST bulletin board.

If your BIOS version is 1.06 or earlier, you should contact AST for a BIOS
upgrade, as this version does not work correctly with SLEEP.SYS version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more instructions on installing APM for Windows 3.1, please see section 5.0,
"Using Advanced Power Management (APM)," in the Windows 3.1 README.WRI file.

In addition, make sure the correct settings are in the SYSTEM.INI file, as
follows:

      [386Enh]
      device=vpowerd.386

      [boot]
      drivers=power.drv

NOTE: Windows does NOT set up automatically for APM machines. You must run the
maintenance mode of Setup and select one of the APM machines.
