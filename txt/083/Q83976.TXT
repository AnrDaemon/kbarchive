SUMMARY
=======

If you run Great Plains Accounting software version 6.1 in the Microsoft Windows
operating system version 3.1 and the FILES statement in your CONFIG.SYS file is
set to less than 50, MS-DOS run-time errors occur.

Great Plains technical support recommends using a minimum setting of FILES=50 for
a single-user environment and FILES=60 for a multi-user environment. It may be
necessary to increase these values.

You may get the following error messages when running Great Plains from Windows
3.1:

   Cannot Read from Drive C:

   -or-

   Cannot Run this Application in a Window

MORE INFORMATION

may appear. Edit line seven, in Printer Setup-SY5020, within the Great Plains
Accounting System Utilities menu. Change the Printer Device Name from PRN: to
LPT1:.

Cannot Run this Application in a Window
---------------------------------------

The error message

   Cannot Run this Application in a Window

may appear if the video memory option of the PIF is set to High Graphics. Change

to use version 6.1 (an MS-DOS-based application) with Windows version 3.1.
