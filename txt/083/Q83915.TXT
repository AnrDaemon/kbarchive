In the NoTitle.exe sample, when the window has a caption and the user selects
NoTitle from the main menu, the caption is removed. When the user double- clicks
the window without a caption by using the left mouse button, the caption is
added to the window.

NoTitle.exe removes the caption by performing the following five steps:

1. Removes the menu from the window by calling the SetMenu() function with NULL
   as the hMenu parameter.

2. Retrieves the current window style by calling GetWindowLong with GWL_STYLE as
   the nIndex parameter.

3. Removes the caption bit.

4. Calls SetWindowLong() with GWL_STYLE to change the style of the window.

5. Calls InvalidateRect() to instruct the application to redraw the window.

NoTitle.exe places the caption on the window by performing the following five

   as the nIndex parameter.

3. Adds the caption bit.

4. Calls SetWindowLong() with GWL_STYLE to change the style of the window.

5. Calls InvalidateRect() to instruct the application to redraw the window.
