The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In an application that uses the Print dialog box provided by the common dialog
boxes Dynamic-Link Library (DLL), when the user selects HP DeskJet Printers in
the Specific Printer combo box, the value PDERR_NODEVICES (0x1007) is returned
to the application.

CAUSE
=====

The Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 500C printer driver was installed incorrectly.
The HP DeskJet driver provided with Windows 3.1 does not support the HP DeskJet
500C.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reinstall the HP DeskJet 500C printer driver through the Control Panel. When the
Install Driver dialog box prompts for a vendor- supplied printer driver disk,
insert the driver disk provided with the printer. For additional information on
this procedure, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   install and deskjet and 500c


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PrintDlg() displays the Print dialog box. After the user selects a printer and
dismisses the dialog box, PrintDlg() sets the fields of a PRINTDLG data
structure to reflect the selections.

In the case described above, the hDevMode field points to a DEVMODE data
structure in which the dmDeviceName field is set to "HP DeskJet." However, the
printer name is listed in the [devices] section of the WIN.ini file as "HP
DeskJet Printers." Because the two entries do not match, PrintDlg returns the
PDERR_NODEVICES error to the application.
