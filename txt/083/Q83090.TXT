TITLE   :BUG: LIB Corrupts Import Library Extended Dictionary

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LIB for MS-DOS, versions 3.17, 3.18, 3.2, 3.31, 3.4 
 - Microsoft LIB for OS/2, versions 3.17, 3.18 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Library Manager (LIB) can be used to merge import libraries,
created with IMPLIB, into larger import libraries. This may be useful when
IMPLIB runs into capacity limits while trying to create one large import
library. However, if you use LIB to merge multiple import libraries and use
default options, the resulting import library will have an invalid extended
dictionary.

RESOLUTION
==========

Import libraries should not have extended dictionaries. You can use the /NOE
switch to avoid the generation of an invalid extended dictionary when merging
import libraries.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in LIB versions 3.17, 3.18, 3.2,
and 3.31 for MS-DOS and versions 3.17 and 3.18 for OS/2. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LINK uses the extended dictionary to speed up library searching. For example, if
a function in module A of a library calls functions in module B and module C of
the same library, the extended dictionary informs LINK, so that if your program
requires module A from the library, LINK pulls in modules A, B, and C all at
once. This way, LINK does not have to search the library again to resolve
references from module A to functions in modules B and C.

In import libraries, modules do not contain any code; they only contain
references to DLLs. Thus, import library modules do not contain function calls
or external references to other modules. Because there are no cross dependencies
between modules, the extended dictionary for an import library need not contain
anything.
