The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The installation program for the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) version
3.1 does not provide an option to copy individual SDK components from the
distribution disks. Each time the SDK installation program is run, it calculates
the amount of disk space required to install the required components and any
requested optional components. Because the installation does not proceed unless
the calculated amount of disk space is free, it may be necessary to remove the
existing SDK installation before using the installation program.

However, the EXPAND utility can be used to copy individual files from the
installation disks to the hard drive. It is necessary to use the EXPAND utility
because the files on the SDK distribution floppy disks are in a compressed
format. The EXPAND utility is provided with Windows 3.1 and also with MS-DOS
5.0.

The Windows SDK 3.1 is also distributed on CD-ROM (compact disk read- only
memory). Because files on the CD-ROM are not compressed, any MS-DOS file copy
utility can copy these files to the hard disk.

For more information on installing the Windows SDK version 3.1, including an
article that provides the recommended installation procedure, query on the
