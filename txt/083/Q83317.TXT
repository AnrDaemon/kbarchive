SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 Shell will display a normal graphic pointer inside a black
box if you use the Microsoft Mouse driver version 8.1 and configure the pointer
size to large.

To remove the black box from around the pointer, use an editor (for example,
MS-DOS Editor or Edlin) to edit the MOUSE.INI file, and set the
POINTERSIZE=small in the [DOSPOINTER] section.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A feature of Microsoft Mouse driver 8.1 is that you can have a large mouse
pointer. This large pointer may also include the regular graphic pointer
embedded within it. To display the large mouse pointer, do the following:

1. Open the MOUSE.INI file in MS-DOS Editor (or another text editor). MOUSE.INI
   should be in the \MOUSE or \WINDOWS directory.

2. In the [DOSPOINTER] section, set POINTERSIZE=large. For example:

   [DOSPointer]
   PointerSize=large

   NOTE: The entry is not case sensitive.

3. Save the changes you made in the MOUSE.INI file, and reboot the machine so
   the changes will take effect.

4. Execute Shell.

The mouse pointer will display surrounded by a black box.
