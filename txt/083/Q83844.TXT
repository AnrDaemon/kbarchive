The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the README.WRI file included with Windows 3.1, section 4.1 gives an erroneous
syntax for installing the MONOUMB2.386 device driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The syntax reported for expanding the device driver is given as:

      EXPAND A:\MONOUMB2.38_ C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM

Using this syntax causes the placement of the expanded file into the
WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory with an incorrect file name. The correct syntax is:

      EXPAND A:\MONOUMB2.38_ C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MONOUMB2.386

If the file has already been expanded with the incorrect syntax, all that is
necessary is to rename the file to the correct file extension. From the
WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory, type the following command:

   REN MONOUMB2.38_ MONOUMB2.386

This will prevent the following error message from appearing when you attempt to
run Windows in 386 enhanced mode:

   Unable to load a device driver that may be necessary to run Windows in 386
   Enhanced Mode: MONOUMB2.386

Additional query words: 3.10 documentation error
