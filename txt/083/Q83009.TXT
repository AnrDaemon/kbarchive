======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In an application that uses the File Open or Save As dialog box from the Common
Dialogs dynamic-link library (DLL), when the user opens a combo box with the
mouse, holds down the left mouse button, and then presses the ESC key to close
the dialog box, a GP-fault occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can ignore the faults that result from calling GetOpenFileName() and
GetSaveFileName() without incident. There are as many as eight warnings before
control is returned to the application.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Common Dialogs DLL version 3.1.
