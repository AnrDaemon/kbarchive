SUMMARY
=======

Some third-party font packages may have problems under certain circumstances
when running with Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1. This article
discusses some of the common problems and possible solutions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

COMMON FONT PACKAGE PROBLEMS
----------------------------

 - When installing Windows 3.1 to upgrade from Windows 3.0, the SYSTEM.INI
   [boot] section's display.drv= may not get updated if a font package has
   changed this line from one of Windows 3.0 drivers to its own driver.
   Hewlett-Packard (HP) Intellifont and Bitstream FaceLift do this.

   EGA Machines
   ------------

   On an EGA machine, the symptoms of this problem are not being able to start
   Windows and an error message asking for Setup to be run again.

   To correct this problem, run the Windows MS-DOS maintenance mode Setup to
   update the display driver.


   Bitstream FaceLift
   ------------------

   With Bitstream FaceLift, the symptoms of the display driver not being updated
   are (a) an aborted setup where you are dropped back into MS-DOS, or (b) after
   setup completes you attempt to restart and restart Windows, and you are
   dropped back into MS-DOS.

   To correct the problem:

   a. At the MS-DOS command prompt from outside Windows, change to your Windows
      directory.

      Type the following and then press ENTER:

   setup

   b. Select the Display option, and press ENTER.

   c. Choose your display type, then press ENTER.

   d. Press ENTER again, then press ESC. (This replaces the existing display
      driver.)

   e. Insert the correct Windows 3.1 disk, or change the drive and directory to
      point to the correct driver.

   f. Restart Windows.


 - Third-party fonts do not appear in the Installed Fonts list box in the Fonts
   option accessed from Control Panel.

   Third-party fonts will not appear here unless the font is installed using
   Control Panel, Fonts, Add. With Windows 3.0, this action is reserved for
   screen fonts. With Windows 3.1, TrueType fonts are installed this way. Most
   third-party font packages do not install in this way; therefore, it is
   unlikely you will see third-party fonts here.
