SUMMARY
=======

Pvtdlg.exe is a file in the Microsoft Download Center that demonstrates using a
private dialog-box class in an application. The PVTDLG application demonstrates
using a private dialog-box class by itself and in conjunction with another
dialog box procedure. PVTDLG registers a private dialog-box class that specifies
a number of additional window extra bytes. The sample stores the colors to paint
each window in the allocated space.

A private dialog-box class is a technique that allows one callback procedure to
process messages that are common to several different dialog boxes. The private
dialog-box class encapsulates code that would otherwise be repeated in each
dialog procedure.

When Windows has a message for a dialog box that is a member of a private
dialog-box class, it calls the private dialog-box class procedure. After the
private dialog-box class procedure completes its processing, it must call the
DefDlgProc function.

The next step depends on the contents of the lpDialogFunc parameter in the
application's call to the CreateDialog or DialogBox functions. If lpDialogFunc
is NULL, the DefDlgProc function performs its default processing for the message
and processing of that message is complete. If lpDialogFunc is not NULL,
DefDlgProc calls the specified procedure. If the dialog box procedure returns
FALSE, DefDlgProc performs its default processing for the message. If the dialog
box procedure returns any other value, DefDlgProc skips the default processing
and returns.
