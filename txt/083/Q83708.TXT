SUMMARY
=======

When changing the language setting in the International dialog box of the
Control Panel, the change is not reflected in the [intl] section of the WIN.INI.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The purpose of this setting is to specify the language you want to work in.
Windows applications that provide language-specific tasks, such as sorting or
spell-checking, use this setting. Following are the standard values:

   Value         Language
   -----         --------
   dan           Danish
   dut           Dutch
   eng           International English
   fcf           French Canadian
   fin           Finnish
   frn           French
   ger           German
   ice           Icelandic
   itn           Italian
   nor           Norwegian
   por           Portuguese
   spa           Spanish
   usa           U.S. English

To reflect the change made in the Control Panel, add the following line to the
[intl] section of the WIN.INI file:

   sLanguage=<string>

where string is the value for the specified language. For example, for Dutch you
would insert the following line:

   sLanguage=dut
