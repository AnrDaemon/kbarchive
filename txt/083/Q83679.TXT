MORE INFORMATION
================

Normal Installation
-------------------

1. Close any open applications, so only Windows 3.1 is running.

2. Insert the Microsoft TrueType Font Pack into drive A.

3. In Windows Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

4. In the Command Line box, type

   a:\setup

   and choose the OK button.

5. Follow the online instructions.

Manual Installation Because of Error
------------------------------------

When attempting to install the TrueType Font Pack, you may encounter the
following error message:

   DSHELL.DLL caused a General Protection Fault in module USER.EXE at segment
   XXXX:xxxx

To work around this error, the Font Pack can be installed manually:

1. Copy the EXPAND.EXE file from the Windows disk 3 (1.44MB and 1.2MB) into the
   WINDOWS directory.

2. Expand all the *.TT_ files into the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory from the
   original Windows disk 1 by typing the following:

   c:\windows\expand a:*.tt_ c:\windows\system

   Repeat for disk 2.

3. Rename all the *.TT_ files in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory to *.TTF by typing
   the following:

   rename *.tt_ *.ttf

4. Start Windows and run the Control Panel.

5. Choose Fonts and then the Add button.

6. Change to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

7. Choose the Select All button and then choose OK.

OLE Drag and Drop Installation
------------------------------

1. From File Manager double click the subdirectory that contains the .TTF or
   .TT_ files.

2. From Control Panel, run Fonts.

3. Return to File Manager and highlight the fonts you want to install.

4. Drag and drop the font selection on the Fonts dialog.

The files will be added and uncompressed if necessary.

Network Installation
--------------------

There are two ways to do a network install:

 - Allow all workstations access.

   -or-

 - Allow only one or more workstations to access the fonts.

All Workstations Have Access

NOTE: Make sure you are using a network license pack if multiple users will have
access to the TrueType Font Pack. Pricing and availability information is
available at the Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) by calling (800)
426-9400.

1. From one workstation, start Windows.

2. From the File menu, choose Run.

3. Type the following and press ENTER:

   a:setup

4. The Setup program expands all the files into the Windows shared directory on
   the server and updates the workstation's WIN.INI file for the fonts.

5. For other workstations to have access to these fonts, each user should do the
   following from his/her workstation:

   a. Run Control Panel, and choose the Fonts icon.

   b. Choose the Add button and select the Windows shared directory.

   c. Choose the Select All button, and then the OK button.

Note the following:

 - You may want to clear the Copy To The Windows Directory check box to have the
   *.TTF files remain on the server. Regardless of the box, the *.FOT files are
   copied into the user directory.

 - If you receive the following error messages, then you do not have full rights
   to the directory that contains the fonts:

   Cannot Change properties of the file named ".

   Setup program file has been modified or corrupted.

 - The following warning message is normal when using TrueType fonts from a
   network drive:

   The specified path points to a font file that may not be available during
   later Windows sessions.

One or More Workstations Have Access

1. Use Windows 3.1's EXPAND.EXE to decompress all the .TT_ files into a TTFONTS
   directory. (EXPAND.EXE is on disk 3 for 3.5-inch 1.44 MB and 5.25-inch 1.2 MB
   disks. The fonts are on disks 4 and 5 of the 3.5-inch 1.44 MB disks, and on
   disks 5 and 6 of the 5.25-inch 1.2 MB disks.)

   Type the following:

   c:\windows\expand a:\*.tt_ x:\ttfonts

2. Change to the X:\TTFONTS directory and rename all the *.TT_ files to *.TTF.

   rename *.tt_ *.ttf

3. Run Windows on the workstation.

4. Run Control Panel, and choose the Fonts icon.

5. Choose the Add button and select the TTFONTS directory.

6. Clear the Copy To Windows Directory check box.

7. Choose the Select All button, and then the OK button.

8. Repeat for other workstations that are licensed to use these fonts.

If you want to control access to the fonts, change the network rights needed to
get to the TTFONTS directory. Consult your network manual for the procedure.

You can also substitute your user directory or local hard drive instead of the
TTFONTS directory on the server.
