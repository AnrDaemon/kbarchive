TITLE   :PRB: No Files Copied Installing Windows SDK 3.1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the process of installing the Windows 3.1 Software Development Kit (SDK),
no files are copied to the destination hard disk.

CAUSE
=====

The hard disk does not have enough free space. Although the amount of hard disk
space required varies depending on the components installed, from 9.6 to 24.3
(MB) megabytes are required. The installation program requires 4 additional MB
for scratch space.

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete files to create free hard-disk space.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The disk space requirements may preclude installing version 3.1 of the Windows
SDK over a previous version of the Windows SDK. If so, delete the previous
version of the Windows SDK, then install the Windows SDK version 3.1.

For more information on installing the Windows SDK version 3.1, including an
article that provides the recommended installation procedure, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
