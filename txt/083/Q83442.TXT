SUMMARY
=======

The Quad VGA display driver does not have full functionality on some VGA cards,
such as the Quadram and Chips & Technologies cards, when used with Microsoft
Windows operating system version 3.1. You cannot use the MS-DOS Prompt in a
window. In addition, pressing ALT+TAB may result in a corrupted display. Windows
3.0 behaves similarly with these cards.

The VGA (Version 3.0) selection in the Display list box in Windows 3.1 Setup
offers the most functionality for these video cards. To access the Display list
box, choose the Windows Setup icon, and choose Change System Settings from the
Options menu.

Occasionally, you need to run the following command from the MS-DOS command
prompt before starting and/or after running Windows 3.1:

   MODE CO80

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Quadram video card was developed around 1988. It uses the C&T 441
chipset. Quadram, ATI, and C&T sold display cards with this chipset.

The Quadram video card uses the VGA driver with its own virtual display driver
(VDD) VDDCT441.386. This driver also shipped with Windows 3.0. It was kept in
Windows 3.1, but a new modified VGA driver was developed.
