SUMMARY
=======

When you upgrade from Windows version 3.0 to the Microsoft Windows operating
system version 3.1, the port selection of LPTx.OS2 (where x is the port number)
may not change. If an LPT port with the .OS2 extension is present in the [ports]
section of your WIN.INI file when you upgrade, this port extension of .OS2 does
not change to .DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 3.0 installs printer ports LPT1.OS2 and LPT2.OS2. Windows 3.1 installs
printer ports LPT1.DOS and LPT2.DOS. The .OS2 extension and the .DOS extension
function the same. This information applies to all LPT ports. For more
information, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   LPT1.OS2 print
