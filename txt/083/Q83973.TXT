SUMMARY
=======

When Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 is installed on an
EVEREX/AGI 286 model 3602A laptop, the icons and icon titles appear to be twice
the size of the same display under Windows 3.0. This happens with either the CGA
or EGA drivers.

There is no solution to this problem.

pixel resolution and dimensions of 211mm X 132mm (8.3 inches across by 5.2

being oversized.
