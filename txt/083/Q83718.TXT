TITLE   :Brother HL-8e Prints TrueType Incorrectly in Landscape
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Windows version 3.1, if you print TrueType fonts in landscape
orientation on some early versions of the Brother HL-8e printer, the text prints
incorrectly. This occurs with the universal printer driver (UNIDRV.DLL) version
3.1 and the Brother HL-8e mini-driver version 1.0. Portrait orientation is not
affected and prints TrueType fonts correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The Brother printers that do not print TrueType fonts correctly in landscape
mode have a ROM version dated between 10/27/1988 and 7/20/1989.

This problem occurs because some of the earlier versions of this printer are
Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet compatible; the current versions of the HL-8e are
HP LaserJet Series II compatible.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Run the Control Panel.

2. Choose the Printers icon.

3. Select the Brother HL-8e printer.

4. Choose the Setup button.

5. Choose the Options button.

6. Select the Print TrueType As Graphics check box.
