SUMMARY
=======

If the PATH statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file is longer than 127 characters,
the Windows 3.1 Custom setup will report the following message:

   Setup did not add the Windows directory to the PATH line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file because the PATH line would be longer than 127 characters.

   After setup, please delete unnecessary PATH information and then add the
   Windows directory

When OK is chosen, Setup displays a dialog box notifying you that your
AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files need to be modified.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This occurs because Setup checks the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files before
they are displayed, along with the proposed changes. If Setup cannot modify the
PATH because it is too long, the preceding error is returned. This allows for
modification of the PATH statement so the windows drivers can be loaded.
