======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you install Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 without upgrading
a Windows 3.0 installation, you will have the following two options for a Mouse
Systems mouse.

 - Mouse Systems serial mouse on COM2

 - Mouse Systems serial or bus mouse

If Windows does not recognize your mouse on COM1 and the Windows 3.0 disks are
available, you can install the earlier Windows 3.0 Mouse Systems driver written
for COM1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the Mouse Systems driver for COM1 from Windows 3.0, do the
following:

1. Edit either the SETUP.INF or the OEM0.INF file. Use a text editor or the
   Windows-based application Write (WRITE.EXE). If Write is used, be sure to
   Choose No Conversion when opening the file, so it will be saved as a text
   file when you exit.

2. Add the following two lines to the [Pointing.Device] section. These lines
   should appear in the .INF file as one line each, not word wrapped.

        msmouse3 = 1:msmouse1.drv,"Mouse Systems (or VisiOn) connected to
        COM1:", x:*vmd

        msmouse4 = 1:msmouse2.drv,"Mouse Systems (or VisiOn) connected to
        COM2:", x:*vmd

3. Copy the following two files to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory from the Windows
   3.0 disks:

   MSMOUSE1.DRV
   MSMOUSE2.DRV

4. Run the maintenance mode of Windows setup to install the Mouse Systems
   driver. (See chapter 15 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version
   3.1).
