SUMMARY
=======

Attempting to run Professional Oracle version 5.1 under Windows 3.0 and
Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 produces the error:

   No extended memory available

This error occurs because Oracle uses the INT15 extended memory allocation rather
than using the Microsoft eXtended Memory Specification (XMS). Oracle can be run
from Windows 3.0 only in real mode, with HIMEM.SYS version 2.60 removed from the
CONFIG.SYS file.

Professional Oracle will not run under Windows 3.1.

For Oracle to work properly under Windows 3.0 with the HIMEM.SYS file loaded,
Oracle must be modified to use XMS memory allocation rather than using Int15.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With MS-DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1, HIMEM.SYS includes an /INT15 switch. This
switch is not available with previous versions of MS-DOS or Windows. The device
line in CONFIG.SYS should read as follows

       Device=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS /INT15=XXX

where XXX represents the amount of extended memory in kilobytes not to be
converted to XMS.

Valid ranges for XXX are 64 through 65535.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.00a 3.0a DOS 5 Himem Switch
