SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Productivity Pack version 1.0 was designed specifically for
Microsoft Windows version 3.0. To run the Productivity Pack with the Microsoft
Windows operating system version 3.1, you need to obtain the updated version
designed for Windows 3.1; otherwise, you may experience compatibility problems.
In addition, much of the information in Learning Windows is irrelevant in
Windows 3.1 because of the extensive changes in this version of Windows.

For information about obtaining the updated Microsoft Productivity Pack, contact
your software vendor or call Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) at (800)
426-9400. If you are outside the United States, contact the Microsoft subsidiary
for your area.


MORE INFORMATION
================

You may experience the following problems if you run Productivity Pack version
1.0 in Windows 3.1:

 - Interactive sessions may generate a message that implies you did not follow
   the steps correctly, even if you follow the steps exactly. The box that
   contains this message overlaps the OK button; therefore, the only available
   option is to exit that section by pressing CTRL+F1.

 - When you run lesson 2, "Getting Help," from the Learning Windows portion of
   Productivity Pack 1.0, the program starts, proceeds through the demonstration
   of the help system, and generates the following error message:

   Help topic does not exist!

   If you attempt to recover from this message by choosing the OK button and
   pressing the SPACEBAR to continue, the system hangs.
