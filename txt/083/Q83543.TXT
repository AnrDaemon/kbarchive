SUMMARY
=======

Windows 3.1 supports four new functions and one new message that enable an
application to implement the drag-drop protocol. DragDrop.exe is a sample that
demonstrates how to use all four functions and the message. When the user drags
and drops a file onto Dragdrop.exe, the name of the file is added to a list box
in Dragdrop.exe

An application that can accept files dragged from the File Manager calls the
DragAcceptFiles function specifying one or more of its windows. When the user
drags a file from the File Manager into the window specified in the
DragAcceptFiles call, and releases the left mouse button, File Manager sends the
application a WM_DROPFILES message. (File Manager sends a WM_DROPFILES message
only to applications that have registered a window with DragAcceptFiles.)

One of the parameters to WM_DROPFILES contains a handle to an internal data
structure. The DragQueryFile function retrieves a number of dropped files and
their names from the data structure and returns this information to the
application. Likewise, DragQueryPoint retrieves the position of the mouse cursor
when the file(s) was dropped.

To release the memory allocated by Windows for the WM_DROPFILES data structure,
the application must call the DragFinish function after it retrieves the
applicable data.
