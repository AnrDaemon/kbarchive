SUMMARY
=======

The ENTER key on the numeric keypad cannot be used to toggle MS-DOS-based
applications between running in full-screen and window modes in Microsoft
Windows operating system version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To toggle an application from full-screen and window modes, hold down the ALT
key and press the keyboard's standard ENTER key (ALT+ENTER). This is only
possible when running Windows in 386 enhanced mode.

Windows 3.1 does not recognize the scan code of the extended ENTER key on the
numeric keypad as valid for the ALT+ENTER key combination.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 ALT ENTER windowed
