SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 may hang during startup on
Emerson 286 and 386sx computers with Quadtel HT113 286 or 386sx BIOS version
3.05.08, ROM version 1.04, dated prior to December 1990.

To correct the problem, contact Emerson for a BIOS upgrade.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs because the BIOS startup code places a non-zero value that
does not point to an interrupt service routine in the INT 5Ch vector. As a
result, when standard mode starts up and calls INT 5Ch to try to detect the
presence of NetBIOS, the machine hangs. If a NetBIOS network in installed on the
system, the problem does not occur.
