SUMMARY
=======

If you do not have a sound driver installed and you try to activate an embedded
sound object, Windows 3.1 displays a misleading error message. The message says
that the device is being used by another application instead of saying that no
device is installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You receive the following error message if you try to activate an embedded sound
object from an object-linking-and-embedding (OLE) client document (for example,
Microsoft Windows Write) and no sound driver is installed:

   This device is being used by another application. Either interrupt this
   application or wait until the device is free and then try again.

If this message appears, run the Sound Recorder. A more accurate error message
will display as follows:

   Sound Recorder cannot record or play back because a sound driver is not
   installed. Use the Driver option in Control Panel to install a driver.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 wave
