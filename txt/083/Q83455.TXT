TITLE   :PRB: XMS Version Information in MS-DOS Window Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In an MS-DOS window under Windows, the version number of the extended memory
system (XMS) driver is not the installed XMS driver (started before Windows is
started). It is a version of the XMS manager built into Windows. The same thing
is true for the expanded memory system (EMS) driver, the DOS Protected Mode
Interface (DPMI), and any other drivers that enhanced mode Windows virtualizes.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. When Windows starts, it takes over all the XMS memory from
the original XMS, EMS, and DPMI drivers. When you open an MS-DOS box, Windows
provides extended memory to the MS-DOS-based application. NOTE: The XMS manager
is XMS 2.0 compliant.

RESOLUTION
==========

It is not possible to retrieve the version number of the original provider.

Additional query words: 3.10
