SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to copy or cut a bitmap image from Windows version 3.1
Paintbrush, and paste it into CorelDRAW!, the screen may flicker, but the image
never appears. This problem only occurs under Windows 3.1 when pasting from
Paintbrush, not when pasting from other applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using CorelDRAW! version 2.001 or later, Corel Corporation recommends
the following workaround:

1. Save the Windows Paintbrush image as a .BMP file.

2. Start CorelDRAW!.

3. From the File menu, choose Import to import the .BMP image.

The CorelDRAW! .BMP import filter should import the image properly.

Note: Versions of CorelDRAW! earlier than version 2.001 do not have the .BMP
import option. Contact Corel Corporation for a possible upgrade.

Corel Corporation has confirmed this to be problem with CorelDRAW! when running
under Windows 3.1 and will provide an upgrade option to registered users of
earlier versions of their product.
