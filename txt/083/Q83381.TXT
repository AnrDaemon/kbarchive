======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 is started up, the following
error message may appear:

   Startup Application Error
   Application requested abnormal termination

After this message is displayed, the only available option may be to exit
Windows.

This error message may indicate an incompatible utility installed on the RUN= or
LOAD= line of the WIN.INI file or a damaged StartUp group file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Startup Application Error" may be caused by the following problems:

 - A program or terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program that is unable to
   execute properly may be listed on the LOAD= or RUN= line in the WIN.INI file.

 - The StartUp group may be damaged or an application loaded in this group may
   be corrupted.

To correct this problem, disable the LOAD= and RUN= lines in the WIN.INI file by
placing a semicolon (;) at the beginning of each line.

If the StartUp group is causing the problem, disable the STARTUP.GRP entry in the
PROGMAN.INI file or hold down the SHIFT key while starting Windows to disable
the StartUp group for that Windows session.
