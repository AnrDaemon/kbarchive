The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Under the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 Setup program, when the MS-DOS section
of Setup is completed, Setup starts Windows in standard mode. Standard mode is
executed to complete the graphical portion of the setup process. While trying to
enter standard mode, Windows may fail to start. The Setup program will then stop
responding (hang).

This article covers some reasons Setup may fail to start standard-mode Windows.

Reasons Windows 3.1 Setup May Fail to Start Standard-Mode Windows
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Incorrect hardware options may have been selected. Run a custom setup and
   ensure the descriptions of hardware and software in the System Information
   screen match the system.

2. The standard-mode (protected-mode) memory manager DOSX.EXE is incompatible
   with an expanded-memory-specification (EMS) or upper-memory-block (UMB)
   provider. Remove any EMS or UMB provider.

3. An incorrect display driver may have been selected. The BOOTLOG.TXT file
   should indicate that the display driver failed its initialization. Windows
   may succeed in starting, but then show a jumbled display. This sometimes
   indicates that the driver is working properly, but that the monitor cannot
   synchronize to the vertical/horizontal scan rates required for that
   particular display mode.

4. Check for the existence of the following three files in the Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory:

    - SETUP.EXE

    - WIN.INI

    - SYSTEM.INI.

   If any of these files exist in the SYSTEM subdirectory, they should be
   deleted.
