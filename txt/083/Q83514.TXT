======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message after you upgrade your Microsoft
Windows installation:

   Inadequate DPMI server

CAUSE
=====

This error can be caused by one of the following:

 - A failed upgrade attempt from Windows 3.0 to Windows version 3.1 or to
   Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 or 3.11, or a combination of Windows 3.0
   and 3.1 files in the same directory.

   This error message is displayed when KRNL386.EXE and WIN386.EXE are mismatched
   (one from Windows 3.0 and the other from Windows 3.1). This can happen if
   KRNL386.EXE is expanded into the Windows\SYSTEM directory during
   installation, but WIN386.EXE is not.

 - An incorrect memory configuration. An example of an incorrect memory
   configuration would be a machine that does not have the correct value
   specified for the RAM installed.

 - A third party 32-Bit Disk Access driver that conflicts with 32-Bit File
   Access. To work around this problem either disable 32-Bit Disk Access or
   32-Bit File Access.
