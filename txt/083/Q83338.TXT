SUMMARY
=======

Downloading TrueType fonts as PCL fonts to Hewlett-Packard (HP) printers
developed prior to the LaserJet Series II printers is not supported in Microsoft
Windows version 3.1. Such printers include the original HP LaserJet, the HP
LaserJet Plus, and the HP LaserJet 500+. On these printers, True Type fonts are
printed as raster graphics.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The HP LaserJet Series II printers and subsequent HP printers, including the HP
LaserJet III family, can either download TrueType fonts or print them as raster
graphics. This ability is controlled by the Print TrueType As Graphics check box
in the printer driver's Options dialog box. Downloading TrueType fonts is the
default selection. This results in the quickest printing times because less data
must be sent to the printer.

The HP products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
