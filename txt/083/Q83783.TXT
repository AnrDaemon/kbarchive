The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows version 3.1 and Windows with Multimedia Extensions version 1.0 have a
sound icon in the Control Panel. This icon allows sounds to be assigned to
several functions. To add additional sounds, you can either program or purchase
a software package designed specifically for this functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 3.1 has the following development functions to which sounds (files with
a .WAV extension) can be assigned. This information is listed in the WIN.INI
file, but you cannot add additional sound functions without the underlying
programming support. The following example demonstrates how the [Sounds] section
of the WIN.INI file should appear to provide the underlying programming
support:

      [Sounds]
      SystemAsterisk=C:\W31\CHORD.WAV,Asterisk
      SystemHand=chord.wav,Critical Stop
      SystemDefault=ding.wav,Default Beep
      SystemExclamation=chord.wav,Exclamation
      SystemQuestion=chord.wav,Question
      SystemExit=chimes.wav,Windows Exit
      SystemStart=C:\W31\CHIMES.WAV,Windows Start

All of these functions are defined by the Windows multimedia MessageBeep
function. You can add additional sound functions with the sndPlaySound function,
provided you are programming Windows applications with the Microsoft Multimedia
Development Kit.
