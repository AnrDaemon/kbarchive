SUMMARY
=======

The 16.66 characters-per-inch (cpi) Line Printer font is available to
Windows-based applications that use the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet IIIsi and
related drivers. Some Windows-based applications may list the size of this font
as 8 points instead of 8.5 points. Nevertheless, selecting the Line Printer
font, regardless of the listed size, ensures that the driver uses the 16.66 cpi
font.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 8.5 point font (16.66 cpi Line Printer font) is an HP-printer internal font,
and is available in this one size only. Note that the Line Printer font is not
available when using the HP LaserJet IIISi PostScript driver.
