SUMMARY
=======

When you use File Manager to print from Microsoft Windows version 3.1, various
error messages may occur if you are using accessory applications packaged with
Windows versions 2.x, 3.0, or 3.0a (such as Calculator, Write, and so on).
Errors are produced if you print with File Manager using either the FILE option
or by dragging the filename and dropping it on the Print Manager desktop or
minimized icon.

MORE INFORMATION
================

File Manager uses the information stored in the registration database to both
open and print files. The registration information editor provides information
on how an application prints. The following Windows 3.1 applications contain
printing method information in the registration database and use the /p option
to print:

   Calendar
   Cardfile
   Notepad
   Paintbrush
   Write

Earlier versions of these Windows accessory applications do not use the /p
switch, and therefore produce error messages or will not print when attempting
to use File Manager to print. Install or use the Windows 3.1 programs to correct
the problem. For example, when you print a text file in Windows 3.1 with the
Windows 3.0 Notepad, the following message occurs:

   

   /P <filename> not found;
   create a new file?
   Yes       No
