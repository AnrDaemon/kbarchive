SUMMARY
=======

Double-clicking your mouse in the Microsoft Windows may perform like a single
click if the mouse Double Click Speed is set too high.

To eliminate this problem, reduce the double click speed within the Mouse section
of the Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the mouse Double Click Speed setting in the Mouse section of the Windows
Control Panel is set to the fastest setting, clicking the mouse button may act
like a single click instead of a double click.

To correct this problem, reduce the mouse Double Click Speed.

Steps to change the mouse Double Click Speed:

1. In the Windows Main group, select the Control Panel icon.

2. In the Control Panel, choose the Mouse icon.

3. Use the scroll bar to reduce the mouse Double Click Speed.

Until the mouse Double Click Speed is changed, it may be necessary to use the
keyboard. For more information on using Windows keyboard commands, refer to the
"Microsoft Windows User's Guide" or Windows online Help.
