SUMMARY
=======

MDIRest.exe is a sample that demonstrates how to use GetWindowPlacement() to
save the state of all windows in a multiple document interface (MDI) application
when the application shuts down. When the user runs the application a second
time, SetWindowPlacement() uses the stored information to restore the state of
the windows.

Many applications available today allow the user to store the size and position
of the application's main window in an initialization file. The next time the
user runs the application, the stored size and position information is used to
create the main window. The Windows File Manager and Program Manager are
examples of applications that save and restore size and position information.

Under Windows 3.0, many operations are required to retrieve the normal size and
position for a window if it is maximized or minimized. Under Windows 3.1, the
GetWindowPlacement() function has been provided to perform this task.
GetWindowPlacement() provides the size and position of a restored window at all
times, even when the window is minimized or maximized. The SetWindowPlacement()
function allows an application to change its restored size and position at all
times.

The GetWindowPlacement() function stores the following information regarding a
specified window into a WINDOWPLACEMENT structure:

 - Its current state (maximized, minimized or normal).

 - Its maximized position.

 - Its minimized position.

 - The rectangle that the window occupies in its normal position.

The SetWindowPlacement() function restores a specified window to the state
described by a WINDOWPLACEMENT structure.
