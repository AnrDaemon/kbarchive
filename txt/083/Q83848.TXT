-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information applies to upgrading a network installation of
Microsoft Windows 3.0 to Windows version 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups (WFWG)
version 3.1 or 3.11.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the SETUP /N command to upgrade a Windows 3.0 installation to a
shared network installation of Windows 3.1 or WFWG, the original installation of
Windows 3.0 must be a shared copy of Windows (that is, the earlier SETUP command
was executed with the /N switch).

If you use SETUP /N to upgrade a Full (local, or not shared) installation of
Windows to a Network Shared installation, the following errors occur when
Windows is started in 386 enhanced mode: :

   Cannot find a device file that may be needed to run Windows in 386 enhanced
   mode; run Setup again. INT13

-or-

   Cannot find a device file that may be needed to run Windows in 386 enhanced
   mode; run Setup again. WDCTRL

-or-

   Cannot find a device file that may be needed to run Windows in 386 enhanced
   mode; run setup again. VTDAPI.386

Windows displays these error messages because the SYSTEM.INI file has been
updated and is expecting to find an updated WIN386.EXE file in the
Windows\SYSTEM subdirectory. Because SETUP /N does not create a Windows\SYSTEM
subdirectory, Windows cannot find these files.

If Windows is started in standard mode, Windows displays the following error
message and return to the MS-DOS command prompt:

   Executable Not Found
