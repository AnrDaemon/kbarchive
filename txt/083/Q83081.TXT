SUMMARY
=======

In these products, the cout class uses a buffering system for data that may not
be flushed immediately. Because cout usually handles small messages, several
messages are usually needed to fill the buffer, which will cause the data to be
written to the standard output handle. In some cases, this can cause
considerable delay when writing output to the screen during a debugging session.
This problem can be avoided, however, by using the endl manipulator. When
appended to the end of a cout call, the endl manipulator inserts a newline
character and then flushes the buffer.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed: none
   */ 

   #include <iostream.h>

   void main(void)
   {
     cout << "This string will be buffered";
     cout << "This string will be flushed immediately" <<endl;
   }

For more information on the other methods to flush the cout buffer, please see
