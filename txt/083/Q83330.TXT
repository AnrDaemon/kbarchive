SUMMARY
=======

When using Hewlett-Packard (HP) NewWave version 3.0 or earlier with Microsoft
Windows operating system version 3.1, you will receive the following error
message:

   System error: Incorrect System version: reinstall 386 using Setup.

HP NewWave is invoked with a batch file that detects the version of the Windows
video drivers being used. It does not copy the correct video drivers.

This problem does not occur with HP NewWave version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

HP technical support suggests editing the "NewWave batch file" and deleting
everything from the beginning of the file to the line that says:

   :std

This will skip the version detection portion of the batch file. WARNING: This
workaround might cause some problems concerning driver versions with some
applications.

Alternatively, you can replace the display driver and video grabber by replacing
the existing Display= line in the [386 Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file
with:

      Display=VDDVGA30.386

In addition, you will need to replace the existing 386Grabber= line in the [boot]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file with:

      386Grabber=VGA30.3GR

For additonal information on HP NewWave, please contact Hewlett-Packard.
