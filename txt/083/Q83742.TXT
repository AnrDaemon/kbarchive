The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you install Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, running
Autocad 11 and Autocad 386 generates the following error message when run
outside of Windows if SMARTDrive (SMARTDRV.EXE) version 4.0 is loaded

   Use vdisk switch signature at address xxxxxh

where xxxxxh is the address.

To correct this problem, use the NewDX program that ships with Autocad to avoid
conflicting with SMARTDrive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NewDX is in compressed format. When it is run, it decompresses itself and
supplies the necessary files and Help document. NewDX determines where Autocad
starts using extended memory.

Example: If you have 8 MB of RAM and 2 MB of it is being used by SMARTDrive, then
you should tell NewDX to start using extended memory above where SMARTDrive is
active.
