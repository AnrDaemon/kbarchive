TITLE   :Audio CD Stops or Skips When Common Dialog Boxes Are Activated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

If the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 common dialog boxes
(COMMDLG.DLL) are used while playing audio CDs, the sound may phase in and out
or skip.

These problems have been traced to the ASWCDSNY.SYS driver. Replacing it with the
TSLCDR.SYS driver corrects these problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if you choose Open from the File menu (which displays a common
dialog box) while playing an audio CD, the CD will either stop playing or skip a
track.

Other random problems may occur while using the ASWCDSNY.SYS driver. Other
drivers may display similar problems.
