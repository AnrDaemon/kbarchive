SUMMARY
=======

Versions 1.1.2 and 3.0 of the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks Gateway to
Fax can be run on a Mail for AppleTalk Networks server that has other gateways
installed. If the other gateways require use of a data modem and the printer
port is being used for a network connection, you must use a combination fax/data
modem. Fax gateway is configured to use the modem port.

If fax gateway is in Send mode, it will only attempt to use the modem port to
send a fax and then release the modem port for other gateways to use.

When running fax gateway in Receive mode, the Gateway Connect Times screen should
have the Pause box checked if other gateway(s) need to use the modem attached to
the modem port. This will cause fax gateway to release the modem port once every
2 hours so that the other gateway(s) will be able to use the modem port. Also,
all incoming calls will be answered by fax gateway, unless you configure the
Gateway Connect Times so that each gateway's access to the modem does not
overlap with another gateway. This is because BackRas may independently schedule
the FaxInit to look for incoming calls.
