The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a system with a WACOM tablet installed, hypertext context jumps and
glossary entries do not appear on the screen.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because the default color for the hypertext keywords is light green,
and the recommended settings for using Microsoft Windows with the WACOM tablet
disable the green video signal.

WORKAROUND
==========

Two settings in the WIN.INI file allow you to specify a different color for the
hypertext keywords. Use the following procedure to change these settings.

NOTE: You may find this procedure helpful if you wish to change the hypertext
color just because you find the green text difficult to read.

1. Use a text editor to modify the WIN.INI file.

2. Find the [Windows Help] section.

3. Add two lines that resemble the following:

         JUMPCOLOR=(255,0,0)
         POPUPCOLOR=(255,0,0)

This changes the hypertext keywords to red. The value to the right of the equal
sign represents a red, green, blue (RGB) color-value triple. While any color may
be specified (because the green signal is disabled), changing the green
parameter makes no difference in the color selected.
