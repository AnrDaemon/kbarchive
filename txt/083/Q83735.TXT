======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Express Setup is used to upgrade Microsoft Windows 3.0a to Microsoft
Windows 3.1 or 3.11 on a system with a Logitech mouse, the LMOUSE.DRV file and
the virtual driver file LVMD.386 are not installed.

This article describes the procedure for installing these drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install these drivers:

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, copy EXPAND.EXE from Disk 3 of the Windows
   setup disks to the root directory on drive C. For example, if disk 3 is in
   drive A, you would type the following and press ENTER:

   copy a:expand.exe c:\

2. Delete the LMOUSE.DRV file in the Windows\SYSTEM subdirectory. To do this,
   use the MS-DOS CD command to change to the Windows\SYSTEM subdirectory, then
   issue the MS-DOS DEL command. The following is an example (press ENTER at the
   end of each line):

         cd\windows\system
         del lmouse.drv

3. If you are using 1.2 MB or 1.44 MB Windows setup disks, insert Disk 2. If you
   are using 720K disks insert Disk 4.

4. Type the following commands (press ENTER at the end of each line):

   expand a:lmouse.dr_ c:\windows\system\lmouse.drv

   expand a:lvmd.38_ c:\windows\system\lvmd.386

5. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file with a standard ASCII text editor (such as Notepad
   or the Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0 Editor) and make sure the following two
   lines exist under the correct section header.

   The following line should already exist:

         [boot]
         MOUSE.DRV=LMOUSE.DRV

   The following line replaces MOUSE=*VMD:

         [386Enh]
         MOUSE=LVMD.386

NOTE: If you run Setup from inside of Windows to switch from any available mouse
selection and switch to Logitech Mouse, then LMOUSE.DRV and LVMD.386 are copied
to your system from the Windows disks. LMOUSE.COM is not copied. LMOUSE.COM is
necessary for mouse support for non-Windows-based applications and should be
loaded before starting Windows.

Use the following command line to expand LMOUSE.COM from the Windows disks:

   expand a:\lmouse.co_ c:\windows\lmouse.com
