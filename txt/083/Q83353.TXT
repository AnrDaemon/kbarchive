SUMMARY
=======

While installing a printer driver in the Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.0 or 3.1 through the Control Panel, the Printers dialog box appears as
follows if you installed Windows from a different set of disks:

   INSERT Microsoft Windows 3.00 DISK # OR A DISK WITH THE
   UPDATED (DRIVER) IN drive A:

This dialog box keeps repeating after you insert the disk and choose the OK
button.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you installed Windows with 5.35-inch disks, Windows prompts you for the
5.25-inch disk that contains the appropriate printer driver. If you insert a
3.5-inch disk in the disk drive and press the OK button, Windows cannot find the
appropriate printer driver if it is not contained on the disk. Pressing the OK
button causes this dialog box to reappear.


To work around this problem, use the following steps:

1. Obtain the same size disks that Windows was originally installed with, and
   insert the requested disk. When prompted, press the OK button to complete the
   driver installation.

2. Search the disks for the requested printer driver. When the requested file is
   found, insert the disk in the drive containing the driver, and press the OK
   button.
