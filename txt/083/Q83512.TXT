The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you upgrade to Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 from an
existing version of Windows 3.0 that is using a third-party communications
driver, Windows 3.1 Setup does not update the COMM.DRV= line in the [boot]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Windows 3.0 is using a third-party communications driver to replace
Microsoft's COMM.DRV and it has a different filename, Windows 3.1 will not
update the COMM.DRV= line in the [boot] section of SYSTEM.INI and will not copy
the Windows 3.1 COMM.DRV file into the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. This behavior
occurs so that Windows 3.1 can be compatible with Windows 3.0 communications
programs that ship with their own COMM drivers.

To use a third-party driver, it is necessary to add the following line to the
[386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI:

   COMMDRV30=TRUE

If the Windows 3.0 application still does not function in Windows 3.1, manually
install the Windows 3.1 COMM.DRV file as follows:

1. Expand COMM.DR_ in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. (COMM.DR_ is found on Disk
   2 in the 5.25-inch format and Disk 1 in the 3.5-inch format.)

2. Rename COMM.DR_ to COMM.DRV.

3. Edit the [boot] section of SYSTEM.INI by changing the COMM.DRV= line to the
   following:

   COMM.DRV=COMM.DRV
