SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to print from Aldus PhotoStyler in Microsoft Windows operating
system version 3.1, a general protection (GP) fault occurs in UNIDRV.DLL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in UNIDRV.DLL shipped with Windows
version 3.1.

The only way to accurately determine which version of UNIDRV.DLL is being used is
to use MSD.EXE to examine the file version stamps. The original UNIDRV.DLL from
the 3.1 box is version 3.10.0.103. Versions stamped 3.10.0.104 or later correct
this problem. Both versions of UNIDRV.DLL display 3.1 in the drivers About
dialog box.

Additional query words: printer photo styler 3.10 UNIDRV.EXE
