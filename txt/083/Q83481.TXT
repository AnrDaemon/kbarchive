-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When installing the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, the
following error message may appear if MS-DOS Shell is resident in memory and the
Task Swapper option is enabled:

   You are attempting to run Setup from within Windows. You need to quit
   Windows, and then run Setup from the MS-DOS command prompt. Press F3 to quit
   Setup.

To prevent this error message, close Shell before installing Windows 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To correct this problem, use the following steps:

1. Press F3 to exit Windows Setup.

2. Type "exit" (without the quotation marks), and press ENTER. (This returns you
   to Shell.)

3. Press ALT+F4 to close Shell and exit to the MS-DOS command prompt.

4. Run Windows Setup.

If you run SETUP.EXE from within Shell with Task Swapper enabled, the
aforementioned error message may occur, or your system may hang. Setup may run
without error in conjunction with the Shell if Task Swapper is disabled;
however, it may cause problems, depending on other MS-DOS Environment Settings.

Microsoft does not recommend running Windows Setup from MS-DOS Shell or any type
of menu or shell program.
