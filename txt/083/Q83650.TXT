SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, some Windows-based
applications will not update an OLE object when Paintbrush sends an update
command using the File menu's Update command. This may also happen with other
OLE servers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows-based applications that were produced before Windows 3.1 may not be able
to process the OLE_CHANGE command that is sent out when the Update command is
chosen.
