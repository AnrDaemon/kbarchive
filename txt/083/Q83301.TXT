SUMMARY
=======

Under Windows version 3.1, the value returned by an MS-DOS-based application is
available to other applications in the system. Under Windows version 3.0,
however, this value is not available; the exit code returned is always zero.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows supports an MS-DOS window in which to run MS-DOS (non-Windows)
applications. The WINOLDAP module serves as an interface for the application and
the remainder of the Windows environment. When the MS-DOS-based application
terminates, WINOLDAP retrieves the application's exit code. Then WINOLDAP itself
terminates, using the retrieved exit code as its own exit code.

An application developed for the Windows environment can retrieve the exit code
from WINOLDAP. The application defines a call-back function and calls the
NotifyRegister function in the tool helper library (TOOLHELP.DLL). The call-back
function will receive an NFY_EXITTASK message containing the exit code each time
a task terminates.

The Windows 3.1 WINOLDAP module can return a number of error codes which are
listed and explained in the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
Programmer's Reference Volume 1," page 277.
