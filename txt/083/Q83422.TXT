The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you choose Connect from the Printers option in Control Panel, COM3 is
detected as a local port even when there is not a physical COM3 port present.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Choosing the Connect button displays the list of available ports with a
description of the ports' usage. The descriptions will be one of the following:

1. Network Connection: This displays the current network printer connection for
   that port.

2. Local Port: This option is reported if Windows detects that the physical port
   exists.

3. Local Port Not Present: This option is reported if Windows does not detect
   the port or if the port is currently being used by another device such as a
   mouse or modem.

For COM3, Windows will use the default address of 3E8H for COM3 even though the
port is not physically present. Because this default address is used, the port
is always recognized as a local port.
