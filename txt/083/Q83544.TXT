======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to add additional printers to Windows, you receive the following
message:

   The information file is damaged or not in the system directory. Copy the
   control.inf file from disk #1 ...

RESOLUTION
==========

 - Delete all *.INF (information) files from the Windows directory. NOTE: Do not
   delete any *.INF files from the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

   This error occurs if the *.INF files were placed in the Windows directory
   erroneously. This could occur due to user error, or third- party installation
   programs.

 - Re-creating the WIN.INI file may also help correct this error. For more
   information about rebuilding the WIN.INI file, query on the following words
   in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   create and win.ini and without and third-party

 - Open the SYSTEM.INI file in a text editor (such as Windows Notepad) and add a
   semicolon preceding the Device=SYMEVNT.386 line to disable it:

   ;Device=SYMEVNT.386   ;Added By NU8

   Restart Windows to make this change take effect. Disabling this statement does
   not allow Norton Utilities to run properly while in Windows.

   NOTE: SYMEVNT.386 is a device driver provided with Norton Utilities and Norton
   AntiVirus. Symantec has released a new version of this file that may correct
   this error. Download file NU8DRV.EXE from the Symantec bulletin board service
   (BBS).
