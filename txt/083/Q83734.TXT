SUMMARY
=======

The HIMEM.SYS file in the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 may not
select the correct A20 handler when loading on a Hewlett-Packard (HP) Vectra
QS/20. This causes the machine to run slower in Windows 3.1 than in Windows 3.0.
To correct this problem, do the following:

 - Edit the CONFIG.SYS file with a standard ASCII text editor. Modify the
   HIMEM.SYS line as follows:

   device=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS /M:14

Note: It is always a good idea to have a system startup floppy disk whenever you
modify the HIMEM.SYS file.

Additional query words: 3.10
