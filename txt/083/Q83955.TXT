The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you print a file with TrueType fonts from Microsoft Windows 3.1 to a Sanyo
Blazer Star II laser printer, the printout may be missing characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, you must upgrade the printer's ROM chips to version
1.3. To obtain this upgrade, contact Sanyo and ask for the Blazer parts
department.

To determine what ROM version you have, do a self test on the printer. The test
page lists the version.

You may be able to work around this problem by opening Control Panel, Printers;
turning off Print Manager, clicking on Connect and choosing "Lpt1.dos or
Lpt1.os2" as the output port; and, finally, deactivating Fast Print Direct to
Port. This, effectively, limits Windows printing to only 9 pins, bypassing the
ROM problem.
