Corrected Section 2.21
----------------------

To print from any mode of Windows across LANtastic 3.x or 4.x, it is necessary to
do one of the following:

Turn off the Fast Printing Direct To Port option in Control Panel. To do this,
choose the Printers option in Control Panel, and then choose the Connect button.
Clear the Fast Printing Direct To Port check box. When you turn off this option,
it affects all of your ports.

If you want to turn this option off for one port only, follow these steps:

1. If you are printing using LPT3, add the following entry to the [ports]
   section of the WIN.INI file:

         LPT3.DOS=

   If you are using LPT1 or LPT2, you can use the LPT1.DOS or LPT2.DOS entries
   already in your WIN.INI file.

2. Quit Windows, and then redirect the LPTx.DOS port (where x is the port you
   are using) by using the LANtastic net use command.

3. Restart Windows.

4. Using Control Panel, change your printer port to LPTx.DOS.

If you are running LANtastic version 3.x, you cannot run Windows in 386 enhanced
mode on a non-dedicated server.

If you have a network connection on LPT1, it will not be displayed in Print
Manager or Control Panel.
