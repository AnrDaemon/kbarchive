-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

This article describes circumstances in which the Microsoft Windows File menu
Print command is unavailable in Windows-based applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 3.0
-----------

In Microsoft Windows version 3.0, the File menu's Print command is unavailable
(dimmed) in Windows-based applications under the following circumstances.:

 - No printer driver is installed.

 - No default printer is selected.

 - The default printer is connected to "None."

 - There is no valid Set Temp setting in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

You can verify the printer setup by choosing the Printers icon in the Control
Panel and checking for the printer and the port, and you can determine if there
is a default printer selected.

To select a default printer, double-click the printer you want to be the default
printer from the list of printers in the Installed Printers box. If the printer
you choose is connected to None, choose Configure and select a port other than
None.

Be sure there is a valid Set Temp setting in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. It should
point to a valid directory and must have no trailing spaces.

Windows 3.1
-----------

In Windows 3.1, you also need a printer driver installed, and a default printer
selected. To verify the printer setup:

1. Run Control Panel and Printers.

2. Check for an installed printer driver.

In the Printers option there is a Set Default Printer button that enables you to
choose your default printer. Windows 3.1 also automatically sets up a default
printer when a printer driver is installed.

Having a printer drive on the "None" port is normally not an issue with Windows
3.1 because it does not have a "None" port setting. However, if Windows 3.1 is
installed over Windows 3.0 and a printer was configured for None, Windows will
keep the None as the configuration. If this is the case:

1. Run Control Panel and Printers.

2. Highlight the printer driver and choose Connect and choose another port.

In Windows 3.1, if a valid Set Temp setting is not found, a default of the
Windows directory is used.
