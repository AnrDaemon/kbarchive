The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.x, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks Gateway to Fax and System
6.0x, free System heap memory (the memory allocated to the System) on the server
may cause some problems. If the heap does not provide enough extra memory for
the BackRas INIT to convert a document to fax format, error messages will be
sent to the Network Manager and the document will be returned to the sender.

Error number -108, -3005, -3019 or -3020 may be generated, but each error
indicates the same problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you use a heap sizing utility, the System heap memory can be expanded to
allow rasterization to be completed. In general, the more System memory
available, the faster a document can be rasterized. Some common heap utilities
are HeapFixer, HeapTool and BootMan.

Increasing the amount of memory allotted to Mail for AppleTalk Networks does not
correct this problem.
