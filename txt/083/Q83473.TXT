The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows 3.1 comes with a file called TESTPS.TXT. This file is brought
into the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory if you install a PostScript printer.

On page 30, Chart 4.1, the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide
incorrectly states that TESTPS.TXT is copied into the \WINDOWS directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

TESTPS.TXT is used to test PostScript printers for connection and functionality
problems. To use TESTPS.TXT, copy it to the port to which the PostScript printer
is connected as follows:

   COPY C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\TESTPS.TXT LPTx

   -or-

   COPY C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\TESTPS.TXT COMx

where "x" is the port number

If the printer is functioning correctly, a page is ejected with the following
information:

   Max Printer VM (KB):            xxx.x
   Max Suggested VM (KB):          xxx.x
   Bit Rate:                      19.2 kilobits per second (Kbps) or less
   Data Bits:                      7
   Parity:                         None
   Stop Bits:                      1
   Flow Control:                   Hardware

If the printer is not functioning or is not connected properly, no page is
ejected.

If no output occurs, check the following:

1. Is the printer plugged in? Is the power on? Try turning off the power and
   turning it back on again.

2. Is there paper in the printer?

3. Is the correct port being used to copy TESTPS.TXT? Try copying the file to
   other available ports.

4. Is the printer cable functioning properly? Try a different cable.

5. Is the LPT or Serial card/port configured correctly? Check the BIOS table at
   40:0 for proper addresses. Check the DIP switches or software setup for the
   card.

6. Are the settings in the Ports window of the Control Panel configured
   according to the TESTPS.TXT output? To verify this, use the following steps:

   a. Open the Control Panel, and double-click the Ports icon.

   b. Select the active port, then choose the Settings button.

   c. Compare the settings with the TESTPS.TXT output.
