SUMMARY
=======

If you install an Identity Module in the PROM port of an Epson LQ-1000 printer,
you cannot print using the LQ-1000 printer driver supplied with Microsoft
Windows. Instead, you are limited to text-only printing using the Generic Text
printer driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An Identity Module is a small plug-in cartridge available from Epson for
installation on their LQ-1000 model printers. It is designed to emulate the
Diablo 630 printer, as well as the IBM 5152. Therefore, it limits the LQ-1000
capabilities to text-only printing. This results in a loss of graphics printing
capabilities and is most noticeable when attempting to print from Microsoft
Windows Paintbrush.

The Identity Module is installed inside the right rear area of the printer
through an access door. You can remove this cartridge at any time; however, it
should be done while the printer is off.

After removing the cartridge and restoring power to the printer, you can use the
LQ-1000 printer driver supplied with the retail package of Windows.
