SUMMARY
=======

SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.0, which comes with Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1 does not support changing the cache sizes multiple times at the
MS-DOS command prompt, or removing and reactivating SMARTDRV.EXE after first
loading it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Once SMARTDRV.EXE is loaded with a cache size in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, the size
of the cache can only be changed by rebooting the computer (this apples to cache
sizes other than the normal MS-DOS level cache size and Windows cache size
arguments). Once SMARTDRV.EXE is loaded, the only way to remove it is to reboot
the computer and not to load it.

Some third-party disk caching software allows for the cache size to be changed by
using an MS-DOS command line switch. Some of these disk caches also support
removing themselves from memory with an MS-DOS command prompt switch.
SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.0 does not support either of these functions.
