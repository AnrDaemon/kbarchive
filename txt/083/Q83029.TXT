SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the video modes supported while running MS-DOS-based
applications in a window under Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 in
386 enhanced mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows 3.1, all video drivers perform identically to the drivers shipped
with Windows 3.0 when you run MS-DOS-based applications in a window, except the
following drivers:

 - 8514

 - TIGA

 - SVGA

 - VGA

The 8514, TIGA, SVGA, and VGA drivers support the following video modes when you
run MS-DOS-based applications in a window:

 - 0Dh

 - 0Eh

 - 0Fh

 - 10h

 - 11h

 - 12h

The other drivers that ship with Windows 3.1 and drivers based on Windows 3.0 are
only capable of running mode 0Fh in a window.

These other drivers are able to display MS-DOS-based applications that use video
modes 0Dh, 0Eh, 10h, 11h, 12h in a window if the current screen does not need to
be redrawn or updated. This way it is possible to select and copy text to the
Clipboard. When it is time for the screens to be updated, the application must
be switched back to full screen. Switching from a window to full-screen mode and
back can be done in two different ways:

 - Make the MS-DOS-based application active and then press ALT+ENTER.

   -or-

 - From the Control menu (-) in the upper-left corner of an MS-DOS-based
   application running in a window, choose Settings, select Full Screen, and
   then choose the OK button.

If you attempt to update an MS-DOS-based application running in a window in a
mode other than 0Fh, the following error message appears:

   You cannot run this application while another high-resolution application is
   running.

After this has come up and been dismissed, Windows beeps if you make any
subsequent attempt to update the screen, press keys, and so on. The application
must be changed to full-screen mode before continuing.

Video mode 13h is not capable of running in a window. If you attempt to run a
13h-mode screen in a window, the following error message appears

   Insufficient Memory

and the screen will have to be changed back to full screen before the MS-DOS
application is viewable.
