The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a

While running Microsoft Windows in real mode from the OS/2 version 1.x
MS-DOS compatibility box, Windows File Manager disk commands (Format
Disk, Copy Disk, Label Disk, and Make System Disk) are not available.
This limitation is by design and necessary because of the architecture
of the OS/2 MS-DOS compatibility box.

To work around this problem, you must use the OS/2 File Manager to
access these functions.
