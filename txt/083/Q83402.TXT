======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you remove the Wingdings TrueType font that ships with Microsoft Windows
version 3.1 from the list of installed fonts in Control Panel, the Flying
Windows screen saver no longer displays the Windows flag. Instead, the flags are
replaced with small colored dots.

CAUSE
=====

The flag logo is actually character number 255 in the Wingdings font set; that
character must be installed so that the screen saver utility can recognize and
use it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can change the character that displays in the logo by modifying the file
SSFLYWIN.SCR as follows:

1. Make a backup copy of the SSFLYWIN.SCR file.

2. Open the SSFLYWIN.SCR file in Microsoft Write and choose No Conversion.

3. Search for the word "display." Right before the word display is the y umlaut
   character (the letter "y" with two dots over it).

4. Change that character to another character.

   NOTE: You can use Character Map to find a character number. In the character
   set that Windows uses, character number 255 is the y umlaut character for
   regular text fonts (such as Times New Roman). By substituting a different
   character, you can make a different Wingdings symbol appear.

5. Save the file as SSFLYWIN.SCR, and test it in the Desktop dialog box of
   Control Panel.
