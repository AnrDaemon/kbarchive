KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using NWPOPUP.EXE, you don't receive messages from other users and
servers while Windows is running. Instead, the messages are queued and displayed
after you quit Windows.

CAUSE
=====

This situation can occur when:

 - You use a version of NWPOPUP.EXE that predates the release of Windows 3.1
   with Microsoft Windows or Windows for Workgroups.

   -or-

 - You use the version of NWPOPUP.EXE supplied from Novell.

   -or-

 - You use the Windows 3.11 version of NWPOPUP.EXE supplied with Windows for
   Workgroups 3.11 (which does not include NWPOPUP.EXE).

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use the MS-DOS EXPAND utility that ships with your
version of Windows to expand and copy a current version of NWPOPUP.EXE from your
original Windows disks. For example:

   expand a:\nwpopup.ex_ c:\windows\system\nwpopup.exe

NOTE: If there is a version 3.0 NWPOPUP.EXE in the Windows directory, it is
loaded instead of the Windows 3.1 version.
