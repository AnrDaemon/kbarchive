SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for the CONVINFO data structure used by the Dynamic Data
Exchange Management Library (DDEML) lists the possible values of the structure's
wStatus field. However, the documentation does not elaborate on the causes of
these different values.

The following table lists the various values of the wStatus field and the
conditions under which each status code is reported:

   wStatus        Cause
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   ST_ADVISE      One or more links are in progress.

   ST_BLOCKED     The conversation is blocked.

   ST_BLOCKNEXT   The conversation will block after calling the next
                  callback.

   ST_CLIENT      The conversation handle passed to the
                  DdeQueryConvInfo function is a client side handle.
                  If the ST_CLIENT value is 0, then the conversation
                  handle passed to the DdeQueryConvInfo function is a
                  server side handle.

   ST_CONNECTED   The conversation is connected.

   ST_INLIST      The conversation is a member of a conversation list.

   ST_ISLOCAL     Both sides of the conversation are using the DDEML.

   ST_ISSELF      Both sides of the conversation are using the same
                  instance of the DDEML.

   ST_TERMINATED  The conversation has been terminated by the other
                  side.
