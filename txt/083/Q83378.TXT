 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The IdleWild screen saver included in the Windows Entertainment Pack versions
1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, does not hide applications that use the Always On Top command
if this option is active. The chosen screen saving display appears, but the
application continues to display over the screen saver.

This problem occurs with Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If an application has the Always On Top command, it appears as a menu item on
the application's Control menu. A check mark beside the Always On Top command
indicates that this command is active. To enable or disable the Always On Top
command, click the option itself.

Applications known to have an Always On Top option include the following:

   Windows 3.1 Clock
   Windows Resource Kit version 2.0 System Resource Monitor
   Windows Resource Kit version 2.0 Smartdrive Monitor
   Windows Resource Kit version 2.0 Topdesk
   Windows 3.1 WinHelp
