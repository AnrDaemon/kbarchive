SUMMARY
=======

A hot key can be assigned to Program Manager by placing PROGMAN.EXE in the
startup group and assigning a hot key through the properties dialog.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To do so:

1. Double click the startup group to make it active.

2. From Program Manager, choose File and then New.

3. Select Program Item and then OK.

4. In the Description text box, type:

   Program Manager

5. In the Command Line text box, type:

   PROGMAN.EXE

6. Choose OK.

7. Choose the Program Manager icon in the startup group to make it active.

8. From File Menu, choose Properties.

9. Select the Shortcut Key section.

10. Assign a shortcut key combination.

This works because Program Manager is a single instance application. A "single
instance application" is one that will run only once; even if you double click
the icon a second time, this merely makes the application active. Some
applications allow you to run multiple instances, the application WRITE.EXE is
an example.
