The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Video Seven proprietary resolution modes are not supported in virtual machines
under Windows version 3.0.

A virtual display device (VDD) specifically for the Video Seven cards is required
to provide this functionality. Such a device is not shipped with Windows 3.0,
although a Video Seven specific 640 x 480, 256-color display driver (V7VGA.DRV)
is supplied.

Instead, Video Seven "pure VGA mode" support is built into the Windows 3.0 VDDVGA
(standard VGA VDD) device.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to Video Seven technical support, updated Windows 3.0 display drivers
and a Video Seven specific VDD are now available. Please contact Video Seven for
availability information.

Also, updated Windows 3.0 display drivers for the Video Seven V-RAM, 1024i, and
FastWrite video cards can be obtained from the MISCELLANEOUS section of the
Bulletin Board System (BBS) maintained by the Video Seven Technical Services.

For additional information, contact Video Seven Technical Support.
