SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows version 3.1, all printer drivers support TrueType fonts
except for the Generic/Text Only printer driver (TTY.DRV) and the plotter driver
(HPPLOT.DRV).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Printer drivers support TrueType in one of two ways:

 - All dot-matrix printer drivers, the Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet driver
   (HPDSKJET.DRV), the Canon LBP II and III drivers (LBP8II.DRV and
   CANONIII.DRV), and the Olivetti DM109/309 driver (DM309.DRV) support printing
   TrueType fonts as raster graphic data. The IBM 4019 driver (IBM4019.DRV, also
   known as the Lexmark 4019), the original HP LaserJet, LaserJet Plus, and
   LaserJet 500+ also support TrueType fonts in this way.

 - Other printer drivers support TrueType by downloading TrueType font
   information to the printer, the same way that other soft fonts are
   downloaded, and then requesting the font the same way other device- resident
   fonts are requested. This is the way that TrueType is supported for the HP
   LaserJet Series II (and later HP LaserJet models, including the HP LaserJet
   III family), and the PostScript driver (PSCRIPT.DRV).

Printer drivers written for Windows 3.0 by original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs) automatically support TrueType fonts if they support printing bitmap
fonts (such as TmsRmn and Helv in Windows 3.0 and MS Serif and MS Sans Serif in
Windows 3.1). If they don't, these drivers must be modified to support TrueType
fonts.
