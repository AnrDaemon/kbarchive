The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the WIN.INI settings used by the Windows version 3.1
PostScript driver (PSCRIPT.DRV) versions 3.5, 3.51, 3.52, and 3.53.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Example:

      WIN.INI
      [QMS-PS 810,COM2]
      ATM=placeholder
      LandscapeOrient=90
      CtrlD=0
      minoutlineppem=N
      favortt=0

[Modelname,Port] LandscapeOrient=angle [default: 90]
----------------------------------------------------

This setting determines the angle to which the paper is rotated in order to get
landscape orientation. Earlier versions of the driver use 270 degree rotation;
however, this is opposite to most other laser printers that use 90 degrees. To
get the earlier landscape orientation, change this value to 270.

If envelopes appear to print rotated 180 degrees from normal, changing this
switch's setting may also help.

Printing imported images (EPS files, and so on) in landscape mode from some
particular applications (for example, Aldus PageMaker 4.0) may result in
improper placement/orientation of the image. Setting this switch to 270 may
correct the problem.

[ModelName,Port] CtrlD=0,1 [default 1]
--------------------------------------

Under normal circumstances, the Windows PostScript driver places a CTRL+D
character at the start of a print job to put the printer back into a clean
state, or reset it. Some printers and/or environments do not want CTRL+D
characters placed in the beginning of the PostScript output. If CtrlD is set to
0, no initial CTRL+D character is generated. If CtrlD is set to 1, the driver
generates CTRL+D characters if the printer description states that the printer
accepts CTRL+D characters.

[Modelname,Port] minoutlineppem=N   [default: 101]
--------------------------------------------------

When TrueType fonts are downloaded as Adobe Type 1 fonts (set in the Control
Panel, Printers, Setup, Options, Advanced dialog box) the driver downloads Adobe
Type 3 bitmaps for fonts whose points-per-em (PPEM) are less than this INI
setting, and Type 1 fonts that are larger.

To conserve memory, lower this value (0=use one outline for all point sizes). To
maintain absolute quality at higher point sizes, make this value larger
(32767=use bitmaps for all point sizes), but the same thing can be accomplished
by setting use Type 3 bitmaps in the Advanced dialog box.

Note: If you change the minoutlineppem setting, you must exit and restart Windows
for the changes to take effect.

[Modelname,Port] favortt=0,1  [default: 0]
------------------------------------------

If a request for a font can be equally satisfied by both a device font or a
TrueType font, use the TrueType font if favortt is set to 1. Otherwise use a
device font.

These ties can easily occur. For example, if the application requests Tms Rmn but
only Times and Times New Roman are available, this is considered a tie.
