TITLE   :Reasons for Windows 3.1 Setup to Fail While Upgrading
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Windows version 3.1 Setup program fails while upgrading from an
earlier version of Windows, and one of the following messages may be displayed:

   Error loading

   -or-

   Error loading <driver.drv>

where <driver.drv> is the name of the system driver identified in the
"SYSTEM.DRV=" line of the SYSTEM.INI file.

CAUSE
=====

An invalid or missing (blank) driver setting in the [boot] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file can cause the Setup program to fail during an upgrade.

Setup attempts to load drivers that end with the extension "DRV" that are located
in the [boot] section when Setup shifts to protected mode.

For example "SYSTEM.DRV=SYSTEM.DRV" is a valid setting for a driver.

Setup may also fail if the video driver settings are correct, but the video card
is not compatible with Windows 3.1. In this case, a message similar to the
following is displayed:

   Error loading COMM.DRV

WORKAROUND
==========

The specific driver mentioned in the error message will vary. To troubleshoot
this problem, install Windows, selecting EGA for the video graphics adapter. If
the installation succeeds, then you have a problem with your video card.

Successfully Upgrading
----------------------

The following are steps to successfully upgrade an earlier version of Microsoft
Windows if the above errors are encountered:

1. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file in the Windows directory.

2. Locate the [boot] section.

3. Change the SYSTEM.DRV= line to read as follows:

   SYSTEM.DRV=SYSTEM.DRV

4. Restart the Setup program from the original Windows 3.1 system disks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to the above error messages, the following information is recorded
in the BOOTLOG.TXT file in the Windows directory:

      [boot]
      LoadStart = DRIVER.DRV
      LoadFail = DRIVER.DRV Failure code is 02

If the SYSTEM.DRV setting is blank, the following information is recorded in the
BOOTLOG.TXT:

      [boot]
      LoadStart =
      LoadFail =  Failure code is 02

NOTE: The BOOTLOG.TXT file that records errors during setup is located in the
failed WINDOWS directory. This file can be viewed with a text editor (such as
the MS-DOS 5.0 Editor) or a word processor.

Besides SYSTEM.DRV, the following invalid or blank settings may also cause an
error during setup:

      KEYBOARD.DRV=
      MOUSE.DRV=
      DISPLAY.DRV=
      COMM.DRV=
