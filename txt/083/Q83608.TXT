When you attempt to use the Go To Page command in the File menu of
Write, Write does not seem to go the right page number, but stays the
same. The Go To Page command in Write may require repagination before
Write can recognize different page numbers.

When a file is retrieved, for example README.WRI, Write may not apply
the repagination automatically.

To repaginate:

1. From the File menu in Write, choose Repaginate. Write displays the Repaginate
   Document dialog box.

2. Choose OK. Write displays "Repaginating Document" in a dialog box.

After repaginating, Write should show a correct page number when you
use the Go To Page command or when you page up or down.
