SUMMARY
=======

Windows version 3.1 does not permit you to change printer cartridges from within
the common printer dialog boxes (COMMDLG.DLL).

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows 3.0, some applications allowed you to change printer cartridges. From
the File menu, choose the Printer Setup command inside the application. You can
then choose the appropriate configuration for your printer. The Windows
Accessories group under Windows 3.0 allow this.

For example:

1. Run Write.

2. From the File menu, choose the Printer Setup command.

3. Select the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III (or any printer that supports
   cartridges under Windows).

The Setup dialog has options for various printer cartridges.

The common dialog boxes in Windows 3.1 do not support cartridge changing. Using a
common dialog application can change orientation for that application only,
without resetting the orientation for all Windows-based applications. The
accessories shipped with Windows 3.1 that use the printer common dialog are
Write, Paintbrush, Notepad, Terminal, Calendar, and Cardfile.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.1
