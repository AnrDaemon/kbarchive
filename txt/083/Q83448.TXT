SUMMARY
=======

Windows version 3.1 displays the following error message if you use a corrupt
TrueType font:

   Invalid TrueType Font Detected
   An application used a TrueType font that caused an error in Windows
   Quit all applications, and then restart Windows

MORE INFORMATION
================

As a result of this error, TrueType fonts may no longer be available in your
application. This problem occurs because after Windows detects an invalid
TrueType font, it disables TrueType fonts availability to maintain the integrity
of the system. To enable TrueType fonts again, quit all your applications, then
restart Windows.

Make sure you delete and reinstall the corrupt font before using it again. If you
don't know which font is causing the error message, follow the steps below to
determine which font is corrupt:

1. Open the Control Panel, and double-click the Fonts icon.

2. Click each font entry in the Installed Fonts list.

3. Check the line "The size of the font on the disk is: X" If the size is either
   0 (zero)K or 2K, you must remove and reinstall that particular font. For
   information on how to add and remove TrueType fonts, refer to pages 166 and
   168 in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.1.

If you attempt to reinstall the font without restarting Windows, the following
message appears:

   TrueType fonts are disabled

   To use TrueType fonts, select the enable TrueType Fonts check box in the
   TrueType dialog box, and then restart Windows before installing TrueType
   fonts.

All you need to do is restart Windows; TrueType fonts are enabled automatically.
