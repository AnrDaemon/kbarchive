SUMMARY
=======

You may encounter minor distortions when using Microsoft Windows operating
system version 3.1 TrueType fonts at certain point sizes; for example, when
Courier New Bold is used in 19 or 20 point, the horizontal bar of the "e" is
only one pixel thick, but at smaller point sizes, the bar is thicker.

Informal testing has shown that is a video display problem only and will not
affect printing.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 3.1. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.1 true type
