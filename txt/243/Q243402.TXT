MORE INFORMATION
================

Event ID 9280 indicates that the message transfer agent (MTA) has reached its
limit for concurrent LAN-based MTA connections. Currently, this limit is
approximately 240 concurrent associations for each MTA.

Note that this limit relates only to bridgeheads which serve a large number of
remote procedure call (RPC)-based connectors, such as site connector. X.400
connections do not factor into this total concurrent association count for the
240 limitation. For additional information about Event ID 57 from the Exchange
