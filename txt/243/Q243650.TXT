TITLE   :BUG: MSDN Library Favorites Are Lost

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

The MSDN Library favorites are lost.

CAUSE
=====

There are three known causes of this problem:

 - Installing a new version of the MSDN Library does not transfer existing
   favorites from the previous version.

 - Launching the MSDN Library from a Visual Studio product can result in lost
   favorites. If the MSDN Library is still open when the Visual Studio product
   is closed, any favorites created during that session are lost. Closing the
   Visual Studio product forces the MSDN Library to close without providing an
   opportunity for it to save the new favorites.

 - Deleting or corrupting the Hh.dat file erases favorites.

RESOLUTION
==========

The MSDN Library Favorites Utility can transfer favorites from one library
installation to another. This utility is on the Start menu for the latest
quarterly releases of the MSDN Library. You can also download this utility from
the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/resources/msdnfav.asp
   (http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/resources/msdnfav.asp)

When using the MSDN Library launched from a Visual Studio product, always close
the MSDN Library first before closing the Visual Studio product. This allows the
MSDN Library to save the new favorites information normally.

If the Hh.dat file is deleted or corrupted, there is no way to recover the
favorites. When the Hh.dat file is deleted, the MSDN Library creates a new one
with no favorites information in it. When the Hh.dat file is corrupted,
favorites may be lost or behave incorrectly, forcing you to delete the Hh.dat
file, so it can be re-created.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
