PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0

KEYWORDS:kbhw kbnetwork kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT server running Remote Access Services (RAS) with a Digi AccelPort
8r 920 multiple-port adapter does not answer incoming calls after the first call
per line.

CAUSE
=====

The Digi AccelPort 8r 920 multiple-port adapter connects to an RJ45 input/output
(I/O) serial box. This connection requires a 10-pin RJ45 connector-to-DB25 cable
that is supplied by Digi. If you are using an 8-pin RJ45 connector-to-DB25
cable, pin 1 (Ring Indicator, or RI) and pin 10 (Data Carrier Detect, or DCD)
are not connected. RAS uses RI for answering incoming calls.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the 8-port Octopus cable with DB25 connectors in this configuration.
