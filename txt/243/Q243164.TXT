SYMPTOMS
========

In some cases, users may want small print jobs to consecutively print on one
page and roll over to the next page only when the first one has been filled. If
these jobs end with an End Bracket (EB) sent from the host, however, each job
will print on a separate page.

CAUSE
=====

Job termination in the SNA Server print session properties is set to End Bracket
Received by default. Therefore, when the End Bracket is received from the host,
the SNA Server assumes the job is complete and starts the next job on a new
page.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the properties of the print session in question, select the 3270 tab and
check the Unbind Received radio button for Job Termination. With this option
checked, the SNA Server does not end the print job until it receives an UNBIND
from the host.

Some hosts may not be configured to send an UNBIND. If this is the case, a job
timeout setting is also needs to be specified in the print session properties.
See below for more information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Unbind Received option is checked for Job Termination, the print jobs are
queued until there is enough data to fill a page. If the user wants the data to
start printing as soon as the data is received from the host, without being
queued, you can specify the number of seconds the job should wait before
printing. This option can also be set in the print session properties on the
3270 tab. To do so, check the Timeout Job After box and enter the desired number
of seconds.

NOTE: Be sure to set the number of seconds high enough to accommodate the amount
of time it takes to receive the entire print job from the host. Otherwise, only
part of the job may be received before printing begins, resulting in incomplete
print output. Experimenting with this value helps the user to determine an
appropriate number of seconds.
