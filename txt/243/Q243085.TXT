   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you use the System Preparation Tool (SYSPREP) to clone a "master computer"
and you double-click the shortcuts on the cloned computer, the associated
programs may take a long time to start.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the shortcut is resolving the path on the master
computer and not on the cloned computer.

This issue occurs because shortcuts you create on a computer automatically embed
a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path in the .lnk file. The default shortcut
resolution method is to resolve the link to the original location of the file
before it looks at another path where the file exists.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, make the following changes in the Windows registry before
you run the System Preperation Tool.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Add the Explorer key to the following registry key if it does not exist:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\

3. Add the following value to the Explorer registry key:

Value Name: LinkResolveIgnoreLinkInfo
Data Type: REG_DWORD
Data: 1 (enable)

4. Click OK.

5. restart the computer.
