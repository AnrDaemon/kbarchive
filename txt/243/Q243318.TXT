SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up and use the Display Heap tool (Dh.exe) to
troubleshoot User-mode memory leaks in processes and services.


MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Dh.exe is a character-mode tool for displaying information about heap allocations
in a process, or pool usage in Kernel-mode memory. The use of Dh.exe for
troubleshooting Kernel-mode leaks is beyond the scope of this article.

When the heap-tracking global flags are set in the registry, a database is
created at system startup that contains real-time information about memory
allocation activities. At the instant that an allocation or a free is performed,
a snapshot of the current thread's stack is recorded and stored in the database.
You can use this information to identify the cause of a memory leak.

To enable allocation tracking:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the GlobalFlag value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager

3. On the Edit menu, click DWORD, type "23000" (without the quotation marks),
   and then click OK. This value sets the following bits in the global flag:

   Create user mode stack trace DB
   Create kernel mode stack trace DB
   Enable Debugging of Win32 Subsystem

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Install the debug symbols in the %SystemRoot%\Symbols folder.

number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

6. Rename the original Ntdll.dll file to Ntdll.fre. This is best done across the
   network or from a parallel install of Windows NT to prevent sharing
   violations.

7. Copy the checked version of the Ntdll.dll to the %SystemRoot%\System32
   folder.

8. Copy the checked version of the Ntdll debug symbol file (Ntdll.dbg) to the
   %SystemRoot%\Symbols\DLL folder.

9. Shut down and restart the computer to allow the changes to take effect.

10. Create a batch file named Dhsnap.bat in the folder in which Dh.exe is
   located. The batch file should contain the lines in the sample file listed
   below:

   @echo on
   set _NT_SYMBOL_PATH=%SystemRoot%\Symbols
   dh.exe -p %1 -m -l -s -g -h

After you follow the steps listed above, the system is ready for allocation
tracking. You can use Dh.exe to extract the data from the allocation database
after the leak begins:

1. Identify the process ID (PID) of the process that you are troubleshooting
   (the target process). You can do this by running Tlist.exe from the Windows
   NT 4.0 Resource Kit.

   NOTE: If Tlist.exe is not available, you can obtain the PID by pressing
   CTRL+ALT+DELETE, clicking Task Manager, clicking the Processes tab, and
   locating the PID of the target process in the list.

2. It may be necessary to give the current user "All Access" permissions to the
   target process if the process has special security settings. You can do this
   with the Pview.exe tool included with the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit. Run
   Pview.exe and click the target process. Click Process Security to activate
   the Security dialog box. Add the current user to the list and give that user
   "All Access" permissions. Click OK to apply the changes. Quit Pview.exe.

   NOTE: Pview.exe settings are volatile and are reset to the defaults when you
   restart the system.

3. To generate the Dh.exe log data, run the batch file you created above against
   the PID of the target process from a command prompt. If you do not specify
   the PID, an error message is displayed.

   For example, the following command generates a Dh.exe dump of process 116:

   C:\NTRESKIT>dh.exe -p 116 -m -l -s -g -h
   DH: Writing dump output to C:\NTRESKIT\DH_116.dmp

The log file generated by Dh.exe is a text file that contains heap tracking
information for the targeted process. For each heap, all call stacks that
resulted in a memory allocation (and do not have a correlating free) are
recorded in the "Heap Hogs" section. Call stacks charged with the greatest
allocations are at the top and decrease down the log. Note that steady state
should be considered (meaning that some code may not return memory for days by
design). Leaks are usually obvious from the log and they are always at the top.
After you locate the problem call stack, examine the source for each function
within the call stack until you find the leak.

==========

The utilities mentioned in this article (Dh.exe, Pview.exe, and Tlist.exe) are
available with Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit Supplement 2 or later.

Checked builds of the Ntdll.dll and Ntdll.dbg files are available in Microsoft
Developer Network (MSDN).
