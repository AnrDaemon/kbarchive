TITLE   :Nslookup "ls" Command Generates "***Can't List Domain" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the "ls" command with the Nslookup tool, you may receive the
following error message:

   ***Can't list domain <name>: Query refused

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, type the TCP/IP address of the local Domain Name
System (DNS) server in the notify list. The Nslookup "ls" command then runs
successfully. However, DNS logs warning event 7062 once in the Event log:

   DNS Server encountered a packet addressed to itself -- IP address
   <w.x.y.z>.
   The DNS server should never be sending a packet to itself. This situation
   usually indicates a configuration error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message described above occurs under the following circumstances:

 - You run the Nslookup "ls" command locally on your DNS server to list a local
   domain.

 - The "Only Allow Access from Secondaries Included on Notify List" option is
   enabled on your DNS server's zone, and the DNS server's local TCP/IP address
   is not entered in the notify list.

In this case, DNS assumes that a query of a non-authorized DNS server is received
and the error message is returned.

The hotfix allows the Nslookup "ls" command to return successfully without adding
the local TCP/IP address to the notify list. However, the following messages are
logged in the Event log:

   6000 (Informational) DNS_EVENT_ZONEXFR_START
   DNS Server initiating transfer of zone %1 to DNS server at %2.

   6001 (Informational) DNS_EVENT_ZONEXFR_SUCCESSFUL
   DNS Server transfer of zone %1 to DNS server at %2, successfully completed.

NOTE: If you use the hotfix and unnecessarily add the local TCP/IP address to the
DNS server's notify list, warning 7062 is still logged in the Event log once for
every zone to which this applies. When you restart the DNS server, you also
receive the warning once for every zone that has the server's local address in
its notify list.
