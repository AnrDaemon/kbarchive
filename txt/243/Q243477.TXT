KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install an intermediate network driver (for example, the DynamicAccess
software intermediate driver from 3Com), your Terminal Server computer may
display a blue screen error message in Tcpip.sys with a STOP 0x0000001E. The
second DWORD of the stop code is 0xC00000005. This behavior has only been
observed on multiprocessor computers.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Tcpip.sys driver does not properly initialize
on multiprocessor computers.
