   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

A Terminal Server client running on a Microsoft Windows 95-based computer using
the ABNT2 Brazilian keyboard layout may receive the following error message when
attempting to log on to the Terminal Server:

   The keyboard layout of requested language could not be opened. US English
   keyboard layout will be used instead. You may choose another layout from your
   Client Settings.

After you click Continue, the Terminal Server English keyboard layout is in use.
This is true even if you only have the ABNT layout installed on the server or if
you have multiple layouts installed and have the ABNT layout set as the default.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition,
only includes the ABNT keyboard layout. Terminal Server Edition does not include
the ABNT2 keyboard layout (Windows 95 and Windows 98 include both).

WORKAROUND
==========

that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
