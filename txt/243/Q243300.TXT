======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have appropriate Systems Management Server (SMS) security rights and
try to remotely control an SMS client, you may be unable to do so, and you may
receive the following error message:

   Remote Tools
   Security rights to run remote tools on this client have been denied.

Note that this problem may also occur when you run the Remote.exe command from a
command prompt.


Also, you may receive the following error message (or one that is similar to it)
in the Smsprov.log file:

   *
   *
   E:\OPALSP1\sdk_provider\nt\smsprov\SspStatusMessage.cpp(420) : User
   "DOMAIN\user" is unknown to SMS security and does not have permissions to log
   status messages.
   *
   *

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when SQL is configured to use a case-sensitive sort order
and the logged-on user name that the MMC retrieves from the workstation does not
match the case of the user name in the Systems Management Server Administrator
Console under Site Database\Security Rights.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
