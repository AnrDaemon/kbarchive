TITLE   :Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Restarts Unexpectedly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using your Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition-based
server, it may restart for no apparent reason. Also, you may see the following
event in the System log:

   Event ID: 6008
   Source: Event Log
   Description: The last system shutdown was unexpected.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if a user with administrative privileges modifies the
computer policy to permit shutdown from authentication. When this feature is
enabled, any client that is connected to the Terminal Server has the capability
of restarting the Terminal Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
   System Policy Editor.

2. Click File, and then click Open Registry.

3. Click Windows NT System, click Logon, and then click the "Enable shutdown
   from Authentication" command on the Logon menu to remove the check mark.

NOTE: Changing the System policy back to default values removes this option from
all client sessions, but an administrator still has the option to shut down the
Terminal Server from the Authentication dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The event message listed earlier in this article is the only indication of this
issue.
