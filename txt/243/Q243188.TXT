TITLE   :Unable to Browse RAS Clients from the Local Area Network
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Clients that dial in to a Remote Access Services (RAS) server using only the
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) do not appear in the
browse list on clients on the local area network (LAN). Such a RAS client,
assuming it is configured properly to view the browse list in Network
Neighborhood, sees the LAN clients and also sees itself in the browse list.

RESOLUTION
==========

To cause LAN clients to be able to view RAS clients, install the NetBEUI
protocol on the RAS clients and server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use only TCP/IP, HOST announcements are not broadcast to the LAN. When
you use the NetBEUI protocol dial-up connection, the NetBIOS gateway forwards
HOST announcements to the LAN. The NetBEUI protocol allows RAS clients to
communicate with the browser servers on the LAN through the NetBIOS gateway on
the RAS server. The NetBEUI protocol therefore allows RAS clients to be added to
the LAN browse list.
