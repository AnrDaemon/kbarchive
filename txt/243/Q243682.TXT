======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual InterDev, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There are two commands that can be used to synch Web sites. They are Recalculate
Links and Synchronize Files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These two commands are documented in the Visual InterDev help file (see
"References"), but they don't detail what they do when the project is under
Source Control.

Recalculate Links:

This command updates the Web site to contain everything in Visual SourceSafe.
Thus, any files that have been added to the project in Visual SourceSafe are
then brought down onto the Web server.

Steps

1. Add a file to the project in Visual SourceSafe.

2. Open the Web project in Visual InterDev.

3. Right-click the project file in Project Explorer and select Recalculate
   Links.

   NOTE: The same can be done from FrontPage by selecting Tools and then choosing
   Recalculate Hyperlinks.

Synchronize Files:

This command does not have any effect in Visual SourceSafe; it functions the same
way that the Visual InterDev documentation states, irrespective of Source
Control.
