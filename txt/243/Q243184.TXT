TITLE   :XFOR: Lotus cc:Mail Usernames Added to Bcc Line If in DL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If you send a message to a distribution list (DL) that contains Exchange Server
users and Lotus cc:Mail custom recipients by including the DL in the To line,
the cc:Mail custom recipient names are added to the Bcc line in the message when
it is received by cc:Mail.

For example, if a DL called Ccm_dl contains cc:Mail custom recipients called
Ccuser at DB8 and Ccuser2 at DB8 as members, when Ccuser receives a message that
has been addressed to the DL, it has the following information in the header:

   To: Ccm_dl
   Bcc: Ccuser at DB8, Ccuser2 at DB8

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design. This behavior is not encountered if you use the
custom recipient names instead of the DL in the To line.

Additional query words: ccmc, db6
