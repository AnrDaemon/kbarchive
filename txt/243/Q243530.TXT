PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode kbwizard kbAppSetup kbDownload kbVBp kbVBp600 kbCodeDownload kbGrpDSInet kbDSupp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When packaging applications using Microsoft Windowless Controls, the Visual
Basic Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) references the MSWLess.cab file linked
to the site http://activex.microsoft.com/controls/vb6/MSWLess.cab, which does
not exist.

CAUSE
=====

The file MSWLess.dep incorrectly points to the above site. The MSWLess.dep file
should not contain any entries for CABFileName, CABDefaultURL, or CABINFFile.
Microsoft Lightweight Controls are not meant for distribution over the Web.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use these controls for Web-based applications.

-or-

Remove lines containing CABFileName, CABDefaultURL, and CABINFFile from the
MSWLess.dep file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
