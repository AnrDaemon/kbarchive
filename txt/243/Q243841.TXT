   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

In some instances, you may want to change the Exchange Server organization,
site, or server name to reflect changes in the Exchange Server structure, rather
than removing and reinstalling the Outlook Web Access (OWA) component.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Enterprise, Server, and Site registry values need to be modified on the OWA
server to reflect the changes in the organization, site, or Exchange Server
computer that the OWA server connects to.

To modify these registry values on the OWA server, you must edit the registry.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Change the following registry values, as applicable:

    - To change the organization:

      a. Locate the Enterprise value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeWeb\Parameters

      b. On the Edit menu, click REG_SZ, type the organization name, and then
         click OK.

    - To change the server:

      a. Locate the Server value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeWeb\Parameters

      b. On the Edit menu, click REG_SZ, type the server name, and then click
         OK.

    - To change the site:

      a. Locate the Site value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeWeb\Parameters

      b. On the Edit menu, click REG_SZ, type the site name, and then click OK.

3. Quit Registry Editor.

4. You must restart the World Wide Web service for the changes to take effect.
