TITLE   :"Error Communicating with Component" Querying for Service Status
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork kbtool kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the SMS_NT_Logon_Discovery_Agent thread in Systems Management
Server (SMS) Service Manager to query for its status, you may receive the
following error message or one similar to it:

   Error communicating with component

CAUSE
=====

If Windows Networking Logon Client Installation is enabled but Windows
Networking Logon Discovery is not enabled, the Microsoft Windows NT Domain
controllers do not get the SMS_NT_Logon_Discovery_Agent installed. This agent
appears in the SMS Service Manager tool, but when you query this agent, you
receive the error message listed earlier in this article. It is by design
behavior that the SMS_NT_Logon_Discovery_Agent (which runs as a service on
domain controllers) would not be installed, and so would not be able to respond
to a query request.

RESOLUTION
==========

To verify the agent is not installed on the domain controllers, you can use the
Windows NT Server Manager to connect to that server, or if you are at the
console of a domain controller, use the Services tool in Control Panel to search
for the SMS_NT_Logon_Discovery_Agent. Note that it should not be there.

If Windows Networking Logon Discovery is enabled, the domain controllers should
receive the SMS_NT_Logon_Discovery_Agent service, and query requests within the
SMS Service Manager tool should be successful in displaying a started or stopped
status.
