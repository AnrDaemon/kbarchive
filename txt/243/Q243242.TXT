TITLE   :XADM: Mailbox Manager Application Error with Exclude Mailboxes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the "Exclude Mailboxes" button on the Policies tab of the
"Mailbox Manager Properties" page, you receive an application exception (Dr.
Watson) error message.

When running on Windows 2000, the Exchange Administrator program may unexpectedly
exit with no error displayed.

CAUSE
=====

A recipient within the site has no e-mail address.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create an e-mail address for the recipient. The address doesn't have to be valid
or even a valid type. The type could be "NOTHING" and the value could be
"NOTHING".

If the mailbox is not needed, removing it can resolve the problem, too.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mailbox Manager 5.5.2650.23.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the Administrator program to find mailboxes with no e-mail addresses:

1. Click the Recipients container for the site.

2. On the View menu, click Columns, and then add "E-mail addresses" to "Show the
   following columns".

3. Visually scan the list of recipients, looking for a gap in the "E-mail
   addresses" column.

4. On the View menu, click Hidden Recipients, and scan the Recipients list
   again.

NOTE: If there are multiple Recipients containers, you must repeat these steps
for each one.

The Mailbox Manager creates its exclusion list by adding an e-mail address to
excluded recipients of type MBX with a value of 1. This means that you can
generate an exclusion list through bulk import as well as through the Mailbox
Manager user interface. To remove a mailbox from the exclusion list, set the
address value for MBX to 0.

Refer to Exchange Server documentation for more information about bulk import and
export.
