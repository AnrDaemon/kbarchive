OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Component Object Model (COM) dynamic-link library (DLL) is registered with
a path longer than 127 characters, activation of the DLL does not succeed and
the following error message is generated:

   0x80040154 "Class not registered"

The same DLL (with a path longer than 127 characters) can be loaded using
CoLoadLibrary/LoadLibrary, but COM cannot activate it.

CAUSE
=====

Activation of a COM DLL uses a small buffer to read the 32-bit DLL information
from the registry. The registration information is not retrieved if the COM DLL
is registered with a path longer than 127 characters.
