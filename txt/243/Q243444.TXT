TITLE   :BUG: <CSTDLIB> Does Not Define the Namespace "STD"
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbVC600bug kbDSupport kbGrpDSVCCompilerkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to reference a function from the STD C++ library header
<cstdlib> using the namespace STD (for example, std::exit(0)) causes the
compiler to emit a C2653 or a C2039 (depending upon whether or not namespace
"STD" is defined at the point where the error is emitted).

CAUSE
=====

<cstdlib> does not define the namespace "STD". This is contrary to the
VC++ documentation, which says:

   "Include the standard header <cstdlib> to effectively include the
   standard header <stdlib.h> within the std namespace."

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, place the "#include <cstdlib>" in the
namespace "STD".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Attempting to compile the following will cause the compiler to display the
following error:

   "error C2653: 'std' : is not a class or namespace name"

   // Compile Options:  /GX
   #include <cstdlib>

   void main()
   {
        std::exit(0);
   }

However, attempting to compile the following causes the compiler to display the
following error:

   "error C2039: 'exit' : is not a member of 'std'"

   // Compile Options:  /GX
   #include <vector>
   #include <cstdlib>

   void main()
   {
        std::exit(0);
   }

In the first case, the C2653 is displayed, because the namespace "STD" has not
been defined. In the second case, the C2039 is displayed, because the namespace
"STD" has been defined (in the header <vector>), but the function exit is
not part of that namespace. To work around the problem in either case, simply
enclose the "#include <cstdlib>" in the namespace "STD", as follows:

   // Compile Options:  /GX
   namespace std {
   #include <cstdlib>
   };

   void main()
   {
        std::exit(0);
   }
