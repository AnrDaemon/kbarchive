The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start any of the programs listed at the beginning of this
article, the program may not start after the opening video clip is played.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you install Flight Simulator for Windows 95 or Flight
Simulator 98 to the folder in which Flight Simulator 2000 is installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove both versions of Flight Simulator, delete the
Flight Simulator folder, and then install both programs into separate folders:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, and then
   click Add/Remove.

4. When you are prompted to confirm the removal of Flight Simulator 2000, click
   OK.

5. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 or
   Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95, and then click Add/Remove.

6. Click OK or Remove All, and then follow the instructions on the screen to
   remove the program.

7. Delete the Flight Simulator folder. By default, Flight Simulator 2000 is
   located in the following folder:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2000

   For information about how to delete folders in Microsoft Windows, click Start,
   click Help, click the Index tab, type "deleting files, folders" (without the
   quotation marks), and then click Display.

8. Install each version of Flight Simulator to a separate folder. To do this,
   insert the Flight Simulator CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.

   If the installation program does not start automatically:

   a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

   b. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

   c. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Install, and then click Finish.

   d. Follow the instructions on the screen to install Flight Simulator.

   Repeat this step to install each version of Flight Simulator into a separate
   folder.

   NOTE: When you are prompted to choose a location for the second version of
   Flight Simulator, choose a different folder than you selected in the first
   installation.
