TITLE   :XCON: Incorrect Internet Mail Service Msg Size Restriction
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, you can set message size
limits for mail processed by the Internet Mail Service. After you apply Exchange
Server Service Pack 3, the Administrator program may display an incorrect
message size. This is only a issue with displaying the correct size; the correct
size is actually used by the Internet Mail Service for message size
restrictions.

CAUSE
=====

The Administrator program is incorrectly multiplying the message size limit
value by 102.4. This issue only affects the value reflected in the Administrator
program.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce this behavior in the Administrator program:

1. On the Internet Mail tab of the Internet Mail Service, click the E-Mail
   Domain button next to Specify by E-Mail Domain.

2. Add a domain or edit an existing domain.

3. Specify a value in the Maximum size field.

4. Click OK to quit the Internet Mail Service configuration.

5. Open the Internet Mail Service configuration again, and note the Maximum size
   field. The value that you entered before is multiplied by 102.4. For example,
   if you entered 2000 before, the value appears as 204800.
