TITLE   :XCLN: Outlook 97, 98 Cannot Clear Wrap to Window Option Default
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97,98
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use Microsoft Word as the e-mail editor in the Outlook client, you can
select an option to "Wrap to window". If you select the "Wrap to window" option
and clients other than Outlook open your message, the message wordwraps
correctly when it is opened, rather than displaying paragraphs as one long line.
In Outlook 97 or Outlook 98 this option is always selected as the default and
you cannot clear it as a default setting. If you want to clear this option you
must clear it manually in each new mail message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can set this option when you compose a new message; in the new message, on
the Tools menu, click Options, and then either click to select the "Wrap to
window" check box or click to clear the "Wrap to window" check box, as
applicable.


The "Wrap to window" check box can be cleared as the default in Outlook 2000.
