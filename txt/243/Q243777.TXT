-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Save in the Save File As common dialog box, nothing may happen,
or the contents of the Look In box may change.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the the File Name box contains an asterisk (*) or
question mark (?). These characters are reserved for use as wildcards and cannot
be used in a file name.

RESOLUTION
==========

Specify a file name that does not contain an asterisk or question mark.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design and is shared by all Windows-based programs that use
the common Save File As dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use wildcards to reference more than one file name by using special
characters. A wildcard is a character (either an asterisk or a question mark)
that is used to express that any combination of characters is allowed in a
certain section of a string. For example, if you want to list all files that
begin with the string "user" but can contain any other characters and any
extension, use the following wildcard:

   user*.*

If you want to list all files that start with any character, then contain the
string "user" and have any extension, use the following wildcard:

   ?user*.*

File names that contain other illegal characters, such as a colon (:), generate
the following error message:

   <Filename> This filename is not valid.

The characters that are valid for a file or folder name include any combination
of letters (A-Z) and/or numbers (0-9), plus the following special characters:

   $   Dollar sign
   %   Percent 
   '   Apostrophe
   `   Opening single quotation mark
   -   Hyphen
   @   At sign
   {   Left brace
   }   Right brace
   ~   Tilde
   !   Exclamation point
   #   Number sign
   (   Opening parenthesis
   )   Closing parenthesis
   &   Ampersand 
   _   Underscore
   ^   Caret
       space
   +   Plus sign
   ,   Comma
   .   Period
   =   Equal sign
   [   Opening bracket
   ]   Closing bracket
