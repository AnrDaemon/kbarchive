TITLE   :Foreign Performance Counters Do Not Load
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbKernBase kbOSWin2000 kbPerfMon kbDSupport kbGrpDSKernBase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Performance Monitor in Windows 2000 is used to select performance
objects and counters of a foreign machine, instead of selecting and displaying
the counters, the following error message is displayed:

   Machine Not Found

CAUSE
=====

The Performance Monitor cannot select counters through a foreign counter
performance extension because of a problem in the Performance Data Helper,
Pdh.dll, library.

RESOLUTION
==========

If it is necessary to view performance counters from a foreign system on Windows
2000, use the Performance Monitor, Perfmon.exe, from Windows NT 4.0, which is
available in the Windows 2000 resource kit.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Foreign counters are those that are exposed from a non-Windows NT system (for
example, Unix) to be viewed through the Windows NT or Windows 2000 Performance
Monitor. A third party supplies the foreign counter performance monitor
extension that works similarly to the regular performance monitor extension. The
foreign performance monitor extension is loaded when a machine name or IP
address of a machine not running Windows NT or Windows 2000 is selected in
Performance Monitor.

The new Windows 2000 Performance Monitor uses Pdh.dll to access performance
counter data. The Pdh.dll file cannot access counters through a foreign counter
extension.
