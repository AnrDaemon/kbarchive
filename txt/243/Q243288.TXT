The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3

SUMMARY
=======

SNA Server allows two different ways to create a Host Security Domain (HSD).

 - Using the Host Security Domain Wizard (recommended)

 - Using the "Insert" option

   If the Insert option is used, two additional steps are required in order to
   employ Host Security Integration (HSI).

   1. Assign a Connection to the Host Security Domain that was recently created. Do
   this by right-clicking on the HSD name and then click Assign Connection.

   2. In User Manager for Domains, add the Domain User group to the HS Domain group
   (this would be the actual name given when creating the Host Security Domain
   Name).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Insert option was used but the two steps listed above were not done, you
get various errors. For example, if a connection was not assigned to an HS
Domain and you tried to save the configuration in Manager, the following error
message is displayed:

   The Host Security domain <HSD_Name> does not contain any connections.
   In its current configuration the Host Security domain is not usable. Do you
   wish to continue saving the config file? - Yes/No

If the Domain User group was not assigned to the HS Domain group and you tried to
open up the Host Account Manager (UDConfig.exe), you receive this message:

   There is no record of the selected user in the Host Account Cache. Please
   select a different account.

If you view the application log of the event viewer, the following error is
reported from SNA Host Security:

   Event 1298

   Unable to locate user account information Supplied code PMP
