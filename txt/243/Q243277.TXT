SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install the Microsoft Windows 95 Year 2000 Update
(W95y2k.exe) without installing Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 2
(SP2).

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: If you do not install Internet Explorer 4.01 SP2, which is included in the
Windows 95 Year 2000 Update, you must separately evaluate Internet Explorer for
year 2000 issues. For example:

 - Internet Explorer version 2.x and earlier has not been tested for year 2000
   issues.

 - Internet Explorer 3.02 has updates available to address year 2000 issues.

 - Internet Explorer 4.x requires Internet Explorer 4.01 SP2 or later to address
   year 2000 issues.

To install the Windows 95 Year 2000 Update without installing Internet Explorer
4.01 SP2, use one of the following procedures:

Normal Installation
-------------------

To install the Windows 95 Year 2000 Update typically, double-click the W95y2k.exe
file. If you are prompted to install Internet Explorer 4.01 SP2, click Cancel,
and then click OK.

NOTE: If Internet Explorer 1.x, 2.x, or 4.01 SP2 or later is detected on your
computer, you are not prompted to install Internet Explorer 4.01 SP2.

If Internet Explorer 3.0x through 4.01 Service Pack 1 (SP1) is detected on your
computer, a dialog box that prompts you to install Internet Explorer 4.01 SP2 is
displayed. If you click Cancel, you receive a message stating that Microsoft
recommends that you install Internet Explorer 4.01 SP2. When you click OK, the
Windows 95 Year 2000 Update should be installed without installing Internet
Explorer 4.01 SP2.
