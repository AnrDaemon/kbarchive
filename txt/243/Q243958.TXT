The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 98

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Systems Management Server (SMS) client on a Windows
95-based or Windows 98-based computer that is running the Novell intraNetWare
Client version 3.11, the computer may become slow and unresponsive during the
logon process and during the following actions:

 - restoring mapped network drives
 - starting programs
 - printing response

In addition, other functions may also perform considerably slower.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, upgrade the intraNetWare Client to the latest
version of this redirector. There is currently a patch available for version
3.11, which is version 3.11b, that addresses this behavior. To download this
patch, refer to the following Novell Web site:
