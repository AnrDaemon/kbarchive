======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to restore missing Default and Anonymous accounts that
are normally assigned to an Exchange Server public folder. By default, the
default accounts have assigned to them "Author" level permissions, and the
anonymous accounts have assigned to them "None" level permissions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An Exchange Administrator or owner of a public folder may intentionally or
unintentionally remove the Default or Anonymous accounts of an Exchange Server
public folder. When this is done, these accounts do not appear in the list of
permissions for the public folder. This may also cause unintended access
problems for some users. It is preferable to set the access level for these
default accounts to None rather than delete them altogether.

Only an Exchange Server Administrator or a user with Owner permissions to the
public folder may restore these default names to the Permissions tab so they may
be configured with the appropriate settings. If an administrator or owner of the
public folder simply accesses the Permissions tab of the folder, the default
accounts will be re-displayed with their default values of None. Once the user
selects OK on the Properties dialog box, the names will be restored to the
public folder. The following steps show how to restore these default accounts in
either the Microsoft Outlook client or the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program.

Restoring Permissions Using Outlook
-----------------------------------

NOTE: You must be an Owner of the folder to perform these steps.

1. In Outlook, find the public folder in the public folder hierarchy,
   right-click the public folder, and then click Properties.

2. Click the Permissions tab. Note that the Default and Anonymous roles are
   displayed and are set to None.

3. Modify the permissions as necessary, and then click OK.

Restoring Permissions Using the Exchange Server Administrator Program
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the public folder, and
   then click Properties on the File menu.

2. On the General tab, click Client Permissions. Note that the Default and
   Anonymous roles are displayed and are set to None.

3. Modify the permissions as necessary, and then click OK.
