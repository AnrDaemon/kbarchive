SYMPTOMS
========

During the MSN 5.0 CD-ROM installation, your computer appears to freeze and no
error messages are displayed.

CAUSE
=====

Is is possible that there is a warning dialog that has appeard but is not
visible as it is hidden behind the Setup screen and the computer senses a
time-out.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior:

1. Minimize the Setup screens and see if there is a warning dialog in the
   background that is hindering the Setup process.

2. If so, then close the warning dialog (or follow any applicable instructions),
   and then continue the Setup.

If the Setup screens still appear to be frozen, then close Setup, and restart the
installation process.
