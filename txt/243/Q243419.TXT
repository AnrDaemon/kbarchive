TITLE   :Setpass Does Not Update the NetWare Password with SYSKEY
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) server includes the setpass
command-line tool (located in SYSVOL volume) to change users' password.

If both SYSKEY and RestrictAnonymous are used on the server, only the Security
Accounts Manager (SAM) password is updated and not the NetWare password. The
next time you log on, the NetWare connection against the FPNW server does not
work and you must type your old password.

CAUSE
=====

When the system starts, it tries to load all password notification packages.
When SYSKEY is used, Fpnwclnt.dll (the notification package installed by FPNW)
does not initialize because it tries to gain access to data encrypted with
SYSKEY, but the key is not yet initialized by the system.
