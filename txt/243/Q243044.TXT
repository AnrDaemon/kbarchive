SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to display a virtual
directory in Internet Information Server (IIS), the MMC may show that the
virtual directory is unavailable and not enumerate the directory contents as
expected. This can happen when the virtual directory is designated as a
Universal Naming Convention (UNC) connection to another computer. The connection
may appear as though the computer is not available on the network.

CAUSE
=====

When the actual UNC connection has not been previously established, the MMC
attempts to connect using the logged-on user. If the logged-on user does not
have the proper access to the share, then the MMC fails to enumerate the virtual
directory correctly.

This only occurs in the MMC, and not to the Web services. This does not affect
the functionality of the Web services because IIS scans the metabase for the
proper credentials to make the UNC connection. Therefore, the virtual directory
is usable to the Web server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make a UNC connection to the system that the
virtual directory is using, prior to starting the MMC.
