TITLE   :PRB: Scroll Box on ActiveX Image Control Causes Image Distortion
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbActiveX kbContainer kbCtrl kbvfp600 kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Moving the scrollbars on an OLE Image control contained on a FoxPro form causes
a part of the image to be distorted. Black areas might also appear on the form.
If the left-mouse button is released while scrolling, the control acts as if the
mouse button is still depressed. Moving the mouse causes the image to scroll
even though the left button is not depressed. Clicking the left-mouse button on
the form returns the control to normal.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, avoid scrolling with scroll box. Use the scroll arrows located
at the top and the bottom of the scrollbar to scroll the image.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Place the following code sample into a .PRG file (in this article, assume
   that the file is named TEST.PRG):

   ***Start of code
   public xform
   xForm=CREATE("form")
   xForm.VISIBLE = .T.
   xForm.HEIGHT = 350<BR/>
   xForm.CAPTION = "Image Test"
   * Kodak Image control available on Windows 98
   * xForm.ADDOBJECT("image","olecontrol","imaging.editctrl.1")
   * Wang Image control available on NT 4
   xForm.ADDOBJECT("image","olecontrol","wangimage.editctrl.1")
   xForm.IMAGE.VISIBLE=.T.
   xForm.IMAGE.WIDTH = 300
   xForm.IMAGE.HEIGHT = 300
   xForm.IMAGE.LEFT = 25
   xForm.IMAGE.TOP = 25
   * Replace below with file to display. Must be big enough for scrollbars to appear.
   xForm.IMAGE.IMAGE = 'tony1600.jpg'
   xForm.IMAGE.DISPLAY
   xForm.SHOW
   ***End of code

2. Execute the program from the Command window by typing:

"DO TEST" (without the quotation marks)

3. Release the left-mouse button while scrolling the image rapidly using the
   mouse on the scroll box. Move the mouse without clicking the left button and
   watch the image move and become distorted.

4. Click anywhere on the form to release the scrollbar.
