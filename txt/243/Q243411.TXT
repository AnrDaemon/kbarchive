TITLE   :SmartStor Jukeman Files Occupy Twice the Space on NTFS Partition
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A SmartStor Jukeman file may occupy twice the amount of drive space that is
required for the file after the file is copied or moved on an NTFS partition.
The file's properties list the correct amount of space, but the file uses twice
that amount of space on the hard disk.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a problem in SmartStor Jukeman version 2.3.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, upgrade to SmartStor Jukeman version 2.4.1 or later.

To work around this problem, copy the file to a FAT partition and then back to
the NTFS partition. When you copy the file to a FAT partition, you remove the
data stream that causes the file to occupy twice the required space (because
NTFS partitions support data streams but FAT partitions do not).
