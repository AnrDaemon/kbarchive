TITLE   :STOP 0xA in Netbt.sys Occurs on Domain Master Browser
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your domain master browser (generally a primary domain controller) may stop
responding and you may receive a "Stop OxA in Netbt.sys" error message on a blue
screen with the following parameters: 0x000000fc, 0x00000002, 0x00000000,
0xfc7ac47a.

NOTE: The fourth parameter may vary, but the error is in the Netbt.sys driver
address space.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the master browser receives a broadcast packet with a
source address of 0.0.0.0. When the master browser attempts to respond to the
broadcast packet, a structure used by NetBT is not filled out correctly.
