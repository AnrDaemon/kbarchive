TITLE   :SNARAS Traces Continually Grow in Size If Left Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0 SP1,4.0 SP2,4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSNA400sp4fix kbSNA400PreSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the SNARAS traces are enabled, the trace files
%WinntRoot%\System32\Snaras.trc and %WinntRoot%\System32\Rassna.trc will
continue to increase in size if you do not disable tracing. Eventually, the
files will consume all disk space remaining on the boot partition.

CAUSE
=====

The trace versions of Snaras.dll and Rassna.dll on the SNA Server 4.0 compact
disc do not use the same tracing mechanism as the other SNA Server traces.
Therefore, there is no limit to how large the files can grow.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack

SP2, and 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.
