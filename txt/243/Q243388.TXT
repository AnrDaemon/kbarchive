======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 (all SP), 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Shared Folders connections fail when two or more AS/400 definitions use the same
User ID, but different passwords. When attempting to connect to a folder
definition on one of the AS/400s, customers may receive the following error
message:

   X:\ is not accessible.
   While accessing the hard disk, a disk operation failed even after retries.

CAUSE
=====

The Shared Folders gateway service stores only one instance of the User ID and
password. Because of this, one password is used for all AS/400 definitions with
the same User ID. This results in security violations, which can be seen in a
Shared Folders Gateway API trace.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

This problem only affects two or more AS/400 definitions using the same User ID,
but different passwords. Customers can avoid this problem by using a unique User
ID for each AS/400 definition, or by using the same User ID and same password
for each AS/400 definition.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Shared Folders gateway service should be stopped before applying this fix,
and then restarted after the fix has been successfully applied.
