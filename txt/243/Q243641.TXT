-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Asheron's Call, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your inventory is full and you attempt to exchange an item in your inventory
for an item belonging to a computer character in Asheron's Call, the computer
character may take your inventory item, but you may be unable to accept the item
from the computer character.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs, because the computer character still sees your inventory
as being full.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, make sure there is sufficient room in your
inventory before you attempt to exchange an inventory item with a computer
character.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Asheron's Call version
1.0 for Zone.com.
