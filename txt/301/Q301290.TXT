TITLE   :FP: From Address Not Same as Reply-To in Results Sent to E-mail
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 2000 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 2002 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you receive the results of a Microsoft FrontPage form that is configured to
send the results to an e-mail recipient, the From address does not match the
Reply-to address you designated in the Form Properties dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because you can only configure the Reply-to address in the
Form Properties dialog box and the From address on the Web server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, ask the Web server administrator to configure the
From address mail setting on the Web server using FrontPage Server Extensions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In FrontPage, when you set up options for form results to be sent to an e-mail
recipient, you can specify a To address and a Reply-to address in the Form
Properties dialog box.

A Web adminstrator can configure the From and Reply-to addresses or the Web
servers mail and Contact addresses for FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions or
FrontPage Server Extensions 2002, respectively. All of this information
populates different fields in the message header when the message is sent,
similar to this:

   Date: 01 Jan 2001 09:00:00 -0500
   From: <someone@microsoft.com>
   To: <msbob@microsoft.com>
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
   Content-Type: Text/plain; charset=windows-1252
   Subject: This is a test
   MIME-Version: 1.0
   Reply-to: example@microsoft.com

When you receive the form results in e-mail, the message appears to be from the
e-mail address specified in the From field, and the reply should go to the
address designated in the Reply-to field when you defined the form's properties
in FrontPage.

Both Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express support the Reply-to field
in e-mail messages. Other messaging programs may not support this field. For
more information, see the documentation for your e-mail client.

To view the message header in Outlook 2002 or Outlook Express 5.5, use the
appropriate method for your situation.

Outlook 2002:

1. Start Outlook 2002 and locate the message for which you want to view the
   header information.

2. Right-click the message and then click Options on the menu that appears.

3. In the Internet headers box, view the header information for the selected
   message.

Outlook Express 5.5:

1. Start Outlook Express 5.5 and locate the message for which you want to view
   the header information.

2. Right-click the message and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

3. Click the Details tab.

4. In the "Internet headers for this message" box, view the header information
   for the selected message.
