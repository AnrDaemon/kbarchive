SUMMARY
=======

When you are running Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000 End User Client and
making a configuration modification, (either through the SNA resource location
or by manually editing the registry, for example, adding Keepalive), the changes
do not exist when another user logs on to the same computer.

For additional information about adding Keepalive, click the article number below

MORE INFORMATION
================

During the installation of HIS 2000 End User Client, all registry information is
added to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SNABase\Parameters

When the HIS 2000 End User Client is started for the first time, the SNABase
program copies the SNABase registry entries from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to
HKEY_CURRENT_USER:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SNABase\Parameters

If a user logs on and the registry data (the SNABase key) has already been copied
to HKEY_CURRENT_USER, any subsequent changes to the SNABase key under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE will not be copied over to HKEY_CURRENT_USER for that user.

If entries to the SNABase key have been changed under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE since
the HIS 2000 End User Client was first installed, any new user that has never
run the HIS 2000 End User Client before on this computer, gets the updated
SNABase key under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE as it is copied over to HKEY_CURRENT_USER.

This behavior does not occur with the SNA Server 3.0 or 4.0 Microsoft Windows 95
Client because registry entries are written only to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

These changes were made to accommodate better support for customers running the
HIS 2000 End User Client on Windows Terminal Server.
