SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to upgrade from Microsoft Windows NT Server Internet
Information Server (IIS) 4.0 to Microsoft Windows 2000 Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0.


Requirements
------------

The minimum requirements for IIS 5.0 closely match the requirements for Microsoft
Windows 2000 Professional, Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, and Microsoft Windows
2000 Advanced Server. Although the hardware requirements for IIS 5.0 depend
heavily on the amount of traffic that the server will experience, the following
system hardware should meet the needs of most environments:

 - Processor: 400 MHz Pentium II (or faster)

 - RAM: 128 MB (or more)
 - Connection: 100MB/Sec. Network Card
 - Drive: SCSI Single Drive or SCSI Array

Important: Microsoft highly recommends that you replicate the server's Web site
content and configuration settings to another server before you upgrade your Web
server.

Back up the IIS Metabase
------------------------

Before you upgrade the Web server with Windows 2000 Server, back up the IIS
metabase file. To back up the IIS metabase:

1. In the IIS management console, right-click the server name (for example, in
   the Internet Information Server folder: *mywebserver), and then click
   Backup/Restore Configuration.

2. Click Create Backup.

3. In the Configuration Backup Name text box, type a name for the backup, and
   then click OK.

For information on how to create a backup of the metabase for IIS 4.0, see the
"References" section of this article, which contains a URL link to detailed
instructions.

NOTE: When you backup the metabase, a file is created with the name
<backup_name>.md0 (the last character in the extension is a zero; not the
letter O). The file is stored in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Inetsrv\Iis.msc
folder.

Data Recovery Recommendations:

Best practice dictates that you ensure that all critical data is backed up to
either a remote share or tape prior to the upgrade. This should include the
metabase backup file that you just created and stored in the
%SystemRoot%\System32\Inetsrv\Iis.msc folder, as well as all Web content.

Upgrade the Operating System to Windows 2000 Server
---------------------------------------------------

1. Insert the Windows 2000 compact disc into the CD-ROM drive. If AutoPlay is
   enabled, the Windows 2000 Setup Wizard should start. If not, run Setup.exe
   from the CD-ROM drive.

2. Click Upgrade to Windows 2000, click Next, and then follow the instructions
   provided by the Windows 2000 Setup Wizard.

By default, IIS 5.0 installs during the installation of Windows 2000 Server and
Windows 2000 Advanced Server. When you upgrade from Windows NT Server 4.0 to
Windows 2000, IIS 4.0 is automatically upgraded to 5.0.

NOTES:

 - IIS 5.0 files are copied into the INETSRV folder. Existing IIS 4.0 files are
   overwritten.

 - IIS 5.0 uses the existing IIS 4.0 metabase file. All configuration options
   from IIS 4.0 are left in place. IIS 5.0 sets default values in the metabase
   for new features that are included in IIS 5.0, such as World Wide Web
   Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) and HTTP Compression.

 - IIS 5.0 uses the existing IIS 4.0 IUSR_<computername> and
   IWAM_<computername> accounts.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Unlike IIS 4.0, which allows you to specify the location of the Web and FTP root
folders, Windows 2000 automatically places everything in the Inetpub folder on
the system drive. The only way to install IIS 5.0 on a different drive is to
perform an unattended installation. For information about unattended
installations, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article, Q259671 "How to Change
the Default Installation Paths for FTP and the Web" (listed in the "References"
section of this article), the Deployment Planning Guide in the Windows 2000
Resource Kit, and the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Guide to Unattended Setup"
(Unattend.doc), which is located in the Support\Tools\Deploy.cab folder on the
Windows 2000 CD-ROM.
