SYMPTOMS
========

You have an MSN Companion device that has been upgraded to Version 2.0, and your
attempts to connect via Broadband are unsuccessful.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the issue

1. Make sure that the USB to Ethernet Adaptor that you are using is one that is
   supported. See

   Q301477 Broadband-Supported USB-Ethernet Adaptors

.

2. Check the settings in the Connection Status box. Note that if "network
   adaptor connected" is set to "No" then all of the items will be populated
   with "No".

   To resolve this issue, check your network adaptor and make sure that it is
   connected properly to the USB Ports on the device.

3. If "DHCP or Static IP detected" is set to "No", click the "my broadband
   connection requires more specific settings" link. The "broadband settings"
   page opens.

   Note:

    - If clicking the "Obtain an IP Address automatically (recommended)" link
      fails to populate the boxes, contact your ISP directly for more
      information.

    - If you are using a home network, you should be able to determine what
      needs to be provided in order to get the device to function properly.
      Note: MSN Technical Support does not provide assistance in configuring
      home networks for customers.
