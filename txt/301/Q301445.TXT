======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Personal Web Server on a computer running Microsoft
Windows 98, you may receive an error message similar to the following:

   DllRegisterServer failed on
   C:\\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\inetsrv\iischema.dll,0x80070057
   The parameter is incorrect.

When you click OK, you receive several instances of the following error message:

   pws-error

   GetData, 0x80070057
   The parameter is incorrect.

When you click OK to each of the messages, installation of Personal Web Server
completes.

After Personal Web Server is installed on your computer, a Publish icon appears
on your desktop as expected. However, the Personal Web Server icon is not
displayed in the system tray. In addition, when you click Advanced in Personal
Web Manager, folders are missing from the Virtual Directories list.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs when you do not log on to the computer on which you are
installing Personal Web Server. The network stack must be active before you
install the core components of Personal Web Server. To activate the network
stack, you must log on to the computer. If you click Cancel on the logon screen,
the network stack is disabled, Personal Web Server is not installed correctly,
and you receive the error messages described in the "Symptoms" section of this
article.
