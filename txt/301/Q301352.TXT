======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the software distribution feature of Systems Management Server
(SMS) to distribute software, a small percentage of the clients may not report
the status properly in the Administrator console. The more clients per Client
Access Point (CAP) that run the advertisement at the same time, the higher the
percentage of clients that are missing the status. When you check the client
computers manually, it appears that the program did run the advertisement
successfully, and any software in that advertisement is present. The client logs
are normal except for the Cqmgr32.log log file, which contains one or more
entries that are similar to:

   --Validating Item 'Item 61949725'
   --Servicing Item 'Item 61949725'
   --Inserted Item[Item 61949725] into list
   --Trying to copy Item[Item 61949725], copy try no. 1
   --Item[Item 61949725] NOT copied, already exists, set status to Remove
   --Skipping Item 'Item 61949725', it is marked for deletion
   --Removing Item 'Item 61949725'

CAUSE
=====

The Cqmgr32.log file corresponds to Copy Queue Manager(CQMGR) on the client
computer. The CQMGR component is the client component that is responsible for
copying files from the client to the appropriate Inbox on an available CAP.
During typical processing, CQMGR creates a random file name and then attempts to
copy the file to the Inbox. If the file name is already in use, the operation
does not succeed. When this occurs in the copy operation, the CQMGR component
creates a new random file name and tries the operation again up to 50 times. The
algorithm that is used in the fix associated with this article replaces the
algorithm that is used to generate the random file names with a better algorithm
that is not sensitive to time synchronization.

This problem also exists with other files that the client components send to the
CAP. However, it is most noticeable with status messages because they are most
common.
