TITLE   :HOWTO: Add MSXML Support to a C++ Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE eMbedded Visual C++, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Platform SDK for Pocket PC 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Some Windows CE-based platforms include support for the Microsoft XML component,
but no examples of calling the XML component from C++ on Windows CE platforms
are available in the online documentation. Many of the existing desktop examples
will not work because they utilize the COM compiler extensions (through the
#import statement) which are not currently supported in the Windows CE
development environment. This article describes what is necessary to incorporate
XML support

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MSXML component is declared in the MSXML.h file. This includes everything
that is necessary to access the component including:

 - Class and interface identifiers

 - Interface declarations

To use these declarations, you can simply include the MSXML.h file in any source
files that access the component. If you are porting desktop code that accesses
the component through a namespace, you can achieve a similar effect, without
needing to edit all of the scoped references to the namespace, by including
MSXML.h in a namespace. For example, if the code you are porting accesses the
IXMLDOMDocument interface like this

   MSXML::IXMLDOMDocument

the MSXML component is declared in the MSXML namespace. You can achieve the same
effect in Windows CE by including MSXML.h as follows:

   namespace MSXML
   {
   #include <msxml.h>
   }

To link the application, include Uuid.lib in the list of linker object/library
modules.
