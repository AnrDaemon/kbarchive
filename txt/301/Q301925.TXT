KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When messages are sent through a newly configured Microsoft Exchange Connector
for Lotus cc:Mail and the messages that are received in cc:Mail contain white
text that is displayed on a blue background. This behavior may occur when
message body colors are not set on the cc:Mail post offices where the mailboxes
are located.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install a new cc:Mail post office, you can set the message body default
colors. When you configure the downstream cc:Mail post offices to have black
text that is displayed on a white background, if the default colors are not set
on cc:Mail post office that the Connector for cc:Mail connects to, all of the
messages that pass through this post office contain white text that is displayed
on a blue background, regardless of the setting at the downstream post offices.
This behavior can occur even though there are no users on the post office
connected to the Exchange Server computer.
