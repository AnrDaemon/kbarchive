SUMMARY
=======

Archiving both mail and directory synchronization messages that pass through the
Microsoft Exchange Router for Novell GroupWise is sometimes necessary for
troubleshooting purposes. To enable this archiving feature, you must create a
new entry in the Exchange 5.5 server's Exchconn.ini file. After you have enabled
archiving, you can locate the archives in the
Exchsrvr\Connect\Echconn\GWrouter\Archive directory.

Note: When you activate the archive feature, you have to manually purge archives
from the hard disk. If you leave archiving enabled indefinitely, it may
eventually fill the hard disk with archived items. It is recommended that you
activate the archive feature only during troubleshooting sessions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable archiving:

1. Open the Exchconn.ini file in Notepad. This file is located in the
   Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn folder.

2. Under the LME-GWISE section, add the following entry:

   Archive=1

3. Save this file.

4. Stop and restart the Exchange Router for GroupWise.

The procedure to enable archiving for the Exchange Connector for GroupWise mail
in Exchange 2000 is a completely different procedure. For additional
