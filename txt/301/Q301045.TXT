SYMPTOMS
========

When you print colored text on a black background to a black and white printer,
all non-white or light-gray text may be printed as black.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because of limitations in the Unidrv.dll file that prevent
colors from mapping correctly to their halftone counterparts when you print.
Print quality may be lower than normal when you try to print half-tone text.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact the manufacturer of your printer to inquire about
the availability of a printer driver that does not use the Unidrv.dll file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if your printer driver uses the Unidrv.dll file, right-click your
printer in the Printers folder, click Properties, and then click Print Test
Page. The test page lists all of the .dll files that are used by your printer
driver.
