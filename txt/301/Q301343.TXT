The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4, 1.99 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Because of security concerns, the Passport Login server URL cannot be loaded
into a frameset.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Passport Login server URL must always be the top window in the object model.
Do not call LoginUser from within any framed page. If LoginUser is called from
within a frameset and is viewed by a non-Passport-aware client application, the
end user receives a runtime error from the browser scripting engine due to cross
frame scripting security issues.

Specify target="_top" for any HREF that points to the Login server if your site
uses frames. Note that you may have to parse and reform the output of the
LogoTag2 method if you intend to include the Passport link in a framed document.
