TITLE   :SMS: Remote Control Freeze When Remote Desktop Connection Starts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdisplay kbtool kbui kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are initiating a Systems Management Server (SMS) Remote Control session
into a Microsoft Windows XP client, the screen may freeze if a Remote Desktop
session is also started from a separate computer to the same Windows XP client.
When the Remote Desktop session finishes, the SMS administrator can pass
keyboard and mouse commands to the remote computer, but the administrator may be
unable to receive any screen refreshes from the client.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because SMS is not aware of the conventions that are used
in Windows XP to signal that a Remote Desktop session is starting.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, disconnect the SMS remote control session, and then
reconnect after the Remote Desktop session finishes.
