When you attempt to start MechWarrior 4, the MechWarrior Vengeance splash screen
appears, then a black MechWarrior Vengeance window appears, and then the

This issue can occur when the colors settings in the Display Properties dialog

3. In the Display Properties dialog box, click the Settings tab.

   The following message appears:

   The settings you have chosen may cause some programs to operate
   improperly if you do not restart your computer now.
   Would you like to:

    - Restart the computer with the new color settings?

    - Apply the new color settings without restarting?

6. Click "Apply the new color settings without restarting?", click OK, and then
   click OK in the Display Properties dialog box.
