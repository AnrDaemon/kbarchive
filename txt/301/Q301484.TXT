TITLE   :Command Prompt Returns to Prompt Without Running App or CMD
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2000,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some DOS commands and 16-bit programs may not run from a command prompt. For
example, if you type the dir command, and then press ENTER, nothing is displayed
as shown in the following example:

   C:\> dir

   C:\>

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the ComSpec system environment variable is not
pointing to a valid location for Cmd.exe file. Command.com is dependent on the
Cmd.exe file. If you move or delete the Cmd.exe file, you will encounter this
behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, run Cmd.exe from the location to which you moved it,
or update the ComSpec system environment variable to point to Cmd.exe.

To update ComSpec on a Windows NT 4.0-based computer:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   System.

2. On the Environment tab, click ComSpec.

3. In the Value box, type the location of the Cmd.exe file, and then click Set.
   The default setting is: %SystemRoot%\System32\Cmd.exe.

4. Click Apply.

To update ComSpec on a Windows 2000-based computer:

 - Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, double-click System, and
   then click Advanced.

 - On the Environment tab, click ComSpec, and then click Edit.

 - In the Variable Value box, type the location of the Cmd.exe file, and then
   click OK. The default setting is: %SystemRoot%\System32\Cmd.exe.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem can occur after following the steps that are described on the
following Microsoft Web site:

   Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 Security Checklist
   (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/iischk.asp#28)

In these directions, it is recommended to move the Cmd.exe file to a different
folder to make IIS more secure.

Additional query words: nothing happens
