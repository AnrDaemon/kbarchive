KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbsms200preSP4fix

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you review the Inbox Manager log (the SMS\Logs\Inboxmgr.log file) on a
Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 site server, you may see that the Client.lkp
file is not being updated. This is indicated by the following error report in
the log file:

   Copying X:\SMS\inboxes\clidata.src\client.lkp to
   \\SERVER\CAP_XYZ\clidata.box\client.lkp, Failed, Win32 Error = 32

Because the Client.lkp file is used by clients to determine whether or not they
should resynchronize inventory, the clients that you expect to send a full
inventory may not do so.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the SMS clients have the Client.lkp file open when Inbox
Manager tries to update the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
