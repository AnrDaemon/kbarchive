   (Part 2)

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following topics are covered in part 1 of this article:

 - Types of Error Messages That You May Receive

 - How to Gather Clues About an Error Message

Types of Error Messages that You May Receive
--------------------------------------------

When you run any of the Microsoft games listed at the beginning of this article,
you may receive one of the following three types of error message:

 - Fatal exception

 - Illegal Operation

Fatal Exception:

A "fatal exception" error message is typically displayed on a blue screen, and
appears similar to the following

   A fatal exception <0X> has occurred at <xxxx:xxxxxxxx>

where <0X> is a hexadecimal number from 00 to 0F that indicates the
processor exception, and <xxxx:xxxxxxxx> is the code segment pointer and
memory address at which the exception error occurred.

A fatal exception error can occur if any of the following conditions is true:

 - A program attempts to call an illegal instruction.

 - A program attempts to access invalid data or instructions.

 - The privilege level of an operation is invalid.

For additional information about "fatal exception" error messages, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q150314 Information About Fatal Exception Errors

Illegal Operation:

An "illegal operation" error message appears similar to the following:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the
   problem persists, contact the program vendor.

When you click Details, you receive a detailed error message similar to the
following:

   <Program> caused an invalid page fault in module <filename> at
   <xxxx:xxxxxxxx>.

When you click OK, the program quits.

You typically receive an "invalid page fault" or "general protection fault" error
message when a program or a component attempts to read or write to a memory
address that is not allocated to the program. When this occurs, the program may
overwrite or damage data or instructions for another program that is using that
memory address. You may also receive a different type of "illegal operation"
error message, such as a "divide error," "invalid instruction," or "stack fault"
error message.

For additional information about possible causes of "illegal operation" error
messages, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q82710 Causes of General Protection Faults

NOTE: If you receive an "invalid page fault in module kernel32.dll" error
message, a conflict may exist between the program and the Microsoft Windows
operating system.

module kernel32.dll" error messages, click the article numbers below to view the

   Q218873 OFF2000: Troubleshooting Office Kernel32.dll Errors Under Win 95

How to Get Clues from an Error Message
--------------------------------------

To use the error message to diagnose your problem, note the module name that is
listed in the "Details" section of the "invalid page fault" error message.

If the module name is a printer driver, a video driver, a sound card driver, an
antivirus tool, or a component that is not part of the game, you can remove or
update that module.

If you do not recognize the module name, query the Microsoft Knowledge Base for
the module name at the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://support.microsoft.com/?pr=kbinfo

For example, if you received an invalid page fault in module <unknown>:

1. In the "Search (KB)" box, click the name of the game in which you receive the
   error message.

2. In the "For Solutions containing" box, type "invalid page fault in module
   unknown".

3. In the "Using" box, select The exact phrase entered, and then click Search
   Now.

NOTE: If you do not see the Using box, click Show Options.

How to Get Clues from Events That Precede an Error Message
----------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, you can determine the cause of the problem by noting what occurred
just before you received the error message, whether the problem also occurs in
other programs, or if the problem occurs every time you attempt to perform a
particular action.

To determine the cause of the problem, answer the following questions:

 - Are other programs running on your computer when you receive the error message?

 - Is this a known issue with your game?

 - Does the problem only occur at a particular time, such as when you start the game or when you use a joystick?

 - Does the problem occur in other programs or games?

 - Can you reproduce the problem, or does it occur randomly?

The following sections discuss each question and possible resolutions.

Are other programs running on your computer when you receive the error message?:

You can prevent or resolve many error messages by quitting all programs that are
running on your computer before you start a game.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

2. In the Close Program dialog box, click any program except Explorer or Systray
   (which are components of Microsoft Windows), and then click End Task.

   If you receive a message stating that the program is busy or not responding,
   click End Task again.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to quit all programs except Explorer and Systray.

Is this a known issue with your game?:

Certain "invalid page fault" or "fatal exception" error messages only occur when
specific conditions are true. For more information about how to resolve specific
error messages in the games listed at the beginning of this article, query the
Microsoft Knowledge Base for the exact text of the error message at the
following Microsoft Web site:

   http://search.support.microsoft.com/kb/c.asp

For example, if you received an invalid page fault in module <unknown>:

1. In the "My search is about" box, click the name of the game in which you
   receive the error message.

2. Under "I want to search by", click "Keyword Search using" using, and then
   click Exact Phrase in the "Keyword Search using" box.

3. In the "My question is about" box, type invalid page fault in module unknown,
   and then click Go.

Knowledge Base:

   Q129725 Obtaining Knowledge Base Articles on the World Wide Web

If none of the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base describes your problem,
please continue troubleshooting your problem using the information in this
article.

Does the problem only occur at a particular time?:

If you receive the error message only when you perform a specific action or set
of actions in the game, the actions that trigger the error message may provide
clues about which solutions you should try first.

For example if you only receive the error message when you press a programmed
button on your joystick, you may want to disable programmed buttons, updated the
joystick software, or even update the sound driver for your sound card if the
joystick is connected to the game port on your sound card.

If you receive an error message when you attempt to install the game, your CD-ROM
or DVD-ROM drive may be unable to read the CD-ROM for the game.

For additional information about how to troubleshoot CD-ROM read errors, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q218617 How to Troubleshoot CD-ROM Read Errors

Does the problem occur in other programs or games?:

If the problem occurs in other programs or games, the problem most likely is
caused by an outdated device driver, a damaged or missing component of Windows,
or another program that is running in the background.

NOTE: Although some of the troubleshooting tips and possible solutions in this
article may help with these issue, the focus of this article is to resolve error
messages that are specific to the game listed at the beginning of this article.

Can you reproduce the problem, or does it occur randomly?:

If you always receive the error message each time you perform a specific action
or set of actions, use one of the suggested resolutions for the problem, and
then perform that action or set of actions again. If you no longer receive the
error message, you can assume that the problem is resolved. If you continue to
receive the error message, you need to continue troubleshooting the problem.

If you cannot easily reproduce the problem, use one of the suggested resolutions
for the problem, and then play the game until you feel comfortable that the
problem is resolved. If you continue to receive the error message, try another
possible resolution.

NOTE: Be sure to keep track of the resolutions that you have tried, along with
the results for each one.
