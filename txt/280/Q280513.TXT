-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you build setup disks for a Microsoft Jet-based database application with
the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW), the Package and Deployment Wizard does
not include the Microsoft Jet database engine files. When you install the
application and try to run it, you get the following error message:

   Run-time error '3633'

CAUSE
=====

The Package and Deployment Wizard does not know to add the Microsoft Jet 4.0
database engine if you are using the Microsoft DAO 3.6 Object Library.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the MDAC_TYP.EXE to your setup package.

NOTE: MDAC 2.6 and later no longer include the Jet engine. If you are using MDAC
2.6 or higher, you need to use the Jet redistribution pack.

For more information about downloading the Jet redistribution for use with your
application, see the following Microsoft Web site at:

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
