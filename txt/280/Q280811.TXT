PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::2.5,2.6,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbGrpDSVBDB kbDSupport kbATM kbado270

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), versions 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mixing And and Or criteria in the same filter returns the following error
message:

   Runtime Error '3001' Arguments are of the wrong type, are out of acceptable
   range or are in conflict with one another.

CAUSE
=====

Although there is no precedence when evaluating criteria, when you use And and
Or together in the Filter property, the or criteria must be the last comparison
made.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the error message, use criteria that allows the Or to be the top
comparison.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Microsoft Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. On the Project menu, click References, and then add a Reference to the
   Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.X Library.

3. Insert the following code into the General Declaration section of Form1:

   Option Explicit
   Dim cn As ADODB.Connection
   Dim rs As ADODB.Recordset

   Private Sub Form_Load()
   Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
   Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset

   cn.Open "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Password=;Data Source=path to nwind2000.mdb;User ID=Admin;Password=;" 
   rs.Open "Select * from employees", cn, adOpenDynamic, adLockOptimistic
   rs.Filter = "((lastname like 'd%')OR (lastname like 'l%')) AND (title='sales representative')"
   'rs.Filter = "(lastname like 'd%' AND title = 'sales representative') OR (lastname like 'l%' AND title = 'sales representative')"

   rs.MoveFirst
   Do While Not rs.EOF
       Debug.Print rs.Fields(0).Value
       rs.MoveNext
   Loop
   End Sub

4. Press the F5 key to run the project, and note that error message 3001 is
   returned.

5. Uncomment the second rs.filter line and comment the first. This time, when
   the project is run, note that three records are returned to the Immediate
   window.
