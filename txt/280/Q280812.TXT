SUMMARY
=======

According to IISHelp (http://localhost/iishelp):

   The AppOopRecoverLimit metabase property specifies the maximum number of
   times an out-of-process application will be restarted after a failure. The
   server will not service requests from components that have exceeded this
   limit.

This article describes an error in IISHelp concerning the range of acceptable
values for AppOopRecoverLimit.

NOTE: This property does not apply to in-process applications or extensions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to IISHelp, the range for AppOopRecoverLimit is 1 to 5. But in fact
the actual range is 1 to 0xffffffff.

You can use Adsutil.vbs to set the range for AppOopRecoverLimit at the site level
or the virtual directory level. The following example demonstrates how to use
ADSUtil.vbs to set the AppOopRecoverLimit value to "10":

   cscript.exe C:\Inetpub\AdminScripts\adsutil.vbs set w3svc/1/AppOopRecoverLimit "10"

   cscript.exe C:\Inetpub\AdminScripts\adsutil.vbs set w3svc/1/root/virtualdirectory/AppOopRecoverLimit "10"

AppOopRecoverLimit has the metabase identifier MD_APP_OOP_RECOVER_LIMIT.

For more information, see IISHelp (http://localhost/iishelp).

For more information on using ADUtil.vbs and the IIS metabase, see the
"References" section of this article.

NOTE: Although you may want to increase AppOopRecoverLimit while troubleshooting,
when the problem has been resolved it is in your best interest to return this to
the default value of "5".
