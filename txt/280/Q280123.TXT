If you run an Active Server Page (ASP), an internal net library (NetLib) error
may occur on subsequent attempts to instantiate DB2OLEDB Decision Support
Objects (DSOs):

   Source: "Microsoft DB2 OLE DB Provider"
   IErrorInfo:[0x00000000]"Internal NetLib Error"


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000 Service Pack that
contains this fix.

STATUS

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Run a simple ASP. View the results in a Web browser. Leave Microsoft Internet
   Information Server (IIS) and Microsoft Internet Explorer running.

2. Attempt to instantiate the DB2OLEDB DSO by using any application (Data Links,
   RowsetViewer, and so on). This results in the error (RowsetViewer), which
   shown in the "Symptoms" section.

The expected behavior is that when you connect by using any application, while
the IIS ASP is active, the connection succeeds.
