TITLE   :XCON: MTA Generates 9318 Events on Multihomed Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange550preSP5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) may generate remote procedure
call (RPC) error messages that indicate that communications are failing with
event ID 9318 on a multihomed server. This error message may occur after the MTA
has been upgraded to build 2651.75 or later. The MTA, under certain similar
conditions, may also generate event IDs 9266, 2219, 2206, 2207, and 9321.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the network binding that the MTA needs to use is not
the first binding available. The MTA may, under certain conditions, incorrectly
attempt to use the first binding, and if the server is multihomed and the first
binding is not the binding that the MTA needs to use, the MTA cannot establish a
connection to other MTAs.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5
service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: MTA

+--------------------------+
| File name  | Version     | 
+--------------------------+
| Emsmta.exe | 5.5.2654.39 | 
+--------------------------+



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the order of the bindings to ensure that the
binding that the MTA needs to use is the first in the list. In Microsoft Windows
NT 4.0, you can gain access to the bindings in Control Panel, in the Network
icon.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs because the MTA incorrectly uses code that is intended for
use on cluster servers. The MTA does not use additional bindings on cluster
servers to ensure that the MTA does not use the binding between the two
clusters.
