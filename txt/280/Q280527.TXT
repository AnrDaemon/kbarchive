SUMMARY
=======

An event ID 1016 message is not logged in the Application event log when you
access another user's mailbox or schedule if a primary Windows NT account has
not been assigned to that user's mailbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you try to access another user's mailbox or schedule, the following event
ID is logged in the Application event log:

   Event ID: 1016
   Source: MSExchangeIS Private
   Type: Success Audit
   Category: Logons
   Windows NT User <DOMAIN\username> logged on to UserA mailbox, and is not
   the primary Windows NT account on this mailbox.

This event is logged even if you have been granted permission to access the
mailbox, and even when you successfully access the mailbox. However, this event
is not logged if a primary Windows NT account is not assigned to the user's
mailbox. This behavior is by design.
