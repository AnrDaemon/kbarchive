======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The session properties page for a TN3270 Logical Unit (LU) allows the LU to be
configured for a port other than the default of 23. If the session is configured
for a type of "Display," the connection works as expected. If the session is
configured for a type of "Printer," the session connects only if it is set to
use the default port. If the TN3270 server is set for another port, a printer
session will connect on that, and only that, configured port.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design.

In Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000, which is the successor to Microsoft SNA
Server, the option to choose another port is unavailable (gray) if a type of
Printer is selected.
