TITLE   :PRB: _VFP.DataToClip() Only Reads DataSession 1
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600 kbXBase kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The DataToClip() method is not able to access data in a private data session.

CAUSE
=====

Because DataToClip is associated with the Application Object (_VFP), it only has
access to the data in the Object's DataSession, which is DataSession 1.

RESOLUTION
==========

One workaround is to write a routine that converts each field to character type
(the Transform() function does this easily in Visual FoxPro 6.0), concatenates
the information, and stores it to the _CLIPTEXT variable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

To display this behavior, paste the following code in a .prg file and run it:

   CLOSE DATA ALL
   _CLIPTEXT = ""

   loForm = CREATEOBJECT("MyDSForm")
   MESSAGEBOX(_CLIPTEXT)

   DEFINE CLASS MyDSForm AS form
      DataSession = 2
      
      PROCEDURE Init
         USE HOME() + "labels"
         
         *!* Because we did "CLOSE DATA ALL" at the top of the program,
         *!* there is no data in the default session to read.
         _VFP.DataToClip()
         
         *!* If you uncomment the next line, you will receive an error.
         *!*   _VFP.DataToClip("labels", 100)
      ENDproc
   ENDdefine
