======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SMS_LOGON_DISCOVERY_AGENT does not start on a Microsoft Windows 2000-based
domain controller if the default domain controller policy is disabled and
replaced by a different policy.

Although the service is installed, it cannot be started. The Nt_logon.log file
contains an entry that indicates that the service did not start because of error
1069. Manually trying to start the service from Control Panel does not work.

CAUSE
=====

SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANGER, which is responsible for the
SMS_LOGON_DISCOVERY_AGENT service installation, creates the SMS Remote Service
account (SMSLogonSvc) and attempts to add the "Logon on as a service" user right
for the account only to the domain controller's default policy object. However,
in this case, this is not the active policy. Therefore, the account lacks the
appropriate rights and cannot log on.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, manually add the "Logon on as a service" user right
to the domain controller's currently active policy.
