TITLE   :Cannot See or Move the Detail Bar in Health Monitor
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui BoS2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open the Health Monitor in System Management Server (SMS) version 2.0
on a Windows 2000-based server, or when you open the Health Monitor snap-in in
Microsoft BackOffice Server (BOS) or the Microsoft Small Business Server (SBS)
Administrator Console, the Details title bar may not be visible and you are not
able to expand or contract the individual title bars.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) does not
automatically refresh itself.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, click the Resize button in the top right corner of
the window, and then maximize the screen again. This resizes the ASP portion of
the window and you can then see the Details title bar, and you can expand or
contact the individual title bars.
