SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a file or folder on the desktop after you have set the NoDrives
policy, Explorer may stop responding (hang), and you may receive a stack
overflow error message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if Explorer receives two notifications that files or
folders are created on or removed from the desktop while the NoDrives policy is
in effect. Under these conditions, Explorer stops responding when it tries to
update the folder tree.
