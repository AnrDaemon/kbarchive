The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Change Case command may not change the selection to Sentence case or Title
Case in the following conditions.

Case 1
------

The Change Case command (SHIFT+F3) does not change to Title Case when either of
the following conditions is true:

 - The selection includes an end-of-sentence punctuation (such as a period,
   question mark, or exclamation mark). Word changes from UPPERCASE to lowercase
   to Sentence case only.

   -or-

 - The selection begins with a space. Word changes from UPPERCASE to lowercase
   to Sentence case only.

Case 2
------

The Change Case command does not change to Sentence case when either of the
following conditions is true:

 - The selection does not include the end-of-sentence punctuation. Word changes
   from UPPERCASE to lowercase to Title Case only.

   -or-

 - The selection of an incomplete sentence includes the last letter in the
   paragraph but does not include end-of-sentence punctuation. Word changes from
   UPPERCASE to lowercase to Title Case only.

CAUSE
=====

The Change Case command does not change a complete sentence to Title Case.
Similarly, the Change Case command assumes that a non-sentence selection is
never formatted for Sentence case. The command determines whether the selection
is a sentence by checking for end-of-sentence punctuation. This feature is by
design of the SHIFT+F3 key combination for the Change Case command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Change Case command changes selected characters to all uppercase letters,
all lowercase letters, or a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters. The
Change Case command affects character capitalization but not character
formatting, such as Small Caps or All Caps. For example, if you apply Title case
to text that already has Small Caps format, the first letter of each word
becomes an uppercase letter while the rest of the characters retain the Small
Caps format.

Sentence case          Capitalizes the first letter of the first word in
                          the selected sentence, or the first word after
                          the end of a sentence.

lowercase              Changes selected text to all lowercase letters.

UPPERCASE              Changes selected text to all uppercase letters.

Title Case             Capitalizes the first letter of each word in the
                          selection.

tOGGLE cASE            Changes all uppercase letters to lowercase
                          letters and all lowercase letters to uppercase
                          letters in the selection.

cASE, and then click OK.
