OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbClient kbConfig kbSecurity kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a network that has a large number of domains, Microsoft Windows 95- and
Windows 98-based client computers may not install the SMS client software. The
client installation process may stop responding before the core components are
installed.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur when more than 32 client connection accounts have been
defined for the installation of the client software.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, reduce the number of client connection accounts. To
do this, create only a few accounts in the master domain and add them to any
resource domains where the clients reside.
