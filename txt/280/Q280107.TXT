TITLE   :MMC Shows "Unknown" Status When You Load Multiple ISAPI Filters
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbiis400

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A global Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) filter is
loaded at the server level in the Internet Information Server (IIS) Snap-in.
Although a global ISAPI filter can only be loaded once, it performs its intended
function on every site that the server hosts.

Alternately, ISAPI filters can be loaded for each site individually. Although
this method is discouraged, it can be accomplished and function without any
problems except that the IIS 4.0 Snap-in does not display the correct status in
the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). After the ISAPI filter is loaded for the
first Web site, the status of the ISAPI filter is displayed as "Unknown" for
each subsequent load, even though the filter functions for every site that it is
loaded for.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in IIS 5.0.
