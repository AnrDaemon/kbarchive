SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to replace missing system and TrueType fonts. This
may be useful in a situation where system or TrueType fonts are missing, and you
want to replace them but you do not want to run a repair installation of the
operating system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM is required to install system fonts. To install
TrueType fonts you can use either the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM or a network share
to the Fonts folder on another Windows NT-based computer.

To replace missing system and TrueType fonts:

1. Create a folder that is named "Fonts" (without the quotation marks) on drive
   C.

2. At a command prompt, change to the i386 folder on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM.

3. Use the "expand" (without the quotation marks) command to expand the fonts
   from the CD-ROM into the Fonts folder by running the "expand -r *.fo_
   c:\fonts" (without the quotation marks) command. To expand TrueType fonts,
   use the "expand -r *.tt_ c:\fonts" (without the quotation marks) command. You
   can also install TrueType fonts from another computer across the network, by
   using a mapped network drive to connect to the Fonts folder on another
   computer.

4. In Windows NT Explorer, click the c:\WINNT\Fonts folder, and then click
   Install New Font on the File menu.

5. Open the c:\Fonts folder, and then double click this folder to load the font
   list. After the fonts are discovered by the Add Fonts tool, choose the font
   or fonts you want to install, and then click OK.

   The fonts should now be successfully installed. It may appear that duplicate
   fonts are in the Fonts folder, however, only one instance of the font appears
   in programs where you can choose fonts.
