MORE INFORMATION
================

The WebDAV protocol defines facilities for adding properties to Web resources.
These properties consist of name or value pairs that are interchanged by using
XML. The protocol includes the PROPFIND method for accessing properties and the
PROPPATCH method for updating and removing properties.

Web properties are used in distributed authoring environments to provide for
efficient discovery and management of resources. For example, a subject property
can allow the indexing of all resources by their subject, and an author property
can allow for the discovery of which authors have written which documents.
