TITLE   :SMS: Mouse and Keyboard May Not Work in Remote Control Session
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0,2.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Windows XP Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are in a Systems Management Server (SMS) Remote Control session to a
Windows XP-based client, your mouse and keyboard may not function in the remote
control session, but you may be able to see screen refreshes.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by the start of a Windows XP Remote Desktop session
to the client computer. When the Remote Desktop session connects, it switches
the current user context on the client computer. SMS is unable to handle this
context switch, and loses mouse and keyboard functionality.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Wait for the Remote Desktop session to end, and then reconnect with the SMS
   Remote Control feature.

 - Use Windows XP Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance as the remote solution
   for Windows XP-based computers.

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server version
2.0.
