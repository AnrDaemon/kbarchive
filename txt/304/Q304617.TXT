SYMPTOMS
========

If Password Synchronization and Services for Macintosh are installed on the same
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6-based computer, Password Synchronization
may not start.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue, use Registry Editor to locate the following registry
key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Control/SeviceGroupOrder

Change the order of the groups so that the "PNP_TDI" group is after the
"StreamsDrivers" and "NDIS" groups.
