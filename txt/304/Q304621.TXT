TITLE   :Read Access to Hidden Files on NTFS Partition Seems to Be Lost
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.0,2.1 OEM Only
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, versions 2.0, 2.1 OEM Only 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can mark files on a partition that uses the NTFS file system as hidden by
setting the Hidden attribute (for example, by using the "attrib +h myfile.txt"
command). If you set a file's Hidden attribute on an NTFS partition, read access
to the file from NTFS may seem to be lost.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because a logic error causes Server for NFS to parse the
permissions incorrectly.
