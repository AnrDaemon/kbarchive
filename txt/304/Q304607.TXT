TITLE   :PRB: Visual Basic Doesn't Load .ocx When Starting Visual Basic
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a new Visual Basic 6.0 project (such as a Standard EXE
project), you receive the following error message:

   Failed to load control image list mscomctl.ocx

When you click Continue in the dialog box, the Visual Basic integrated
development environment (IDE) closes the application.

CAUSE
=====

When the Visual Basic IDE is being loaded, the control image list file
Mscomctl.ocx does not load. This problem can occur when the the default
temporary folder contains a large number of files (for example, more than 65,000
files).

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete all temporary files in the default temporary file folder.

To locate your default temporary files, and then delete them, follow these
steps:

1. On the Start menu, click Run.

2. In the Run dialog box, type "%TEMP%" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click OK.

3. A window opens that displays your temporary files; select the files you want
   to delete.

4. Press the DELETE key, click Yes to confirm the deletion, and then close the
   Temp window.

NOTE: You may receive a warning that any files that another program uses will not
be deleted until you close the program that uses these files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Other files also may not load when Visual Basic IDE is being loaded, depending
on the available space in the %Temp% folder.
