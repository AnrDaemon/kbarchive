TITLE   :Veritas Storage Replicator 2.1 for Windows NT Causes a Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a server with Veritas Storage Replicator 2.1 installed and a high network
load, the server may seem to stop responding (hang) although you can still move
the mouse pointer. If you press CTRL+ALT+DELETE, the screen may go blank. When
this issue occurs, the server still responds to ping commands, but is not
accessible from the network for any resources.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because two process threads loop by waiting for each other to
release a resource that is owned by the other thread.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you face similar issues contact Veritas for a fix or a workaround.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you cannot install an update from Veritas, you can remove the drivers or
program until you can install the update.
