SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Delete Package Wizard to delete a package, the Advertisements
screen displays all advertisements that are associated with the package you want
to delete. However, this screen may incorrectly display a Never value for the
Expires after column, even if the advertisement is set to expire or has already
expired.

WORKAROUND
==========

Although the Expires after value may be incorrect, the package and advertisement
deletion process will not be affected. You may safely ignore the Expires after
value and proceed normally with the Delete Package Wizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
