The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) logon and Active Server Pages (ASP) pages may
not be functional after you upgrade your operating system from Microsoft Windows
NT Server 4.0 to Microsoft Windows 2000 Server. All ASP pages return the
following error message:

   403.1 - Forbidden: Execute Access Forbidden.

CAUSE
=====

The script mappings for .asp were not modified during the upgrade process to
include the verb GET.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, make sure that the verb GET is listed for the ASP
script mapping. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In the Internet Server Manager, right-click the computer icon and click
   Properties. Under Master Properties, click WWW Service and click Edit.

2. Click the Home Directory tab and click Configuration.

This is where all the mapped extensions that are recognized by IIS are listed.
The verb GET should be listed for the .asp mapping. If it is missing, you
receive the "Execute Access Forbidden" error message.

To add the verb GET to the mapping for .asp, follow these steps:

1. Select the .asp extension, then click Edit.

2. In the Limit To field, ensure that GET, HEAD, POST, and TRACE are listed.

3. Click OK until all property windows are closed. If you are prompted, select
   all of the nodes for which you want this setting to apply.
