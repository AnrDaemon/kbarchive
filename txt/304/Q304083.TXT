======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) to try to remove a user from an
instance of a recurring appointment item, and then try to send an update to that
user alone by changing the status to "CdoMeetingCanceled," all of the users may
be notified. The code works correctly on a non-recurring appointment item.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
