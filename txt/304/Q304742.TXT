PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6a

SYMPTOMS
========

After you shut down your computer remotely (by using the Shutdown.exe tool or a
similar tool) while a password-protected screensaver is active, you may receive
the following Event 6008 entry in the Event log:

   The previous system shutdown at time on date was unexpected.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if Winlogon does not log off the user, and because of
this, the screensaver continues. After this occurs, a proper shutdown is not
initiated.
