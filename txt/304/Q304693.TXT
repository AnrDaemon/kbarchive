The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer that is running Windows NT 4.0, event ID 644 may be logged in the
Security event log. Event ID 644 indicates that a user account is locked. This
event may be logged even if you do not have auditing enabled.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the computer does not verify if auditing is enabled
before it logs the event.

STATUS
======

This behavior is resolved in versions of Windows that are later than Windows NT
4.0, including Microsoft Windows 2000.
