TITLE   :IIS: Problems Using SSL with AuthentiX ISAPI Filter
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::3.0,4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are browsing with Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.0 or later and
you have Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enabled while you are using a Flicks
Software AuthentiX Internet Server API (ISAPI) filter, you may receive the
following error message:

   Page Cannot Be Displayed

CAUSE
=====

Normally AuthentiX sends a Pragma: no-cache header with each file that is served
in a cookie-protected folder; if you have cookie timeouts set, this ensures that
a page is not cached in the browser and is not available for viewing after the
timeout has expired. When you attempt to download a file with SSL and Internet
Explorer, the Pragma: no-cache header causes an error.

NOTE: With SSL, the default setting for all browsers is not to cache pages from
SSL encrypted sites, so the Pragma: no-cache header is unnecessary.

WORKAROUND
==========

To turn off Pragma: no-cache headers, follow these steps:

1. In the registry, add the following REG_DWORD value with the name
   CookieStopNoCache. Set its value to 1 to stop the Pragma: no-cache headers.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Flicks Software/AuthentiX/1.0/AuthentiXConfig

NOTE: If you want to stop the Cache-Control: private header, use
CookieStopPrivate. If you want to stop Expires: 0, use CookieStopExpires.

2. Use Control Panel to stop and restart the IIS Admin Service (if you are
   running IIS versions 4.0 or 5.0) or the World Wide Web Publishing Service (if
   you are running IIS 3.0).
