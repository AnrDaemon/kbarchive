OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.1 
 - Microsoft Windows XP Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure the properties of a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) virtual
server, the buttons on the Security Accounts tab to add and remove operators are
unavailable. As a result, administrators are unable to add or remove users or
groups as site operators.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Professional SKUs of the Microsoft Windows operating system are intended as
