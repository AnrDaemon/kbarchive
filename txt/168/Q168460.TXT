TITLE   :SMS: "SMSEXEC.EXE - Lost Delayed-Write Data" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbMaintMan smsmaintman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Systems Management Server logon server is out of disk space when the
Maintenance Manager service attempts to write to its Domain.ini file during a
normal cycle, a dialog box appears on the Systems Management Server site server,
with the following message:

   SMSEXEC.EXE - Lost Delayed-Write Data:
   The system was attempting to transfer file data from buffers to
   <hex>\SERVER\VOLUME\SMS\logon.srv\DOMAIN._._. The write operation
   failed, and only some of the data may have been written to the file. saying
   essentially a "Lost delayed write occurred writing
   \\<server>\<vol>\SMS\LOGON.SRV\DOMAIN._N_...".

The Maintenance Manager thread will stop responding (as evidenced by no activity
in the Maintman.log), and .raw files will back up until you click OK.

CAUSE
=====

Maintenance Manager does not test for adequate disk space before attempting to
write to the files it maintains on the logon servers.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do either of the following:

 - Ensure that the Systems Management Server logon servers are properly
   maintained, and do not run out of disk space.

   -or-

 - Create adequate disk space on the Systems Management Server logon server,
   then click OK in the dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
