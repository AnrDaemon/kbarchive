PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, used with:
    - the hardware: DEC Alpha 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you open a WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS document in Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows on the Alpha platform, an Invalid Page Fault (IPF) may occur if the
document contains some types of graphics.

CAUSE
=====

The IPF occurs when the WordPerfect converter (WPFT532.CNV) calls the WPG export
filter (WPGEXP32.FLT).

NOTE: Microsoft Word 97 running on the Intel platform does not generate an IPF;
instead you get the following error message:

   Unable to convert graphic. Continue with document conversion?

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
