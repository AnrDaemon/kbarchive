SUMMARY
=======

When you run the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, for
troubleshooting purposes, you may need to back up and temporary clean up all
files (including .ccm and .und files) from the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Import, Export,
and Sumbit directories.

This article describes the process for replaying .ccm files from
Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Sumbit directory, which is the connector store. This will
prevent a loss of mail due to the .ccm files not being processed by the cc:Mail
Import.exe executable file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To replay CCM files:

1. Stop MSExchangeCCMC.

2. Copy the backup .ccm files to the Exchsrvr\Submit directory.

3. Make sure the Exchsrvr\Import and Exchsrvr\Export directories are empty.

4. Start MSExchangeCCMC

The message will be imported to the cc:Mail postoffice database. Do not copy
files with the .und extension. These are non-delivery messages that were
rejected by the cc:Mail import cycle.
