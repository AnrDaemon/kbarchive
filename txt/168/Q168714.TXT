TITLE   :XADM: Manager Field Incorrect After Import
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you import Manager field information to a mailbox Organization tab, the
Manager field displays an X.400 address similar to:

   /o=Microsoft/ou=SITENAME/cn=Recipients/cn=FirstName LastName

CAUSE
=====

When you import into Exchange Server using a .csv file to add the manager field
to mailboxes, you must specify the Alias Name of the user. Using the Display
Name of the user for the manager will result above scenario and direct reports
of that user will not be displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - When creating a .csv file for importing manager data, add the alias name of
   the user instead of display name in the manager field.

By adding the Alias Name, the imported manager information will properly show the
manager's Display Name and will display the manager's direct reports as well.
