PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbusage kbfield winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert an AutoText entry that contains a field, the field result is
automatically updated.

For example, if you insert an AutoText entry that contains a date field, the
current system date is inserted rather than the date that the AutoText entry was
created.

NOTE: This behavior is different from previous versions of Word.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. Word automatically updates the results of fields
when they are inserted as part of an AutoText entry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In earlier versions of Word, when you insert an AutoText entry that contains a
field, the result of the field is not updated automatically. To update the field
in the AutoText entry of an earlier version of Word, you must force Word to
update by selecting the field and pressing F9, by changing views, by printing
the file, or by using a macro.
