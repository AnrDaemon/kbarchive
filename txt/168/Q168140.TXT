TITLE   :XCON: NDR "Invalid Parameters"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:Windows:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a message originates from a third-party message transfer agent (MTA) by way
of an X.400 connection to the Microsoft Exchange MTA with an administrative
management domain (ADMD) that is a space, a non-delivery report (NDR) is
generated with the message text "invalid parameters."

CAUSE
=====

This happens because the MTA improperly handles a numeric ADMD. Many third-party
MTAs generate a numeric character 0 for a space rather then an alphanumeric
null. Microsoft Exchange Server properly supports this in all O/R address fields
but not in other parts of the message envelope (for example, MTSID,
Bilateral-Info, External and Internal-Trace-Info).

The Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 MTA does not properly handle the numeric ADMDs;
however, the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 MTA is able to properly distinguish
between numeric and alphanumeric ADMD fields.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, do one of the following:

 - Change the third-party ADMD to something other than a space.

   -Or-

 - Upgrade to Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
