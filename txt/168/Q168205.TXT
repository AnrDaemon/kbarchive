SUMMARY
=======

Some confusion may exist between the Optimistic Batch Update and the
BeginTrans/CommitTrans methods of updating databases. This article explains the
differences between the two methods.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Batch updates are used when you open a connection using the Optimistic (Client)
Batch cursor library. Each time the Update or UpdateRow method is used, the
rdoResultSet is cached locally but the main database remains unchanged. The
BatchUpdate method must be used to update the main database.

The BeginTrans/CommitTrans methods will cache the information on the database
server each time it's changed. When the CommitTrans method is used, the
information is permanently updated. If the RollBackTrans method is used, the new
data is discarded.

For optimization purposes, it is best to use the Batch update method when large
amounts of data are going to be changed all at once. This will send one large
burst of data across the network when the BatchUpdate method is called as
opposed to sending many small updates. For the same reason, it's best to use
BeginTrans/CommitTrans when updating smaller bits of data.
