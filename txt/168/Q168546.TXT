PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After upgrading SNA Server 3.0 with Service Pack 1, the SnaBase or SNA Server
service may fail unexpectedly with an access violation or SNA Server may
unexpectedly stop accepting new client connections. This problem can occur if
SNA clients are connecting to the server over MS Networking (named pipes) or
Netware IPX/SPX. A Drwtsn32.log entry may be generated when this failure occurs,
indicating a FAULT in the top-level routine along with the following stack-back
trace (which may vary):

 - snalm!QueueBuffer

   or

 - ntdll!RtlAllocateHeap
   snalm!GetReadBuffer
   snalm!AceptConnection
   snadmod!AcceptClientConnection
   snadmod!DMODServiceThread

   or

 - ntdll!RtlDestroyHeap
   ntdll!RtlFreeHeap
   snalm!CleanupConnection
   snalm!CloseConnection
   snadmod!CloseLtab
   snadmod!IoThread

   or

 - security!NtLmSspControl
   security!DeleteSecurityContext
   snalm!CleanupSecurityContext
   snalm!CloseConnection
   snadmod!sepdnhpe

If new clients cannot connect, the SNA Server or SnaBase internal trace may
indicate the following error after accepting a new client connection:

   ACCPT HeapAlloc failed, rc 0

CAUSE
=====

SnaBase or SNA Server memory local heap corruption is occurring within the IO
completion port handling of named pipe or IPX/SPX clients.

RESOLUTION
==========

The SNA Server has been updated to correct this problem.
