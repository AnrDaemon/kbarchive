SUMMARY
=======

The Puzzle Collection Trial Version consists of snippets of 3 games: Finty
Flush, Rat Poker, and Spring Weekend. You will be allowed to play the game for a
few levels, and then the game will stop. A higher level of the game will be
displayed, but the screen will be frozen and you will not be able to play the
game. A "tip" will appear, urging you to buy the retail version of The Puzzle
Collection.

Depending on which keyboard language you use, The Puzzle Collection will allow
you to install from one of seven different languages; however the trial version
is only available in English.

The trial version download will consist of one self-extracting executable (.exe)
file. Double-clicking .exe will launch a "flat" Setup that will install the
trial version to a chosen folder.

Collection, Trial Version:
