TITLE   :XADM: How to Import Manager Data into Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Organization property page may be used to enter optional information in the
Address Book about the mailbox owner's manager and direct reports (if any).

Manager information may be imported into the Exchange mailboxes by creating a
.Csv file that contains a Manager column header.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Create a .Csv file by exporting the addresses from the Administrator program and
modifying the file to add the new column "Manager" and Alias Name of the user
who will be listed as the manager for that mailbox.

Close, then import this modified .Csv file into Exchange, using Tools / Directory
Import command.

Any mailbox owner who is listed as a manager of another user will have Direct
Report information displayed within his or her mailbox properties.

Each recipient who reports to the mailbox owner (Manager) will be listed in the
Direct Reports dialog box of that mailbox owner.

REFERENCES
==========

The Exchange Server 4.0 CD contains a sample Mailbox.csv file that can be found
at:

   \SUPPORT\SAMPLES\Csvs\MAILBOX\Mailbox.csv

Contained in this file are all 93 fields that can be associated with any Exchange
Server mailbox. This .Csv file may be used to create the "master headers" for a
.Csv file for use in importing user and mailbox information into Exchange
Server.

The Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit contains a utility called Header.exe, which
can be used to create a .Csv file with only the required headers.
