SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Mail icon in Control Panel you may receive the following
error message:

   You need more memory or system resources. Close some windows and try
   again.

CAUSE

The Mapi.dll file, located in the Windows\System subdirectory by default, is
either missing, corrupted, or has been replaced by another version.


RESOLUTION
==========

1. Reinstall Microsoft Exchange Client.

2. Expand Mapi.dll from the Exchange Client cabinet (cab) files.

3. Copy Mapi.dll from another Windows computer that is currently working. Both
   computers must be running the same version and service pack of Exchange
   Client. See table below and compare the size of the Mapi.dll file to find out
   this information.
