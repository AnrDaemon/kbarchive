TITLE   :Have Disk Default Behavior Changed for Win95 Client Install
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install third-party Windows 95 drivers on a Windows NT 4.0 system, you
encounter difficulties setting up Point and Print.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur because of an incorrect .inf being used during setup. The
default behavior during the installation of third-party drivers is not to copy
the .inf file locally to ensure that a duplication of .inf files did not occur.
This caused Point and Print setup issues because Windows NT attempts to resolve
the model name in the local .inf before using an alternative source. Because the
.inf file was never copied, installation problems may result.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 4.0 For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
