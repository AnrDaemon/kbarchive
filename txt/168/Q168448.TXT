TITLE   :WD97: Batch Conversion Wizard Enters Endless Loop
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbusage winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Batch Conversion Wizard to convert a Word mail merge main
document, you will be unable to cancel the Open Data Source dialog box if Word
cannot locate the data source.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Visual Basic for Applications takes control from the
wizard and does not give the control back; in this situation, the Open Data
Source dialog box will not respond to the Cancel button.

WORKAROUND
==========

To get out of the loop, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Connect to Any Data Source
------------------------------------

Connect to any data source; although, this may cause some data field problems.
For information about how to address these problems, see the "More Information"
section of this article.

Method 2: Create a New Data Source
----------------------------------

Create a new data source file within Microsoft Word that contains the same mail
merge data fields. This file does not need to contain any data. Once the file
has been created, open it as the data source when running the Wizard.

Method 3: Force Word to Close
-----------------------------

Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to bring up the Close Program dialog box and then press End
Task for Microsoft Word. You may have to press End Task a second time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
