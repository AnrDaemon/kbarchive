KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbvfp kbvfp500aFIX kbvfp500bugkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running the PivotTable Wizard from Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 5.0, if
Excel 97 is installed, you will receive the following error:

   Could Not Locate Microsoft Excel

CAUSE
=====

The PivotTable Wizard was failing with Excel 97 because it could not find the
application path. This was a general problem with the Wizard if Excel was
located in a long-file named path such as \Program Files\Office\Excel.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Microsoft Visual
FoxPro version 5.0a for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

With Microsoft Excel 97 installed to a long file-named path:

1. Run Microsoft Visual FoxPro 5.0.

2. Open a database.

3. From the Tools menu, select Wizards and click PivotTable.

This returns the error "Could Not Locate Microsoft Excel."

NOTE: In order for the PivotTable Wizard to work, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft
Query should already be installed.
