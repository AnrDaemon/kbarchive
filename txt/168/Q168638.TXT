TITLE   :PPT7: No Action or Interactive Settings for Grouped Shapes
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbdraw

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you group several objects together, the Action Settings command on the Slide
Show menu is unavailable (dimmed). If you right-click a group of objects, the
Action Settings command is unavailable on the menu that appears.

In addition, if you group an object that has an action setting or interactive
setting property with other objects, PowerPoint ignores those settings until you
ungroup the object.

CAUSE
=====

Although multiple objects that have been grouped together behave as though they
are a single object with respect to being moved, sized, or copied, PowerPoint
remembers that the group is made up of multiple objects. PowerPoint cannot apply
or activate action settings or interactive settings to multiple objects
simultaneously, so it disables these commands when you select a grouped object
or multiple objects.

RESOLUTION
==========

To apply action settings or interactive settings to a group of objects, first
convert the group of objects to a single picture. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Select the group of objects.

2. On the Edit menu, click Cut.

3. On the Edit menu, click Paste Special.

4. In the Paste Special dialog box, click Picture or click Picture (Enhanced
   Metafile).

5. Click OK.

You can now apply action settings or interactive settings to the picture.

STATUS
======

This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
release.
