======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you export a makefile in Visual C++ 5.0, each project is written to a
separate makefile. This means that subprojects of a project are built using
separate makefiles.

RESOLUTION
==========

This should not negatively impact builds. The makefile for the parent project
invokes NMAKE to build the subprojects. There is no way to force Developer
Studio to write a single makefile for all projects in the build.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Visual C++ 4.x, a parent project and its subprojects were written to the same
makefile. In Visual C++ 5.0, you must manually export a makefile and each
project is written to a separate makefile. The only way this should impact
builds is that you are responsible for exporting all makefiles needed for a
build. The makefile for a parent project contains commands to invoke NMAKE to
build its subprojects. If all of the makefiles needed are present, the build
executes as expected.

You do not need to change how you invoke NMAKE, nor do you need to invoke NMAKE
separately for the subprojects. The parent project should invoke NMAKE for any
subprojects that need to be built.
