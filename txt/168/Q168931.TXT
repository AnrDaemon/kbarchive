TITLE   :Err Msg: Setup Was Unable to Verify Your <X>: Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetupkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Windows NT 4.0 Setup from the three boot floppy disks, you
may receive the following error message on the third disk when Setup performs a
check of your hard disks:

   Setup was unable to verify your <X> drive

where <X> is C: or D: depending on your configuration.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs if Autochk.exe cannot check the drive or cannot be loaded. Most
likely, Windows NT Setup detected a CD-ROM drive but could not read from it.
Because this is not a fatal error, you can continue, but you may have problems
copying the files from your CD-ROM drive. This can also lead you to believe that
your hard disk is damaged, but may be just a bad CD- ROM or failing CD-ROM drive
or controller.


RESOLUTION
==========

If the message occurs because of a CD-ROM that cannot be read, try the following
steps to work around the problem:

1. For a drive using the FAT file system, copy the I386 folder to the hard disk
   and then install from the hard disk using the WINNT /B command.

2. For a drive using the NTFS file system, try replacing the CD-ROM, the CD-ROM
   drive, or the CD-ROM controller.
