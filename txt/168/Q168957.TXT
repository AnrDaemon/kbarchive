TITLE   :FIX: C1001, file 'msc1.cpp', line 1188, Caused by Name Hiding
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode kbtool kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbLangCPP kbVC kbVC500bug kbVS97sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Name hiding caused by similar-named variables and user-defined types in the same
scope may cause the compiler to generate the following error:

   C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
   (compiler file 'msc1.cpp', line 1188)

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the elaborated type specifier to name the user-defined type. For example,
use "class a::b" instead of "b" to identify the class b nested in class a.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
