TITLE   :Dr Watson Exception Violation C0000005 Occurs After Install SP3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 you may get a Dr. Watson error
in Spools.exe and Services.exe. The error message occurs after you log on to the
computer. It can also cause the system to stop responding before logging on.
This, and several other error messages, can be attributed to Starfish Internet
monitoring agent that installs a file called Nmsocknt.dll.

CAUSE
=====

Nmsocknt.dll makes calls to User32.dll, Kernel32.dll, and Wsock32.dll that
effectively stops all networking services.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename the Nmsocknt.dll found in the %SystemRoot% directory to Nmsocknt.xxx. You
must perform this at a command prompt because Windows NT Explorer will display
an access violation. Then shutdown and restart your Windows NT computer to
resume normal operation.
