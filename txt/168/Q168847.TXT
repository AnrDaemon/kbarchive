======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows 95, when you use the debugger to attach to a console application that
is waiting for user input, you may get the following error message:

   DM0025: Error attaching to process.

CAUSE
=====

The debugger times out while waiting for the console application. This problem
only occurs on Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following steps use the Test sample provided in the MORE INFORMATION section
of this article.

1. Start the Test application from Developer Studio or from Windows Explorer.
   The Test application will display "Start process" and wait for data entry.

2. In Developer Studio, click Start Debug from the Build menu.

3. Click "Attach to Process...". In the Attach to Process dialog box, click the
   Test process and click OK. Immediately click the application's icon on the
   Task Bar to activate the Application's window. You may now see the debugger
   displaying assembly code in Developer Studio with the application loaded in
   the workspace as if it is ready to debug.

4. Open the test.cpp file in Developer Studio. Set a breakpoint in the line of
   code as indicated below. At this point if you click the Debug menu, you can
   only choose "Stop Debugging" or "Break". If you select "Break," you get the
   following message with an "OK" button:

   All threads are in system calls. It is not possible to break into the
   debugger at this time.

5. Enter a character followed by the Enter key. The breakpoint is hit and you
   can debug the application now.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a console project called Test and add the following source file:

   // File name test.cpp
   #include <iostream.h>

   void  main()
   {
       char ch;

       cout << "Start process" << endl;
       cin >> ch;

       cout << "Start debugging" << endl; //SET A BREAKPOINT HERE

       // Body of code would be here.
   }

2. Build the project for debug mode.

3. Start the application from developer Studio or from Windows Explorer.

4. In Developer Studio, click Start Debug from the Build menu. Click "Attach to
   Process...". In the Attach to Process dialog box, click the Test process and
   click OK. The hour glass icon appears for a while followed by the error
   message described in the SYMPTOMS section. Note that the error message does
   not appear immediately.
