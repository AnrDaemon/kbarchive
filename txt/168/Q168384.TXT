TITLE   :PRB: C2248: No Access for Friend Class in a Template Class

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Declaring a template parameter type as a friend class of a template class,
causes the compiler error C2248:

   error C2248: 'xx' : cannot access private member declared in class
   'XX<class T>'

Member access is not granted to friend class T, where T is a template parameter
of the template class XX.

CAUSE
=====

The compiler treats typename T as a regular C++ class and not a template
parameter type. This implies the following:

 - typename T, where T is a template parameter type is not granted access to
   private members of the template class.

 - A regular C++ class named class T is granted access to private members of the
   template class.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not declare a template parameter type as a friend of a template class.
Specify the friend class using the regular C++ class name.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design as per C++ standard section 7.1.5.3 paragraph 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code demonstrates the problem.

Sample Code
-----------

     /*
      * Compiler Options: none
      */ 

      template <typename T>
      class Test
      {
         //template parameter T declared as friend class
         friend class T ;
         int m_i ;
      } ;

      class B
      {
      public:
         //Cannot access private member of template class Test
         //since class B is not recognized as friend class of
         //template class Test
         B() { tB.m_i = 0 ;} //C2248 here
         Test<B> tB ;
      } ;

      int main()
      {
         B bObj ;
         return 0 ;
      }
