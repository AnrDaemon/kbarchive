======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Standard C++ Library, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to pass an __int64 variable to the ostream operator <<, you get
the following error:

   error C2593: 'operator <<' is ambiguous

CAUSE
=====

There is no operator << for __int64 type defined for the ostream class.

RESOLUTION
==========

Define your own version of operator <<. The following sample code section
shows a simple solution for << operator that converts the __int64 variable
to a char * type and passes it to the ostream << operator.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample program demonstrates the problem and workaround:

   //Sample.cpp
   // Compiler Options : /GX

   //#define WORKAROUND   //Uncomment this line to workaround

   #include<iostream>
   using namespace std;

   #ifdef WORKAROUND
   std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, __int64 i )
   {
       char buf[20];
       sprintf(buf,"%I64d", i );
       os << buf;
       return os;
   }

   #endif

   int main(){
   __int64  i64;

   cout << i64 ;

   return 0;
   }
