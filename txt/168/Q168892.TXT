TITLE   :XCON: MTA Reports Failure on Ecbios.dll During Startup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA), the
following error message may appear:

   The dynamic link library Ecbios.dll could not be found in the specified
   path.

The Windows NT Application log shows the following error:

   Event ID: 9106
   Source:MSExchangeMTA
   Category: Field Engineering
   An internal MTA error occurred. The X.25 interface failed to initialize.
   Check to make sure the X.25 card is started. (14)

The MTA starts after the error and appears functional.

CAUSE
=====

The above error means that during the MTA initialization it could not initialize
the Eicon X.25 card.

This means that either the Eicon X.25 driver is not properly installed or there
is a problem with the installed driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - Reinstall the Eicon driver and the WAN Services for Windows NT software.

This problem most often occurs after you perform an Exchange Server Disaster
Recovery on a computer without first installing the Eicon software if the X.25
card was being used on an X.400 connector.

Additional query words: x25 restore recovery 2140 x400
