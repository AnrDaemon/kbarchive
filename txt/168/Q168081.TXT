   c:\program files\devstudio\sharedide\macros\mymacro.dsm This macro file
   contained the following error and will be unloaded Line 6: Expected ')' if

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. From the Tools menu, select Macro

2. Enter "finder" as the Macro Name (excluding the quotes).

3. Click Edit.

4. In the Add Macro dialog box, click OK.

5. Insert the following code into the body of the finder() subroutine:

      if (ActiveDocument.selection.FindText "CWnd") then
         msgbox "Found!"
      end if

   The finder() subroutine should look like this:

      Sub finder()
      'DESCRIPTION: A description was not provided.
         if (ActiveDocument.selection.FindText "CWnd") then
            msgbox "Found!"
         end if
         'TODO: Put macro code here
      End Sub

6. From the macro editor's context menu, select Reload Macro File to reproduce
   the error message.
