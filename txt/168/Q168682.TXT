-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article documents the usage of Sendcode.exe, available on the Microsoft
Systems Management Server 1.2 CD in the Support\Debug\<platform>
directory. This tool is provided to assist in diagnosing Systems Management
Server service problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can trigger the Systems Management Server site services to do a specific
task by sending a service control code using the Sendcode.exe utility program.
The syntax of the command is:

      sendcode sms_service_name <svcode>

For example, to trigger a normal watchdog cycle in SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER, run:

      sendcode SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER 192

The following service codes are accepted:

      128 - Starts memory allocation tracking.
      129 - Stops memory allocation tracking.
      130 - Dumps all the memory allocation data to the Alerter.mem,
            Appmgr.mem, Hman.mem, Scmanmem.log, Sched.mem, and Smsexec.mem
            files in the root directory.
      132 - Toggles the net pause support on and off.
      192 - Initiates a normal watchdog cycle (verifies the current
            installation, checks for new Systems Management Server logon
            servers, restarts any stopped components, and so on).
      193 - Initiates a watchdog cycle and writes a status (.ct2) file.
      194 - Initiates a watchdog cycle but treats it as an upgrade. To be
            most effective, shut down and restart the computer before issuing
            this command.
      195 - Initiates a watchdog cycle and writes a user group MIF file.
      196 - Initiates a watchdog cycle and modifies logon scripts only if the
            Automatically Configure Workstation Logon Scripts and Use All
            Detected Servers options are enabled.


The following table shows which Systems Management Server services support which
codes:
