The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

During Windows NT setup the 3C589D EtherLink III PC Card is not recognized. This
inhibits you from joining a domain because the network cannot be started.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the 3c589D is not on the Windows NT version 4.0 Hardware Compatibility
List (HCL) the tuple information for this PC Card is not in the Windows NT
Registry Database. To add support for this card during Windows NT Setup, perform
the following:

1. Copy the \i386 directory from the Windows NT Installation CD to your
   distribution share point or local hard drive.

2. From a computer running Windows NT, uncompress the System._ file in the \i386
   directory. IE: EXPAND System._ System

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

3. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and select the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   Window.

4. Select the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key.

5. On the Registry menu, click Load Hive. Browse to and select the SYSTEM
   registry file in the Windows NT distribution \I386 directory. Click Open,
   then assign it a name other than SYSTEM, for example, TEST.

6. The newly loaded hive will now appear in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE window as
   TEST. Double-click on the folder TEST, and then ControlSet001.

7. Use the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article to add 3Com 3C589D entries
   to the PCMCIA database.

   Q138618 ErrMsg: "No Configuration Info ..." with PCMCIA

8. When finished, select the TEST key, then from the Registry menu, click Unload
   Hive.

9. Rename the System. file to System._ in the Distribution directory.

10. Run Windows NT Setup, winnt or winnt /B from the distribution directory.
