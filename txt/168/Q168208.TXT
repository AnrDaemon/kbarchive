TITLE   :FIX: StillExecuting Is True After Async Execution Completes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The StillExecuting property of a Connection or a QueryDef object will
incorrectly remain True even after successfully completing an asynchronous
operation. This does not occur with Recordset objects.

RESOLUTION
==========

While the StillExecuting property of the Connection and QueryDef objects will
incorrectly return a True the first time it is read after the asynchronous
operation has completed, further tests of the StillExecuting property will
return a False. Testing the StillExecuting property inside of a While loop will
work. After the operation has completed, the While loop will run through one
more cycle where StillExecuting will return a True, after which it will
correctly return a False.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 3.
