SUMMARY
=======

When you install the Microsoft Cluster Service (MSCS), the default cluster group
that is created contains an IP address and Network Name (Cluster Name) for
cluster administration. In Windows 2000 and beyond it will also put the physical
disk resource that is used as the Quorum disk in the cluster group as well.
Additional resources should not be added to this group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Cluster Group contains resources related to cluster administration only. If
you add additional resources to the group, the ability to administer the cluster
may be hindered. Failure of any additional resources within the Cluster Group
may trigger failover or inability to successfully administer the cluster.

For best results and higher availability of the cluster, do not add resources to
the cluster group. Instead, create groups for the additional resources, or place
the resources in other groups within the cluster.

Additional query words: MSCS W2000MSCS
