KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========


In Performance Monitor, the counters for the MSExchangePCMTA object may show
values of zero, even though mail is flowing through the MSMail Connector to the
PCMTA. This will occur if you are logged in as an account that is not in the
Administrators Group.

==========

To work around this problem:

 - In order to view the correct values of these counters, log in as
   Administrator or with an account that is part of the Administrators Group.

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
