SUMMARY
=======

There may be occasions when you need to print a message without headers (that
is, the To, Cc, Bcc, or Subject field). For example, you may want to print a
message without printing its large recipient list. This is not a feature of
Microsoft Exchange Client. The following steps describe how to print a message
without the headers using WordMail as the default e-mail editor.

MORE INFORMATION

With WordMail as the e-mail editor:

1. Open the message (in WordMail).

2. Press Ctrl+A on the keyboard to select the entire message (or, on the Edit
   menu, click Select All).

3. On the File menu, click Print and then click Current Selection.

4. Click OK.
