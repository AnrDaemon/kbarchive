TITLE   :XCON: X.400 Exchange Interop with Foreign MTA Causing NDR
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:Platform:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When sending messages using an X.400 Connector from a foreign message transfer
agent (MTA) to an Exchange Server MTA with an ADMD= " " (Space), a non-delivery
report (NDR) will be generated which refers to invalid parameters.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of the way Exchange Server MTA handles numeric ADMD
(Administrative management domain name).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Exchange Server supports this properly in all originator/recipient address
fields but not in other parts of the envelope (for example, MTSID,
Bilateral-Info, External, and Internal-Trace- Info).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, do not use a space or numeric name for the Exchange
Server MTA when connecting with foreign MTAs.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Exchange Server 4.0.

This bug was corrected in Exchange Server 5.0.
