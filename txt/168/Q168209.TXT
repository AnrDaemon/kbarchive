TITLE   :PRB: QueryDef dbFailOnError Doesn't Rollback on Failure
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changes made to the database are not rolled back when an Execute operation
fails, even when using the dbFailOnError option. The dbFailonError, when used
with the Execute method, would roll back any updates if an error occurred. With
the QueryDef.Execute method, this is no longer true.

CAUSE
=====

Because using the Execute method with dbFailOnError does not do an implicit
transaction, changes made to a database will not be rolled back when it
encounters an error.

RESOLUTION
==========

The fastest way to do a bulk query is without an implicit transaction and by
explicitly calling BeginTrans/CommitTrans.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In previous releases of Data Access Objects (DAO), if you executed SQL
statements they were internally treated as transactions. If you executed a
statement with the dbFailOnError flag on and the query failed, the operation was
rolled back. For performance reasons, an SQL statement is no longer treated as a
transaction. Therefore, if an SQL query fails in Microsoft Access, an incomplete
operation may occur. If you think an error may occur, you should explicitly use
the statement within a transaction by using the BeginTrans method and the
CommitTrans method. However, note that explicit transactions may slow query
performance.
