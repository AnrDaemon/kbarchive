======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0a, 6.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When saving a form or a menu to a Novell server from a Windows NT 4.0 computer
running Novell IntranetWare Client 4.1, an erroneous message may occur:

   "File ... is read-only."

MORE INFORMATION
================

IntranetWare 4.1 is the 32-bit client for Windows NT computers. The behavior is
usually seen using this client on Windows NT 4.0 computers. The behavior has not
been observed on a Windows NT 3.51 computer (with Service Pack 5).

The problem appears to occur mainly when saving writeable Form or Menu files that
are within a project, although the behavior has also been observed with
stand-alone files. In some cases, the behavior is more evident on Windows NT 4.0
computers that have Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 4 installed.

The problem appears to be intermittent when saving forms but occurs most when
saving menus a second time. Other file types may exhibit the same behavior.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On a Windows NT 4.0 computer with Service Pack 2 installed using the Novell
   IntranetWare 4.1 client, create a project on the Novell server.

2. In the project, create a menu that has a Result of "Submenu" but which has no
   submenu, and save it.

3. Modify the menu and attempt to save it. The error should occur when
   attempting to save the menu.

NOTE: The behavior does not occur when "Command" is selected as the menu item
result and a valid command is entered. The ReadOnly dialog appears
intermittently when saving forms.
