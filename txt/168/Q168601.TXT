PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0; winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create custom dialog boxes using the Custom Dialog Editor, when the
installation runs after the first dialog box is displayed, subsequent dialog
boxes are made the same size, even if their overall size is smaller or larger.

CAUSE
=====

The Custom Dialog Editor is a wizard that creates dialog boxes that share common
characteristics. This includes size and common controls like the Back, Next, and
Cancel buttons. If you have a list of dialog boxes that are different sizes or
that do not have common elements, you should place those dialog boxes outside of
a wizard block.

STATUS
======

This is by product design.
