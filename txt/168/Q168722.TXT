TITLE   :GSNW May Create an Unnecessary DependOnService to LanManSer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbnetwork kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have installed Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) on a computer running
Windows NT Server 3.51 Service Pack 5 and Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0. NWLink
is not an installed network protocol and there are no NetWare servers installed
on the LAN.

If GSNW is installed on the server under these conditions, you may notice that
incoming mail may stop being delivered and the Windows NT server may begins to
experience repeated, but dramatic slowdowns in performance.

CAUSE
=====

GSNW sets up dependency with the Server Service (LanManServer). This dependency
is documented in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

   Q123763 Share Names Displayed as DELETED in GSNW

Any attempt to remove GSNW while the dependency exists will result in a warning
message indicating that some services will no longer be available after removal.
The services indicated are as follows:

   Computer Browser
   Directory Replicator
   Net Logon
   Server
   Microsoft Exchange Directory
   Microsoft Exchange Information Store
   Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector
   Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent
   Microsoft Exchange System Attendant

A search of the registry indicates that each of the Microsoft Exchange services
depend on the System Agent, that in turn depends on the Server service. The
other services noted in the warning message (that is, Computer Browser,
Directory Replicator, and Net Logon) all depend upon the Server Service.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

Perform the following steps to remove GSNW:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following registry key:

      H_KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer

2. Remove the NWCworkstation entry from DependOnService.

3. Shutdown and restart your computer.

4. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click Network.

5. Click the Services tab, click Gateway Services for NetWare, click Remove, and
   then click OK.
