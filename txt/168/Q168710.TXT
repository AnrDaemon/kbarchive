======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In some situations it may be necessary to restore an older Microsoft Exchange
Information Store (IS) created under Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 to a
version 5.0 Server. One solution would be a complete uninstallation and re-
installation of the 4.0 Server and an upgrade of the 4.0 Server to 5.0. Since
this would be quite time consuming another method can be used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Either of the following methods can be used after a clean install of Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0.

NOTE: The 5.0 Server must be installed with the same Microsoft Site and
Organization name as the 4.0 Server that the files originated at.

 - Restore the online copy of the IS from the 4.0 backup set, choosing to erase
   all existing data.

 - Remove all data from the current mdbdata directory including all logs, edb
   files, and the Edb.chk file. Copy the 4.0 Priv.edb and Pub.edb files from an
   offline backup. Start the IS.

In either case, the Private and Public IS will be upgraded to version 2.35 and
will start succesfully.
