TITLE   :Unused Dependent LU6.2 Session Not Deactivated
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After SNA Server initiates a dependent LU6.2 session for use by an SNA Server
APPC or CPIC application, the dependent LU6.2 session remains active even after
the LU6.2 conversation is de-allocated. This problem started occurring with SNA
Server 3.0; this problem did not occur with SNA Server 2.x.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server dependent APPC mode entry is configured with "Contention Winner
Limit = 1;" SNA Server 3.0 is failing to override the contention winner status
of a session when responding to a host BIND request. Because SNA Server is not
negotiating to be the contention winner on the LU6.2 session, SNA Server does
not initiate session shutdown after the LU6.2 conversation is de-allocated.

This problem was introduced in SNA Server 3.0 as a side effect of implementing
support for dynamic partnership for APPC LUs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Configure the host subsystem to be the contention loser.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
SP1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
