======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When setting the ComboBox control Text property in the Click event of ComboBox
control, the text always returns blank. This is different behavior than Visual
Basic 3.0 and Visual Basic 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Instead of setting the Text property of the ComboBox control in the Click event,
change it at the LostFocus event by shifting the focus to another control, such
as TextBox, although it leaves the focus set to the TextBox. To work around
that, hide a TextBox behind the ComboBox with TabStop property set to False. In
the GotFocus event of the TextBox, set the focus back to the ComboBox. To place
a TextBox behind the ComboBox in design time, choose the Send To Back menu
command from the Format/Order menu. In run time, set the z-order of TextBox to
1.

The following code example shows how to keep the text of ComboBox control after
being set at the Click event:

1. Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a TextBox control, Text1, to Form1.

3. Add a ComboBox control, Combo1, to Form1.

4. Place the following code into the General Declarations section of Form1:

         Dim ClickFlag As Integer

         Private Sub Combo1_Click()
            ClickFlag = True
            Text1.SetFocus
         End Sub

         Private Sub Combo1_LostFocus()
            If ClickFlag = True Then
               Combo1.Text = Mid(Combo1.Text, 4)
               ClickFlag = False
            End If
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            ClickFlag = False
            With Combo1
                .AddItem "1. Adam"
                .AddItem "2. Bob"
                .AddItem "3. Charles"
            End With
            Combo1.Text = Mid(Combo1.List(0), 4)

            'Hide Text1 under Combo1
            Text1.Move Combo1.Left, Combo1.Top, Combo1.Width, Combo1.Height
            Text1.ZOrder (1)
            Text1.TabStop = False
         End Sub

         Private Sub Text1_GotFocus()
            Combo1.SetFocus
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Load()
           With Combo1
             .AddItem "1. Adam"
