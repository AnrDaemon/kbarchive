SUMMARY
=======

If you use IBM Client Access for Windows 95 or Windows NT, and you specify a
central or roaming profile in User Manager for Domains in Windows NT Server 4.0,
you may experience a problem with central profiles not being saved on the
server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The directory will be created, but the central profile will not be copied to the
central location. The only current workaround is for you to disable the IBM
Client Access for Windows 95 and Windows NT, or not use central or roaming
profiles in conjunction with IBM Client Access for Window 95 and Windows NT.
