PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbLangCPP kbVC kbVC500bug kbVC600bug kbNoUpdate

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Standard C++ Library, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the /Za switch (Disable Language Extensions) when compiling the
Standard C++ Library headers, it causes multiple compiler errors. For example:

   cl /Za /c /GX /Tp"iosfwd"

Causes the following compiler errors:

   iosfwd(132) : error C2906: C++ language change: to explicitly specialize
   class template 'char_traits' use the following syntax - template<>
   struct char_traits<unsigned short> ...

   iosfwd(171) : error C2906: C++ language change: to explicitly specialize class
   template 'char_traits' use the following syntax - template<> struct
   char_traits<char> ...

Examples of other header files known to cause multiple compiler errors like
C2838, C2146, and C2501 are: <utility>, <iterator>, <xstring>,
<functional>, and <limits>.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use the compiler option /Za (Disable Language Extensions) when compiling
the Standard C++ Library headers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.
