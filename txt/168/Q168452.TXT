TITLE   :XGEN: MIME Type Tab Not in IMC Property Page
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocerr

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MIME Type tab in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program allows
an administrator to create, edit, or remove a MIME type. In Microsoft Exchange
Server 4.0, the MIME Type tab is a part of the Internet Mail Connector property
pages; in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0, the MIME Type tab is a part of
Protocols property pages.

However, the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Online documentation (Books Online)
still points to the Internet Mail Connector properties for the MIME Type tab.
This is incorrect.


STATUS
======

We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
