======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Although you create a log file using the Windows NT Performance Monitor utility,
the maximum size that the log file can grow to is 2,147,483,648 bytes. When the
size of a Performance Monitor log reaches this 2.1 gigabyte (GB) limitation, the
file size counter begins to count down backwards placing a negative sign in
front of the number of bytes. Also, the log file is corrupted after it reaches
that point.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT Performance Monitor utility is not designed to collect more than
2.1 GB of data in a log file.

RESOLUTION
==========

For a more concise log file containing only certain counters that you specify,
use a utility in the "Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit" called Performance Data
Logger.

In Windows 2000, the Performance Monitor has a 1 GB limitation and stops adding
information to the log file when it reaches the limit.
