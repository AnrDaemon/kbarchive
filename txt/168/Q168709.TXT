TITLE   :ConfirmHardware In an Unattend.txt File Appears Not to Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During an unattended installation of Windows NT 4.0 with the ConfirmHardware
option set at Yes, Windows NT 4.0 may not prompt you to confirm the hardware
settings.

For example:

[Unattended]
ConfirmHardware = yes
NtUpgrade = no
Win31Upgrade = no
TargetPath = "\winnt"
OverwriteOemFilesOnUpgrade = no
OemPreinstall = yes
FileSystem = LeaveAlone
ExtendOEMPartition = 0
NoWaitAfterTextmode = 1
NoWaitAfterGuiMode = 1
.
.
.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem will occur if the OemPreinstall = Yes. In order to use the
ConfirmHardware option, the OemPreinstall entry must be set to no.

NOTE: If you do set the OemPreinstall option at no, keep in mind that setup will
no longer use the $OEM$ directory or Cmdlines.txt file.

[Unattended]
ConfirmHardware = yes
NtUpgrade = no
Win31Upgrade = no
TargetPath = "\winnt"
OverwriteOemFilesOnUpgrade = no
OemPreinstall = no
FileSystem = LeaveAlone
ExtendOEMPartition = 0
NoWaitAfterTextmode = 1
NoWaitAfterGuiMode = 1
.
.
.
