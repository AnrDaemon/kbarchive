SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 clients using Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) to connect to an endpoint
over named pipes may receive the following error message:

   The RPC server is unavailable. Do you wish to continue?

CAUSE
=====

The named pipe connection code in the Windows 95 RPC run-time libraries does not
make any retry attempts after a failed named pipe connect.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95 and OSR2,
and later versions of this file:

   RPCLTC1.DLL  version 4.00.951  dated 2/13/97  8,192 bytes

A version of this file that resolves this problem is included in DCOM95 for
Windows 95, version 1.3, and can be downloaded from the following Microsoft Web
site:

STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The updated RPC stub code has been modified to retry failed named pipe connects
up to 20 times. This is identical to the method used in Microsoft Windows NT.
