TITLE   :PPTP Protocol Not Available on MCA Computers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install point to point tunneling protocol (PPTP), it does not
appear as an installable protocol in the Network Control Panel on Microchannel
computers.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT operating system components can be installed based on bus type. In
this case, MCA is not listed as a supported bus architecture in the
[PlatformsSupported] section of Oemnxppp.inf.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem open the Oemnxppp.inf file (located in the
%Systemroot%\System32 directory). In the [PlatformsSupported] section, add MCA.
Another resolution is to delete the [PlatformsSupported] section entirely.

See Example:

Before:

   [PlatformsSupported]
   ISA
   EISA
   "JAZZ-INTERNAL BUS"

After:

   [PlatformsSupported]
   MCA
   ISA
   EISA
   "JAZZ-INTERNAL BUS"

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server version 4.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
