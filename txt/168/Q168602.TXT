TITLE   :NetWatch May Not Show User Logged On After Applying SP2
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Service Pack 2 for Windows NT 4.0, the User Logged On may show
up as blank when viewing the properties of a user connected to a share in
NetWatch. NetWatch.exe ships with the Windows NT version 4.0 Resource Kit.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT version 4.0 creates a NULL session as one of the first steps
completed in creating a session with a remote computer running Windows NT
Workstation or Server. This NULL user will be returned as the user name in
NetWatch. There may be times that the username appears, but this may only happen
after the session has been established over a period of time.


RESOLUTION
==========

NetWatch now shows the User Logged On and the file that fixes this behavior is
included in the latest Windows NT version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows
NT Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
