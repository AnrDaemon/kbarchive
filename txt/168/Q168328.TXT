PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER::7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbinterop kbole kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft PowerPoint, when you insert or click a Microsoft Excel object, you
may receive an error message similar to the following:

   The source application is busy and can't respond immediately. You can switch
   to the other application and try to resolve the problem.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if the Microsoft Excel AutoSave add-in is loaded.
PowerPoint cannot create the object because Excel takes too much time to load
when the AutoSave add-in is selected.

NOTE: It is possible that other add-ins may also cause this problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Remove the AutoSave Add-In
------------------------------------

To remove the add-in, follow these steps:

1. Start Microsoft Excel.

2. On the Tools menu, click Add-Ins.

3. Click to clear the AutoSave check box, and then click OK.

If you still receive the error message after trying method 1, try method 2.

Method 2: Start Microsoft Excel First
-------------------------------------

Start Excel first (before you start PowerPoint). Regardless of whether the
AutoSave add-in is loaded, you can insert or edit Microsoft Excel objects in
PowerPoint.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Excel for Windows 95,
version 7.0.
