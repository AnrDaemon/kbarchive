TITLE   :XFOR: How to Exclude OLE Attachments from Migration
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5

KEYWORDS:kbusage exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to migrate a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Lotus cc:Mail,
Novell GroupWise, or Collabra Share postoffice without migrating any of the OLE
objects. This speeds up the migration because all attachment files will be
ignored (left behind).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To accomplish this:

1. From a command prompt, run the Mail Migration utility. This utility is
   located in Exchsrvr\bin and is called Mailmig.exe. To get a list of
   documented options, you can type the following:

   Mailmig /?.

2. For this migration, use the undocumented command /g:o (the letter O, not a
   zero). For example:

   Mailmig /g:o

   This is the command to ignore OLE objects. When this is run, the migration
   wizard will ask for the type of platform to migrate. From this point, simply
   use the wizard interface.
