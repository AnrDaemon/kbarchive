MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and find the following entries:

      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\ 
         Network\Persistent Connections\ 

2. Observe the computer and share names that are preceded by a letter of the
   alphabet. This is the actual list of shares that appear in the drop down box.
   The value named order indicates the sorting order of the list.

   Name of the value: a Path: \\<Computer1>\<Share1>
   Name of the value: b Path: \\<Computer2\<Share2>
   Name of the value: c Path: \\<Computer3>\<Share3>
   Order = cba
   SaveConnections = Yes

   The a, b, and c entries are the actual paths listed by the drop down arrow.
   The Order entry specifies the order in which the a, b, and c etc. entries are
   listed. To clear the list, delete the a, b, and c etc. and the Order entries,
   or delete the entire Persistent Connections key. The list could be modified
   at this point as well, by modifying the Order or a, b, and c etc. values.
