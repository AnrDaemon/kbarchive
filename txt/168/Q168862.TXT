SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to configure the ISO and TP4 Parser for Network
Monitor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Copy the Iso.dll, Iso.ini, Tp4.dll files to your NetMon\Parsers subdirectory.
   These files are located in the BackOffice Resource Kit.

2. Make following additions to your Parser.ini file. The Parser.ini file is
   located in the NetMon directory.

In the [PARSERS] section of the Parser.ini add:

   TP4.DLL = 0: TP4
   ISO.DLL = 0: ISO, TPDU, SPDU, PPDU, ACSE, RTSE, RTS

Then add these following new sections to the Parser.ini file:

[RTS]
    Comment     = "1984 Reliable Transport Service"
    FollowSet   =
    HelpFile    =

[RTSE]
    Comment     = "Reliable Transport Service Element"
    FollowSet   =
    HelpFile    =

[ACSE]
    Comment     = "Association Control Service Element"
    FollowSet   =
    HelpFile    =

[PPDU]
    Comment     = "Presentation Packet Data Unit"
    FollowSet   =
    HelpFile    =

[SPDU]
    Comment     = "Session Packet Data Unit"
    FollowSet   =
    HelpFile    =

[TPDU]
    Comment     = "Transport Packet Data Unit"
    FollowSet   =
    HelpFile    =

[ISO]
    Comment     = "ISO RFC 1006 Protocol"
    FollowSet   =
    HelpFile    =

[TP4]
    Comment     = "TP4 OSI CLNP Protocol"
    FollowSet   = TPDU
    HelpFile    =

Modify the "FollowSet=" entry in the [LLC] section to equal TP4. The [LLC]
section will then read:

[LLC]
    Comment     = "Logical Link Control/802.2 protocol"
    FollowSet   = TP4
    HelpFile    =

After adding these parsers, it would completely parse the X.400
connection/disconnection and data transfer packets. The ISO parser would parse
the following information. 1988 RFC1006 wrapper for X.400 over TCP/IP

   ACSE
   TPDU
   SPDU
   PPDU
   RTSE

1984 RFC1006 wrapper for X.400 overTCP/IP

   TPDU
   SPDU
   RTS   (plus X.410)

The ISO and TP4 Network Monitor Parsers are part of the BackOffice Resource Kit
version 3.0.
