SUMMARY
=======

When you enter text in a document, Word automatically formats the text with the
Body Text style when the following conditions are true:

 - The paragraph ends with a period, question mark, exclamation point, or
   colon.

   -and-

 - The paragraph either spans more than one line or shares all major types of
   formatting with a previously defined body text paragraph.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Word, styles, such as the Body Text style, define the appearance of
various text elements of your document, such as headings, captions, and body
text. When you apply a style to a paragraph or word, you can apply a whole group
of character or paragraph formats or both in one simple operation. When you want
to change the formatting of all the text of a particular element at once, you
just change the style that is applied to that element. Styles make formatting
your document easier. Additionally, they serve as building blocks for outlines
and tables of contents

Microsoft Word 97 has a new feature that automatically creates styles, such as
the Body Text style, as you type,. To find out more information about how this
new feature works, click the Office Assistant, type "How do you automatically
create a style," click Search, and then click the "Turn off Automatic style
definitions" topic.

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Word Help is not installed on your computer, please see the
