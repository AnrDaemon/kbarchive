KEYWORDS:kbusage winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a document that contains a WordArt object, you may receive the
following error message:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

When you click Details, the following error message is shown:

   WINWORD caused an invalid page fault in module WINWORD.EXE at 0137:30093d71.

CAUSE
=====

A symbol font that is represented by a square is either a character that does
not exist in the font or is not correctly converted from one font to a character
in the current font.

In Microsoft Word 97, when you try to use an unrecognized character in WordArt,
WordArt will display the unrecognized character as a question mark. WordArt does
not understand what the character should be. When you try to save the file as
Rich Text Format (RTF), Word is not able to correctly convert the WordArt object
containing an unrecognized character. This situation will result in an invalid
page fault.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR- 1).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 SR-1.
