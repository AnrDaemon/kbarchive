SUMMARY

This article explains how to move a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
database from a Windows NT 3.51 server computer to a new Windows NT 4.0 server
computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

From the Windows NT 3.51 source server:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Services icon. On the Services tab, select
   the Microsoft DHCP Server, and then click Stop. This stops the DHCP Server
   service.

2. Select the Microsoft DHCP Server, and then click Startup. Change the value to
   Disabled, and then click OK. This prevents the DHCP Server service from
   running after you restart the computer.

3. Copy the DHCP directory tree (%SystemRoot%\System32\Dhcp) to a temporary
   location on the new (destination) Windows NT 4.0 DHCP server computer. For
   example, copy the directory tree to C:\Temp\System32\Dhcp.

   NOTE: The following two steps are optional on the source server. You may want
   to wait until the new Windows NT 4.0 DHCP server is functional before
   completing these steps.

4. Remove the DHCP directory (%SystemRoot%\System32\Dhcp).

5. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon, and then click the Services
   tab. Remove the DHCP Server service.

On the new Windows NT 4.0 DHCP server computer:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon. Click the Services tab, and
   add the Microsoft DHCP server. Click OK, and then restart the computer when
   prompted.

2. Once you have restarted, open Control Panel, and then double-click on the
   Services icon. Stop the DHCP Server service.

3. Rename the %SystemRoot%\System32\Dhcp directory to
   %SystemRoot%\System32\Dhcporiginal. (once the below steps are completed, and
   the DHCP server is running, this directory may be deleted)

4. Create a new DHCP directory on the Windows NT 4.0 DHCP server computer, and
   then copy the DHCP directory tree from the temporary directory to
   %SystemRoot%\System32\Dhcp (to replace the DHCP directory that was renamed in
   the previous step).

5. Delete the System.mdb file.

6. Start Windows NT Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

7. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

      SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DHCPServer

8. Click Configuration.

9. From the Registry menu, click Restore.

10. Select %SystemRoot%\System32\Dhcp\Backup\Dhcpcfg.

11. When the warning appears, click Yes.

12. Exit Registry Editor.

13. Start the DHCP service.

14. Start the DHCP Manager.

NOTE: After you restart the DHCP server computer you will receive a message that
the database needs to be updated. You will then be asked if you want to update.
Once the update is complete you will not be able to use this database file on
the Windows NT 3.51 computer again.
