======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Visual Studio 97 object model user applies a switch to a project and that
switch is valid "per-file only" (such as the /h switch on MIDL), then Developer
Studio does not return an error and the switch is not saved when the project is
saved.

RESOLUTION
==========

 

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is no facility in the Developer Studio 97 automation object model to add
settings on a per-file basis. Some settings can only be applied at the file
level. Therefore, some settings cannot be set through Developer Studio
automation.

Visual Studio 6.0 supplies new Automation methods that provide this
functionality.
