   Description: Conversion from Lotus cc:Mail message format to Microsoft
   Exchange format failed due to an exception. Message file name is
   EXPORT\msgXX.ccm. If the problem persists, please move the file from
   EXPORT directory and contact Microsoft Product Support Services.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

1. Create a temporary directory outside of the Exchsrvr directory and move all
   the files out of the Exchsrvr\ccmcdata\export subdirectory.

2. Start the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail service from Control
   Panel Services. The service will start without the Dr. Watson error.

3. Stop the service and copy back some of the files that you moved to the
   temporary subdirectory back to the export directory.

4. Start the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail service. If there is
   a Dr. Watson error again, move those files back to the temporary directory.

5. Move other files from the temporary subdirectory back to export directory and
   restart the service. Continue with this process until you can isolate the
   file that is causing the Dr. Watson.
