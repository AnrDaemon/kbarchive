TITLE   :WD97: Word Appears to Hang Sending Mail on NT 3.51 with MS Mail
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97; winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbusage word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to send e-mail from Microsoft Word 97 using Microsoft Mail on
Windows NT 3.51 by clicking the File menu in Word 97, pointing to Send To, and
clicking Mail Recipient, Word 97 will appear to stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This is a focus problem. The e-mail note is behind the current Word document
window. You cannot use Word at this time, because the e-mail note is waiting for
you to type something into the note.

This problem only occurs when using Microsoft Word 97, Microsoft Mail, and
Windows NT 3.51.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1:

To switch to the e-mail note, press ALT+TAB. When you are finished, Send the
e-mail message. Word will respond normally.

Method 2:

Switch to Microsoft Mail and compose a new message from there, rather than using
the Send To Mail Recipient command from within Microsoft Word 97.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
