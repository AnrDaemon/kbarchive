The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Systems Management Server Installer to deploy certain
applications, it may be necessary to register services, applications, or OCX
controls in the Windows NT or Windows 95 operating system. You can do this with
actions in the Script Editor. This article provides some examples of how to do
this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Registering OLE Server Applications
-----------------------------------

In the Execute Program action item in the Script Editor, enter in the following
fields:

      EXE PATH: %MAINDIR%\yourappname.exe
      COMMAND LINE: /REGSERVER

Registering a Third-Party OCX
-----------------------------

The easiest way to do this is to use the Self Register OCXs/DLLs action item in
the Script Editor to have Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer register
these files automatically. Another option is to manually include Regsvrocx.exe
with your installation, and use the Execute Program action item in the Script
Editor. Use the following example as a model for your own installation:

      EXE PATH: %TEMP%\regsvrocx.exe
      COMMAND LINE: %SYS%\example.ocx

Registering a Third-Party Application
-------------------------------------

In the Execute Program action item in the Script Editor, use the following lines
as a model for your own installation:

      EXE PATH: %MAINDIR%\MYAPP.EXE
      COMMAND LINE: /REGSERVER

Registring a third-Party Service
--------------------------------

You can register services with the Create Service action item in the Script
Editor.
