   Microsoft Exchange dir: ID NO: DS_E_NO_SUCH_ATTRIBUTE_OR_VALUE

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin
/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

To resolve this problem:

1. Verify that there is no requestor object under this dirsync server object.

2. Verify that the Exchange Directory Synchronization service is not running by
   inspecting Control Panel Services.

3. Start Registry Editor. Go to the following key

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services

   and confirm that the MSExchangeDX service does not exist.

4. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by typing the
   following at a command prompt:

   admin /r

5. Select the Dirsync Server to highlight it. On the Edit menu, click Delete Raw
   Object

6. Click OK in response to the following warning message:

   A raw delete should not be performed without prior consultation with
   Microsoft Product Support Services. Do not proceed unless you
   completely understand the potential adverse effects that incorrect
   usage of this feature could have on an entire site.
