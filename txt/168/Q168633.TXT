SUMMARY
=======

Any user who wants to access information on a computer running Microsoft
Exchange Server requires a Client Access License (CAL) for Exchange. However,
not all users of Microsoft Exchange clients require a Windows NT Server Client
Access License (CAL).

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to determine if you need a Windows NT Server CAL.

If your client uses Windows NT Server for any of these basic networking features,
a Windows NT Server CAL is required:

   File Sharing
   Printer Sharing
   Remote Access Services
   Mac Services

If your Exchange Client user is not using any of the above networking features of
Windows NT Server, a Windows NT Server CAL is not required. If you use Windows
NT Server strictly as an application server (that is, just to run Exchange) does
not require a Windows NT Server CAL.

For additional information on Windows NT Server Client Access Licenses, please
