IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error may occur when you try to start the Microsoft Exchange

CAUSE
=====

This can occur when the RestoreInProgress key is not removed from the registry.
This key is removed when the log files are replayed. If no log files have been
replayed, you need to remove the key yourself.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Remove the RestoreInProgress key from:

      HKEY_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS

2. Restore the information store again.
