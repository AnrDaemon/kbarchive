SYMPTOMS

If there are changes to a header included in a .C file that cause a build to
fail and the workspace is closed and re-opened, then the dependency information
is lost and the build system will report the build is up-to-date.

was deleted during the failed build.

RESOLUTION

 - Select Rebuild All from the Build menu.

STATUS
======

beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
