Disk option on the Services tab of the Network Control Panel tool, it will
result in the following error sequence:

   Initialization of the dynamic link library \%SystemRoot%\System32\Rasiphlp.dll
   failed. The process is terminating abnormally.

   Event ID: 7001
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Type: Error
   Category: none

   The Routing and Remote Access Service depends on the Remote Access Connection
   Manager service that failed to start because of the following error: The
   service has returned a service specific error code.

CAUSE
=====

When you install Routing and Remote Access Service by clicking the Have Disk
option on the Services tab of the Network Control Panel tool, the files will be
installed on the server. However, the original Oemnsvra.inf file will be used
for binding review and configuration rather than the updated Oemnsvra.inf file
included with Routing and Remote Access Service.


RESOLUTION
==========

The supported method for installing Routing and Remote Access is to run
Mprsetup.exe. This method copies the updated Oemnsvra.inf file into the
%SystemRoot%\System32 directory allowing Microsoft Windows NT Server to use the
proper Oemnsvra.inf file for binding review and configuration. The Have Disk
method is unsupported. This behavior is by design.
