The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows 95 SNA Server version 3.0 and 4.0 clients require one of the
following to support the Data Encryption feature introduced with SNA Server
3.0:

 - Client for Microsoft Networks

   -or-

 - DCOM for Windows 95

If one of these components is not installed, and encryption is enabled for the
user trying to access the SNA Server, the connection attempt will fail. The
applets included with SNA Server will return errors similar to the following
when this occurs.

5250 Applet:

   There are no SNA Servers running in your domain.

   [F004][010000F0]

3270 Applet:

   ERROR - Reading SNA Server Configuration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

 - The Data Encryption feature of SNA Server 3.0 requires that SNA Server
   clients are validated using the NTLM logon process. Third-party network
   redirectors such as Novell Netware Client 32 which do not provide the NTLM
   security interface will cause the user logon to fail when encryption is
   used.

   The Microsoft Network Client and DCOM for Windows 95 install the necessary
   NTLM security components to allow the user logon to succeed when encryption
   is used.

   DCOM for Windows 95 is a Windows 95 addon that provides support for
   distributed object computing. For more information on DCOM for Windows 95,
   please refer to the following Microsoft Web Page:

   http://www.microsoft.com/com/dcom/dcom95/dcom1_3.asp

 - SNA Server 2.x client software does not support encryption. If encryption is
   enabled for any users/groups that are running SNA Server 2.x clients, those
   clients will not be able to connect to SNA Server.

 - Encryption can be used over any of the client/server LAN transports supported
   by SNA Server.

 - The Windows 95 user does not need to logon to the Windows NT domain that the
   SNA Server belongs or or to any trusted domain in order to use encryption.

 - If the Client for Microsoft Networks is not installed, the Windows 95 SNA
   Server client needs to be configured so that the "Use Windows NT domain
   password" option is not selected under the Advanced tab in the client
   configuration. If this option is not selected, the Logon Domain has to be
   entered to specify which Windows NT Domain will be used to validate the user
   account. This also applies if the Client for Microsoft Networks is installed
   and a non-Named Pipe transport (in other words, TCP/IP or IPX/SPX) is
   selected for the SNA Server client.
