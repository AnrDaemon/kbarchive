PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:5.0 5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbvfp kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bug kbVS97sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When printing some reports under Windows NT, Visual FoxPro causes a Dr. Watson
error such as the following:

   Exception: Access Violation (0xc0000005)

This may happen when printing a report multiple times in a loop.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following code to ensure that the appropriate fields in the report file
are null-terminated, as FoxPro expects. Run this code to process the reports in
the current directory:

   

      *  Get list of report files in current directory.
      nNumReports = ADIR(aReports, "*.FRX")

      *  Loop through reports
      FOR nCurrentReport = 1 TO nNumReports
        USE (aReports[nCurrentReport,1]) EXCLUSIVE ALIAS FRXFILE

        * Add terminating null to printer information record.
        REPLACE ALL expr WITH expr + CHR(0) ;
           FOR objtype = 1 AND RIGHT(expr,1) != CHR(0)

        PACK
        USE
      NEXT

STATUS
======
