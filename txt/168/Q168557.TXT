-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There is a difference between non-delivery-reports (NDRs) on messages to
Internet users with an incorrect domain name and NDRs on messages to Internet
users with a correct domain name, but incorrect user name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NDR on a message with an incorrect domain name looks like the following:

    Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   Subject:hello there
      Sent: 3/27/97 11:18 AM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

      'TEST@JUNK.TEST.CA' on 3/27/97 11:18 AM
            The recipient name is not recognized
            MSEXCH:IMC:SERVER:SITE:ORG 3902 Host Unknown

This is a common error; it is most likely due to a sender's addressing error. You
receive this message back from the System Administrator when you have sent
e-mail to a domain name (for example, JUNK.TEST.CA) that does not exist on the
Internet. The Internet has "Global" Domain Name Servers that resolve Domain
Names to systems. If this domain name is not found, it cannot be routed any
further.

An NDR from an Exchange 5.5 server on a message with the correct domain name but
the incorrect user name looks like the following:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

      To: 'hello@microsoft.com'
      Subject: test
      Sent: 3/27/97 11:21:30 AM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

      hello@microsoft.com on 3/27/97 11:21:30 AM
            Recipient Not Found
            MSEXCH:IMC:REMOTESERVER:REMOTESITE:REMOTEORG

This error is a "Recipient Not Found" error. The mail got to the other system,
but the username (Hello, in this example) did not exist. This error is again
most likely due to a sender's addressing error. Check the address again, and
resend.
