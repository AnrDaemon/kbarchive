======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running RConsole to connect to a Novell NetWare server using the
SPX connection type, you may be unable to obtain a list of servers or connect to
a server. RConsole may report the following error messages:

   SPXEstablishConnection failed to establish a connection to the desired
   server.

   The server connection was terminated by AllocateConnection.

   A connection could not be established with the selected server.


CAUSE
=====

When you are using locally administered network addresses on an Ethernet
network, the hardware MAC address of the NetWare server's network adapter has
eight or more trailing zeroes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the "NODE=xxxxxxxxxxxx" setting on the NetWare server so that the last
eight numbers are not all zeroes.

For information about how to change the "NODE=xxxxxxxxxxxx" setting on a NetWare
server, see the software documentation or contact the manufacturer.
