TITLE   :Access Violation in Explorer when Viewing *.ht file Properties
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a debugger running and you open the property page for a
hyperterminal session file (*.ht), and then close the property page, you will
receive an access violation in Explorer.exe.

NOTE: *.ht files can be found in %winnt%\Profiles\<username>\Start
Menu\Programs\Accessories\Hyperterminal.

CAUSE
=====

HyperTerminal calls RegOpenKey to duplicate a handle to a registry item. But
RegOpenKey does not duplicate the handle, it just returns the one you gave it
(for example, the Shell's handle). Later, the HyperTerminal .dll closes this
handle, and then the shell attempts to close the handle that was already closed
by HyperTerminal.

RESOLUTION
==========

HyperTerminal now uses RegOpenKeyEx, which does give back a new handle to the
same item (in other words, duplicates it correctly), instead of RegOpenKey.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
