TITLE   :Cannot Drag and Drop Connection Between SNA Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server Manager does not allow you to use a drag-and-drop operation to move a
connection to another computer running SNA Server. This feature, which was part
of SNA Server 2.x, was not included in SNA Server 3.0 or 3.0 Service Pack 1.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix is available to correct this problem. With the fix, the administrator can
use a mouse to move connections between servers. However, keyboard support does
not exist. A message will appear after the drag-and-drop operation, warning you
of the need to manually set up a new link service for this connection. The
connection must be dragged to a server and not a connection folder under a
server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 Service
Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
