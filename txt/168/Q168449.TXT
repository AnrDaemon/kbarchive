TITLE   :PRB: Use of Data-Bound Controls Is Version Dependent

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 4.2b 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 4.2b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Loading Visual C++ 5.0 on a system that has Visual C++ 4.x installed will cause
numerous DLLs, OCXs, and other components to be overwritten. One set of
components that is updated are the data-bound controls.

 - DBGrid
 - DBListBox
 - DBComboBox
 - Remote Data Control

Although it is possible to load Visual C++ 4.x and 5.0 on the same system in
different directories, Visual C++ 4.x will have trouble displaying the
data-bound controls properties.

Displaying the "All" Tab on Database Controls such as Microsoft Data Combo and
Microsoft Masked Edit Box shows <Property unknown> after having installed
Visual C++ 5.0. Normally, you will see Datasource, field properties, etc.

CAUSE
=====

Visual C++ 5.0 installs upgrades of the data-bound controls that have the same
file names as the versions that ship with Visual C++ 4.x.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to work with Visual C++ 4.2, replace the appropriate controls in
your system32 from the version 4.2 redist\ocx directory (in this case,
MSMASK32.OCX DBLIST32.OCX).

The Property Dialog Headings for these controls have also changed to Microsoft
DBCombo, version 5.0 and Microsoft Masked Edit Box version 5, rather than
Microsoft DBCombo and Microsoft Masked Edit Box. Creating a new project exhibits
the same problem. This makes is somewhat difficult to use these controls.

There are three controls that have the same name as the previous version and
therefore overwrite the version that works with version 4.2:

 - DBGrid32.ocx
 - DBList32.ocx
 - MSMask32.ocx

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is not possible to work with version 5.0 data-bound controls in Visual C++
4.x or with version 4.x data-bound controls in Visual C++ 5.0. The data-bound
controls have been changed in these two versions.

It is highly recommended that you chose between versions 4.2 or 5.0 when working
with database applications that use the data-bound controls.

Although this is problem in the design interface, the newer 5.0 controls can be
used by older 4.2 applications at run time.
