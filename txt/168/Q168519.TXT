SYMPTOMS
========

The Dir/Dir$ function in Microsoft Visual Basic may be used to test for a file's
existence. It returns the name (or names) of the files that fit the search
criteria. However, when using a UNC (Universal Naming Conventions) path to
search for files that exist on a network directory, the Dir$ function may not
return valid information. This behavior is most common when searching network
paths. It can also occur when searching for files that have unusual names (such
as files that have no extension).

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, the OpenFile API call may be used to test for the
existence of a file. Passing the parameter OF_EXIST to the OpenFile function
causes OpenFile to search for an existing file. It does not write to or open the
file when this parameter is passing by itself.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample shows how to use the OpenFile API function to check for the
existence of a file named "Test" that has no file extension and is located at
the following location: \\ServerName\ShareName:

      'If using a 32-bit version of Visual Basic, this declaration is
      'required;

      Declare Function OpenFile Lib "kernel32" (ByVal lpFileName As String, _
                                                lpReOpenBuff As OFSTRUCT, _
                                                ByVal wStyle As Long) As Long

      'If using the 16-bit version of Visual Basic 4.0, this declaration is
      'required;

      Declare Function OpenFile Lib "kernel" (ByVal lpFileName As String, _
                                              lpReOpenBuff As OFSTRUCT, _
                                              ByVal wStyle As Integer) _
                                              As Integer

      'Both 16-bit and 32-bit utilize these constants and structure:

      Public Const OFS_MAXPATHNAME = 128
      Public Const OF_EXIST = &H4000

      Type OFSTRUCT
          cBytes As Byte
          fFixedDisk As Byte
          nErrCode As Integer
          Reserved1 As Integer
          Reserved2 As Integer
          szPathName(OFS_MAXPATHNAME) As Byte
      End Type

      'On the VB IDE menu bar select Tools/Options/Project/Startup Form and
      'set Sub Main() as the project start-up form.

      Sub main()
          Dim result As Integer
          Dim strPath As String
          Dim strucFname As OFSTRUCT
          Dim strResults As String
          Dim strSearchFile As String

          strSearchFile = "\\ServerName\ShareName\Test"

          result = OpenFile(strSearchFile, strucFname, OF_EXIST)

          'The above line causes OpenFile to search for the
          'file Test (no extension) on the server network path.
          'Passing the OF_EXIST parameter tells the OpenFile
          'function to search for the file, the file will not be
          'opened or modified in any way.

          If result <> -1 Then
              MsgBox "File found"
          Else
              MsgBox "File not found"
          End If
      End Sub

If the file in question is found, data pertaining to that file is placed into the
variable strucFname.
