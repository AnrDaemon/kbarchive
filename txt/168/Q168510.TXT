PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbConfig kbScheduler smsconfig smsscheduler

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Package compression fails with event ID 330 error, even though it appears that
the Systems Management Server service account has all the appropriate rights to
the source directory.

   Non-fatal Error in module: SMS_SCHEDULER

   Operation: Compress
   Object: Package
   Object name: A0100100
   Error code: 1002

   An error occurred while trying to compress the contents of the source
   directory specified for the server version of the package.

The following is the corresponding excerpt from the Sched.log file:

      Creating package file
      '\\SERVER\SMS_SHRI\site.srv\sender.box\tosend\A0100100.S00'.~
      $$<SMS_SCHEDULER><Mon Apr 21 09:02:14 1997~><thread=168>
      ~Package source \\SERVER\SHARE\APP doesn't exist or we failed
      to access it, Win32 Error = 5   $$<SMS_SCHEDULER><Mon Apr 21 09:02:14
      1997~><thread=168>
      ~Cannot compress the package file, return code = 4865
      $$<SMS_SCHEDULER><Mon Apr 21 09:02:14 1997~><thread=168>
      Creation of compressed package file failed!~   $$<SMS_SCHEDULER><Mon Apr
      21 09:02:14 1997~><thread=168>

CAUSE
=====

It is possible that the password for the Scheduler service's entry for the
Systems Management Server service account is not the same as the current
password in the Windows NT Server Security Account Manager (SAM) database. This
may happen if the Systems Management Server service account is improperly
changed by clicking Account on the Site Properties menu, as this functionality
does not check the account against the SAM database.

Changing the service account through the Site Operations: Service Account option
in Systems Management Server Setup does provide the functionality of checking
the account and password.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set the Systems Management Server service account
name and password through the Site Operations: Service Account option of Systems
Management Server Setup. This option shuts down the services to change the
service account.
