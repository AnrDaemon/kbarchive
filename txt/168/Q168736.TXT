 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When administrators use the Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard and specify the
location of the MS Mail postoffice, they may receive the following error
message:

   Invalid Postoffice

Administrators can log on to the target postoffice and users can send and
retrieve messages without problems.

CAUSE
=====

File corruption within the MS Mail postoffice core files (Access.glb,
Access2.glb, and Access3.glb) are out of synch.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restore valid Access.glb, Access2.glb, and Access3.glb files from backup. To
determine if the files are corrupt, use the following formula:

Divide the size of the file by the number specified next to the chart. All files
should produce the same resulting number.

        File                   Divide By
        ====                   =========

      Access2.glb                  69
      Access3.glb                 512
