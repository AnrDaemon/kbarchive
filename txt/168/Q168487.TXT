SYMPTOMS
========

Thirty minutes to an hour after your Windows NT server computer is started,
clients start to have connectivity problems with the server. When accessing
resources they may receive the error:

   The remote computer is not available.

-OR-

Clicking on the server in Network Neighborhood may give the error:

   remote computer is not accessible.

Restarting the server temporarily resolves the problem, but it occurs again.

You can still ping the server by name and/or TCP/IP address.

After disabling the Quota Advisor services in Control Panel/Services, the errors
still occur.

Control Panel/Devices that also needs to be disabled. Uninstalling the software
with the Uninstall program may not completely remove the software.
