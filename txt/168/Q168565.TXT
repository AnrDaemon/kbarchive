TITLE   :SMS: Child Site Attachment May Result in Incorrect Inventory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDatabase kbDataLoader smsdatabase smsdataloader

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a child site attaches to a parent site, inventory on the parent site may
appear to be inaccurate. Inventory on the child site appears to be correct, but
the inventory on the parent site does not.

The first child to attach to the parent may appear correct, but the inaccurate
inventory may appear when a second child attaches. Symptoms will manifest in
data that is stored as COMMON rather than SPECIFIC according to the DMTF
specifications. Examples of this would be in the PC_BIOS or Disk data, although
any COMMON storage may be affected. Symptoms may be displayed as a duplicate
drive C or no drive A for certain systems. Other symptoms may exhibit themselves
as well, but depends on the state of the child and parent databases before the
site attachment.

This problem occurs only during initial site attachments. Any data sent from the
child to the parent after the initial site attachment is processed differently,
and is not affected.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server DataLoader fails to properly increment an internal
value that ensures that the COMMON storage values remain unique during a site
attachment. This only occurs if the COMMON storage attribute does not yet exist
on the parent site. If the component already exists on the parent site, child
site data merging will take place properly for that inventory component.


STATUS
------
