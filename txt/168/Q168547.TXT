TITLE   :DSMN Errors in Event Viewer with Netware Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbnetwork kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Directory Service Manager for NetWare (DSMN) is installed and successfully
managing NetWare servers. However, an error message continually shows up in
Event Viewer:

   Event ID 8026: The sync agent service failed to remove account from group
   CONSOLE OPERATORS on the NetWare server <servername> due to error
   10253.

This event will occur for each NetWare server that is being managed by DSMN.

CAUSE
=====

Arcada Backup (now Seagate) installs a Console Operators group on the Windows NT
server computer. There are no members in this group and according to Seagate is
not necessary for Arcada Backup to function properly.

The "Console Operators" group will not be copied to NetWare 3.x servers during
the synchronization process because the group name contains a space, and does
not conform to NetWare's group naming convention (In NetWare, spaces in group
names are changed to underscores). NetWare 4.x servers are not affected by this
limitation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the Console Operators group from the Windows NT server computer and
synchronize the domain.

NOTE: If a group is required "console_operators" group name is acceptable.
