The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.01 
 - Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You are unable to save changes to an item in a public folder, even though you
have owner permissions to the public folder and can perform all other tasks with
the item, including deleting it.

If you are using the Microsoft Outlook 8.01 client, the following error message
will appear:

   Microsoft Outlook
   Your changes could not be saved because you don't have permission to
   modify some or all of the items in this folder. Do you want to save a
   copy of this item to the default folder for the item?

If you are using the Microsoft Exchange Client version 5.0, the following error
message will appear:

   Microsoft Exchange
   Changes to the item could not be saved. You do not have the permission
   to send the message on behalf of the specified user.

CAUSE
=====

The public folder in question is set up so that all messages placed in the
folder are to be forwarded to it. Because the user trying to modify the message
does not have the correct permission to send mail on behalf of the original
sender, the message cannot be saved.

RESOLUTION
==========

To be able to save changes back to the public folder, do one of the following:

 - Edit the Administration Properties of the folder and change the option

   Drag/Drop posting is a: Forward

   to

   Drag/Drop posting is a: Move/Copy

   -OR-

 - Ensure the user making the changes can send mail on behalf of the original
   sender of the public folder item.
