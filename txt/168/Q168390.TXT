   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel, the
Add/Remove Programs tool may open very slowly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the registry entry point to an incorrect location for
the Apps.ini file, or if the Apps.ini file is missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method:

Method 1
--------

Verify that the Apps.ini file is located in the folder pointed to by the
AppInstallPath value in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion

If the value points to a network location, verify your ability to connect to the
network location.

Method 2
--------

If Apps.ini functionality is not required, delete the AppInstallPath value from
the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Apps.ini file contains a list of programs and their installation locations.
When there is an AppInstallPath entry in the registry that points to a valid
Apps.ini file, there is a Network Install tab in the Add/Remove Programs
Properties dialog box. Programs listed in the Apps.ini file are listed on this
tab.

REFERENCES
==========

For information about creating an Apps.ini file, see page 719 in the Microsoft
Windows 95 Resource Kit.
