KEYWORDS:kbpng

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Pack And Go feature in PowerPoint, you may receive the
following error:

   The file <path>\<filename> cannot be removed. Please remove it
   and re-run Pack and Go.

where <path> and <filename> represent the location and the file you
are trying to pack, respectively.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the temporary location used by Pack And Go (the
<path>) contains a file with the same name as one of the temporary files
created by the Pack And Go Wizard. The most common cause of this problem is that
the presentation you are attempting to pack is in that location.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, save the presentation to a different location before
you use the Pack And Go feature.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
