TITLE   :FIX: Odbccp32.lib Requires Msvcrt.lib to Compiler
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG #: 4637 (odbc3)

SYMPTOMS
========

An ODBC application may get the following link errors when linking with
Odbccp32.lib;

   odbccp32.lib(dllload.obj) : error LNK2001:
   unresolved external symbol __imp__rename

   odbccp32.lib(dllload.obj) : error LNK2001:
   unresolved external symbol __imp___stat

CAUSE
=====

Odbccp32.lib is not a pure import library. It contains some object code that has
unsatisfied externals: rename and state. The rename and state functions are
defined in Msvcrt.lib.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make sure an ODBC application links Msvcrt.lib
before Odbccp32.lib.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Open Database
Connectivity version 3.0. This problem has been corrected in U.S. Service Pack 1
for Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0. For more information,
contact your primary support provider.
