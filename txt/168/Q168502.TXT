TITLE   :Windows NT Reboots Continuously During Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Windows NT Server or Workstation, your computer may
reboot continuously after the first reboot.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Bootsect.dat file in the root of the hard disk is
infected with a boot-sector virus. The Bootsect.dat file is an image of the boot
sector with added code to load Setupldr.bin to continue the Windows NT
installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Boot the computer from a virus-free bootable floppy disk. Use a third- party
virus detector (such as McAfee's Virus Scan) to scan the root of the drive.
Clean the virus from the Bootsect.dat file. If the file cannot be cleansed, boot
from a write-protected bootable MS-DOS disk and use the SYS C: command to place
a new boot sector on the boot drive. Run Setup again to create a new
Bootsect.dat file, or reformat the drive and reinstall Windows NT.
