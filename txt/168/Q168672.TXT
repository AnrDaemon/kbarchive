TITLE   :Cannot Read Japanese E-mail Messages on MSN
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.2,1.3,2.0,2.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbenv kbmsn

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may be unable to read Japanese e-mail messages on MSN, The Microsoft
Network.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the messages are incorrectly encoded by the local
mail server or by the mail client. Most Japanese characters use 8-bit data.
Therefore, even text messages have to be encoded through the Internet. The code
should be Shift-Jis in order to view a Japanese message with Windows; however,
messages could be incorrectly encoded into EUC or JIS (ISO-2022-JP).

RESOLUTION
==========

If the mail message uses a lot of "Hankaku Katakana" characters, it is probably
encoded in EUC. If the message uses a lot of "$" characters, it is probably
encoded in Jis. In these cases, messages can be retrieved correctly in Japanese
(Shift-Jis) by using an encoding tool such as PageBrowser.
