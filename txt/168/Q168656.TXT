======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you receive a message from a foreign X.400 messaging system, Microsoft
Exchange Server looks at the P1 envelope of the message to determine the
friendly name that will be displayed on the From line of the message.

Some foreign systems to do not pass along the friendly name field (/FFN) and in
those cases Microsoft Exchange Server displays the literal X.400 O/R address:

   C=us;A=admd;P=prmd;O=orgname;S=surname;G=givenname

It is not easy to determine the originator name in this circumstance.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 1 addresses this problem by reversing the X400
O/R address so that the originators name can be easily identified:

   G=givenname;S=surname;O=orgname;P=prmd;A=admd;C=us

The recipient client only needs to look at the first two fields to identify the
sender.

Additional query words: sender mailbus openmail reverse OR Address syntax sequence
