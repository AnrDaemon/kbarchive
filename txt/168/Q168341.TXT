TITLE   :SMS: Windows 95 PCM Fails to Run UNC Path Command Lines
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbinterop kbnetwork kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The 16-bit version of the Package Command Manager (Pcmwin16.exe) fails to run a
package command line that uses a UNC path. Windows 95 attempts to run Setup.exe
from the package directory on the distribution server instead of using the UNC
path specified on the command line.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, specify a command line without using a UNC path.
