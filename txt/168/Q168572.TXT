KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install active server pages on a computer running Windows NT
Server 3.51, the installation stops with the following Warning message:

   Active Server Pages requires Microsoft Win95 or WinNT 4.0
   Operating System

   Aborting Installation

The .asp files provide the functionality and user interface for the Microsoft
Exchange Active Server Components client through the Internet browser.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Active Server program requires that active server pages (.asp)
files be installed on the Microsoft Windows NT Active Server computer. Active
server pages are included with Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 2
(SP2) and later versions. Active server pages must be installed before the
Active Server Components can be installed on the computer running Exchange
Server.

Active Server Pages are not available for Microsoft Windows NT 3.51. For this
reason, Active Server is not supported on the Microsoft Windows NT 3.51
computer.
