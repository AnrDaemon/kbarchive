TITLE   :BUG: Keywords Cause New Version When "Undo Check Out" Set
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you check in unchanged files through the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, if you
are using Keyword Expansion and have the setting:

   Check in unchanged files set to "Undo Check out"

the file is still modified to reflect a new version and date/time. This did not
happen in Version 4.0a build 1309.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open the SourceSafe Admin tool and set the Expand keywords in files of type
   to *.TXT.

2. Close the Admin utility and create a text file that contains the following
   text:

   $Archive: $ Visual SourceSafe archive file location
   $Author: $ User who last changed the file
   $Date: $ Date and time of last check in
   $Header: $ Logfile, Revision, Date, Author
   $History: $ File history, Visual SourceSafe format
   $Log: $ File history, RCS format
   $Logfile: $ Same as Archive
   $Modtime: $ Date and time of last modification
   $Revision: $ Visual SourceSafe version number
   $Workfile: $ Filename
   $NoKeywords: $ No keyword expansion for all keywords that follow.

3. Add the text file to SourceSafe. In the SourceSafe Explorer, open the Options
   dialog box from the Tools menu and set the "Check in Unchanged Files" to
   "Undo Check out."

4. Check out the text file and check it back in again.

5. Show History of the file. Note that the file is modified and a new version is
   created even though the option is set to "Undo" the checkout.
