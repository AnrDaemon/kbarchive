PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2 SP1, 1.2 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When remote controlling a Windows NT client computer running Systems Management
Server 1.2 Service Pack 1 or 2, you may receive a STOP 1E Blue Screen error, or
the system on the client may stop responding when you attempt to run the
"gold-key" from the Quick Windows Viewer.

CAUSE
=====

This problem appears to be very hardware-dependent, and only occurs if a Windows
NT client computer is not restarted after the Remote Control Agent is installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

The problem does not occur after the Windows NT client computer is restarted.
The Client Configuration Manager in Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 2
now requests a restart after the Remote Control Agent is installed. To gain full
functionality, client computers running Windows NT should be restarted after the
Remote Control Agent is installed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.2 Service Pack 1 and 2. This problem was corrected in the latest
Microsoft Systems Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the hotfix installed, the "gold-key" is not functional on Windows NT
clients that have not been restarted since the Remote Control Agent was
installed.
