SYMPTOMS
========

The "Execute" method of Microsoft Internet Transfer Control will fail on a
case-sensitive server with directories or files containing lowercase letters.

RESOLUTION

To work around this behavior:

 - the WinInet API can be used for various FTP functions.

   -or-

 - for directory listings, the OpenURL method of the control can be used as
   follows:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
             Text1.Text = Inet1.OpenURL("ftp://ftp.host.com/pub")
         End Sub

STATUS

MORE INFORMATION
================

UNIX servers support both uppercase and lowercase characters in file names and
directory names; file systems, such as FAT and NTFS, treat both cases the same.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Place a CommandButton on a Visual Basic form.

2. Place this code in the button:

         Private Sub_Command1_Click()
             ' ftp.host.com is a server that supports lowercase
             ' file names, such as a UNIX server, and has a directory
             ' called "pub" in lower case.
             Inet1.Execute "FTP://ftp.host.com", "CD pub"
         End Sub

3. Place the following code in the StateChanged event for the Inet control:

         Private Sub Inet1_StateChanged(ByVal State As Integer)
             Debug.Print Inet1.ResponseInfo
         End Sub

4. Run the form. In the debug window, you will see this message:

   550 PUB: No such file or directory.
