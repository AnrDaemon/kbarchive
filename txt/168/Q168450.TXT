a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange 5.0 client allows the default location of the
AutoSignature (Autotext.sig) file to be specified with the addition of a
registry key entry.

NOTE: In the Microsoft Exchange 4.0 client the default location of the
Autotext.sig file is not configurable. By default, the Autotext.sig file is
placed in the Windows subdirectory.
