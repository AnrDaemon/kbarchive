TITLE   :SNA Manager Fails to Display Status for Dependent APPC LUs
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server Manager fails to display the User Name and Client for an APPC or CPIC
application that is using a dependent LU6.2 session. Instead, the status
information displays as:

   User Name: <Not In Use>
   Client: <n/a>

CAUSE
=====

The problem with the dependent LU occurs because the session is created before
there is an internal user record. Normally, internal user records are created
first. When Manage is notified of an APPC session, it matches the data with an
existing user record. In this case it fails to find a match.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 Service
Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, Manage periodically refreshes the APPC session data so
that after the user record is created, Manage gets the new APPC session info,
and is able to match it with the user record.
