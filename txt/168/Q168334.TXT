KEYWORDS:kbusage

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a document in a format other than "Word Document (*.doc)," and the
Read-only Recommended option is selected, Word does not save the Read-only
Recommended option with the document.

NOTE: You do not receive a warning alerting you that the option will be lost.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Word 97, when you save a document with a password in a different format, such
as "Rich Text Format (*.rtf)," the following message is displayed:

   This document is password protected. Saving this document in a format other
   than the current version of Word will result in the loss of this protection.

When you save a document in a format other than "Word Document (*.doc)" with the
Read-only Recommended option selected, Word does not display a similar message,
and the Read-only Recommended option is not saved.


When you use the Read-only Recommended option with Word documents, you are
prompted to open the document as read-only the next time you open it. If you
open it as read-only and make changes, you are prompted to save the document
under a new file name.

To set the Read-only Recommended option:

1. On the File menu, click Save (if the file has not previously been saved).

   -or-

   On the File menu, click Save As.

2. Click Options.

3. On the Save tab, select the Read-only Recommended check box, and then click
   OK.
