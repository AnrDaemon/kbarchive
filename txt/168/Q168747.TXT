The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer running Microsoft Windows 95 (all releases) using the Microsoft
TCP/IP protocol, the following error message may occur when certain data is
received over the network:

   Fatal exception 0E at 0028:<address> in VxD MSTCP(01) + 000041AE.
   This was called from 0028:<address> in VxD NDIS(01) + 00000D7C.

After this error message occurs, the computer may not receive further network
data until Windows is restarted.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if certain, very specific, "out-of-band" data
packets are deliberately sent to the server during a TCP/IP session.

releases):
