WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use custom document properties (on the File menu,
click Properties, and then click the Custom tab) to set custom document
variables and then use the DOCPROPERTY field to use the values in a header,
footer, or text box.

To Create a Custom Document Property
------------------------------------

1. On the File menu, click Properties, and then click the Custom tab.

2. In the Name box, type a name for the custom property, or select a name from
   the list.

3. In the Type box, click the type of property you want.

4. In the Value box, type a value for the property.

   The value you enter must match the selection in the Type box. For example, if
   you click Number in the Type box, you must type a number in the Value box.
   Values that don't match the property type are stored as text.

5. Click Add.

6. Click OK.

To Insert the DOCPROPERTY Field in the Document
-----------------------------------------------

1. Click where you want to insert the DOCPROPERTY field.

2. On the Insert menu, click Field.

3. Click to select Document Information in the Categories list, and then click
   to select DocProperty in the "Field names" list.

4. To add a custom document property to the field, click Options.

5. From the Property list, select the custom property you want.

6. Click "Add to Field".

7. In the Field Options dialog box, click OK.

8. In the Field dialog box, click OK.

NOTE: For more information about a specific field or option, while in the Field
dialog box, select the field name or option, and then press F1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you insert a blank DOCVARIABLE field into a header or footer, that is, when
you insert the field with no reference to a stored document variable, and then
you later add the document variable reference and update the field, you do not
receive the error described in the "Symptoms" section of this article. However,
when you update the DOCVARIABLE field, the field remains blank.

Performing these same steps in a text box causes the error described in the
"Symptoms" section of this article to occur when you update the field.
