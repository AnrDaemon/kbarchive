SUMMARY
=======

The MSChart control does not expose a method that enables you to print the chart
directly. However, you can use the PrintForm method to print the entire form
containing the MSChart control. This article describes a method for printing
only the chart.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can print the chart of an MSChart control by copying the contents of the
control using the EditCopy method, pasting the chart to a PictureBox control,
and then printing the picture via the PaintPicture method of the Printer
object:

1. Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Click Components on the Project menu. Check "Microsoft Chart Control" and
   click OK.

3. Draw an MSChart control and a CommandButton on Form1.

4. Click Add Form on the Project menu, select Form and click Open. This will add
   a form named Form2 to the project.

5. Draw a PictureBox control on Form2.

6. Add the following code to the Click event of Command1 on Form1:

         MSChart1.EditCopy
         Printer.Print " "
         Printer.PaintPicture Clipboard.GetData(), 0, 0
         Printer.EndDoc

7. Run the application. Click the CommandButton to print the chart to your
   default printer.

   NOTE: The EditCopy method copies both the data and the picture of the chart to
   the clipboard. Then, when you use a Paste command to retrieve the contents of
   the clipboard, the receiving application determines whether the picture or
   the data is pasted. In this example, Picture1 requests the clipboard data and
   receives a picture of the chart rather than the chart's data.
