TITLE   :XFOR: IMC Setup for Non-MIME Inbound Japanese SMTP Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs with Non-MIME inbound SMTP mail messages using the Japanese
Industry Standard (JIS) character set. The mail messages may not be readable in
the Japanese Exchange Client if the Exchange Server computer with the Internet
Mail Connector (IMC) is the English version.

WORKAROUND
==========

This workaround assumes that unreadable mail messages are from the domain JP.
However, the following steps can be applied to any domains that send non-MIME
outbound SMTP mail using JIS character set.

1. Click the Internet Mail tab in the IMC.

2. Click the E-Mail Domain to create a new entry.

3. Specify JP as the E-Mail Domain.

4. Set JIS for Non-MIME Character Set Translation.
