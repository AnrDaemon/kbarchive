-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a message is addressed to a personal distribution list, the distribution
list display name is replaced by the actual members of the personal distribution
list once the message arrives in the recipient's mailbox.

When a message is sent to a distribution list that was created in the Microsoft
Exchange Server Administrator program, the alias name remains in the To line.
The individual member names are not displayed when the message arrives, as they
are in message sent to a personal distribution list.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A distribution list (DL) is a collection of recipients logically grouped
together and addressed as a single recipient. A message addressed to a
distribution list will be delivered to every user in the list. Administrators
can create distribution lists and add them to an address book such as the Global
Address Book.

You can also create personal distribution lists and add them to your Personal
Address Book (PAB). A Microsoft Exchange Server distribution list is similar to
a PC Mail group.

When a mailbox is deleted from Exchange Server, the user will also be deleted
from distribution lists created within Exchange Server Administrator program,
but will not be deleted from any personal distribution lists created by
individual users.
