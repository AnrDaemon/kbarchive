-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you click Cancel during a Reinstall of The Puzzle Collection, the Setup
program will not have a chance to update the product files. If Setup does not
have the chance to update the files, it will cause the files located in the
Puzzle Collection folder on the hard disk to become corrupted.

Canceling the Setup program during the copying of files from the compact disc to
the hard disk will corrupt the files on the hard disk and you will no longer be
able to play the games.

RESOLUTION

Restore the files on the hard disk by deleting the remaining files from the
Puzzle Collection folder using Windows Explorer, and then run The Puzzle
Collection Setup again.
