TITLE   :SMS: Remote Control Session Shows Machine Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you activate a remote control session where the Visible Signal option is
enabled on the client (under Help Desk Options), the "Being Accessed By" window
shows the computer name of the system that initiated the remote control
session.

If cryptic machine names are used on a network, it is not always clear who is
remote controlling the Systems Management Server client. If the administrator's
user name was displayed instead, it would eliminate much of the ambiguity.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
