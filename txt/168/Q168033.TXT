PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

After you use Domain Name Service (DNS) Manager to promote a secondary zone to
primary zone, or demote a primary zone to secondary zone, the DNS Server service
will not restart. Trying to restart the service will produce the following Event
ID's:

   Event ID: 7023
   The MS DNS Server service terminated with the following error:
   The data is invalid.

   Event ID: 130
   DNS Server zone <zone name> has invalid or corrupted registry data.
   Delete its registry data and recreate with DNSAdmin.

   Event ID: 133
   DNS Server secondary zone <zone name>, had no master IP addresses in
   registry.  Secondary zones require masters.

CAUSE
=====

The registry key that specifies the zone type does not get updated correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Registry Editor to modify the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\Ccs\Services\Dns\Zones
key in the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To modify the zone to the correct type, perform the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\Ccs\Services\Dns\Zones

3. On the zones key, select the key with the name of secondary zone (like
   mydomain.com) which was promoted to primary. Set the value to 1.

      Value Name: Type
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
      Value:      1
                  0x1 specifies Primary zone
                  0x2 specifies secondary zone

4. Quit Registry Editor and restart the Microsoft DNS Service in the Services
   Control Panel.
