SYMPTOMS
========

Component Download Fails for DCOM Projects when using Setup Wizard to create
download files. If you have included a Remote Object in an ActiveX Document
setup, you could see the following error on code download:

   "Internet Explorer is opening file of unknown type:
   <Name of Document>.VBD from"

CAUSE
=====

The MySamp.cab download will not work if the Msracli.cab is located in a
different folder than RemoteReg.cab.

RESOLUTION
==========

MySamp should be the name of your project. The workaround for the download
problem is below:

1. Run the Setup Wizard from Visual Basic 5.0 and select "Add Remote." The Setup
   Wizard will create the download files for your MySamp project.

2. Make sure Msracli.cab is located in the same folder as RemoteReg.cab.
   RemoteReg.cab is put in the download directory created by Setup Wizard.
   Msracli.cab is shipped on the Visual Basic 5.0 CD-ROM and is located in
   VB5/tools/cabinets/Msracli.cab.

3. Modify the MySamp.inf file created by Setup Wizard:

   Code in MySamp.inf:

         [MSRACli.cab_Installer]
         file-win32-x86=http://activex.microsoft.com/controls/vb5/MSRACli.cab
         InfFile=MSRACli.inf

   Replace with:

         [MSRACli.cab_Installer]
         file-win32-x86=MSRACli.cab
         InfFile=MSRACli.inf

4. Run Makecab.exe on MySamp.inf file. Makecab.exe is provided by Visual Basic
   5.0 in the \vb5\setupkit\kitfil32\makecab.exe.

5. Run the following line of code using the MySamp.ddf created by the Setup
   Wizard:

      makecab.exe /F MySamp.ddf

6. This will create a MySamp.cab in the same directory as MySamp.ddf and
   MySamp.inf. Copy MySamp.cab to the correct directory and your download should
   work correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
