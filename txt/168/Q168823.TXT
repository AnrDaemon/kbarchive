SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic 5.0 Books online describes using the Exchange IISAM driver for Jet
3.5. This documentation implies that this driver ships with Visual Basic 5.0,
but it does not.

This article describes how to obtain this driver from two locations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following Visual Basic 5.0 Books online topics describe using the Exchange
IISAM for Microsoft Jet 3.5:

  Guide to Data Access Objects
    Accessing External Data
      Working with Microsoft Exchange

  Visual Basic Help
    Additional Information
      Other Help Files
        Microsoft Jet SQL Reference
          Microsoft Registry Settings for External Data Sources
            Initializing the Microsoft Exchange Data Source Driver

The documentation does not state that the driver ships with Visual Basic 5.0, but
its inclusion implies that it does.

The driver can be found in the following locations:

 - On the World Wide Web:
   http://www.microsoft.com//accessdev/articles/exe/wzmapi80.exe This is a
   self-extracting, self-installing EXE. It also installs two Microsoft Access
   Wizards for use with that product.

 - On the Office Pro 97 or Microsoft Access 97 CD-ROMs in the \ValuPack\DataAcc
   folder. Run DataAcc.exe to install. This also installs Paradox and Lotus
   IISAM drivers.
