PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is not possible to obtain property information for the UserConnection object
from a Visual Basic Add-In. The one exception is the name property. All other
property values are not available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This situation is the result of the current implementation of the UserConnection
ActiveX Designer. Object models are optional for ActiveX Designers and may or
may not be implemented by the developer. In the absence of the relevant object
model, as is the case with the UserConnection, the only property values
available to an Add-In are those that appear in the properties window. Microsoft
is currently reviewing this issue with regard to the UserConnection and will
post additional information here when it becomes available.


Additional query words: user connection
