SUMMARY
=======

When you use a date field as a filter criteria in a remote view to an Oracle
table, the date value must be specified using the following format:

   'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example filter criteria returns all records from the table where
the date field contains a date later than January 1, 1996:

      Date_Field > '1996-01-01 00:00:00'

NOTE: The time portion of this date must be included. If the time is not needed,
use 00:00:00 as the time portion of the datetime expression as in the above
example.
