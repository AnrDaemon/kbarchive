TITLE   :FP97: FP Explorer Finds Misspellings that FP Editor Doesn't
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to check spelling across Webs from FrontPage Explorer, the
spell checker may find misspellings that were not found by FrontPage Editor.

CAUSE
=====

FrontPage Explorer uses a method of spell checking that spell checks words
separated by punctuation without spaces. FrontPage Editor checks the word on
either side of the punctuation, but not including the punctuation.

For example, FrontPage Explorer will flag the following string as a misspelling:

   "filename.back"

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the spelling, use a copy and paste operation to place the contents of
the Web page in a word processing program, such as Microsoft Word 97, and run
the spell checker from there.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
