TITLE   :Postscript Preprocessor Fails to Find Any Embedded Fonts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprintkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you print to a file from Windows NT using a postscript printer driver and
then attempt to preprocess the data with a postscript preprocessor, the
preprocessor fails to find any embedded fonts.


CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT postscript driver was not correctly delimiting font information
in the postscript output. The effect is that preprocessors do not find the font
resources in the job, and, therefore, can not do any replacement or editing.

This problem has no effect on printing. It only affects preprocessors that try to
edit the postscript output to replace resources.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows
NT Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
