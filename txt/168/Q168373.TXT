PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0

KEYWORDS:kbcode kberrmsg kbtool kbVC500bug kbVC600fixkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the default constructor of a nested class gets called, it causes the C2065
compiler error:

   'identifier' : undeclared identifier

RESOLUTION
==========

Please see the MORE INFORMATION section for a workaround.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.This problem was corrected in Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: Because constructors do not have names, they are never found during name
lookup; however an explicit type conversion using the functional notation causes
a constructor to be called to initialize an object. (This information came from
the C++ Working Paper.)

The following sample code demonstrates the problem and the workaround.

Sample Code
-----------

      /*
      Compile options: None
      */ 

      class Base
      {
      public:

          class Common
          {
          public:
             Common(){};
          };
          class Derived : public Common
          {
          public:
             Derived() {}
             Derived(int n) {}
          };
          Base( const Common &theCommon) {}
      };

      int main(void)
      {
          Base B1(Base::Derived());  //C2065 here

          // Workaround: Comment the above line
          // Uncomment the following lines
          // Base::Derived D ;
          // Base B1(D) ;
          return 0;
      }
