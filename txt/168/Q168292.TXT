TITLE   :XFOR: Err Msg: (RAS) Phone Book Cannot Be Opened
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access the Dial-up connections property page, the following
error message appears:

   The Remote Access Service (RAS) phone book cannot be opened. It must be
   accessible and in the system directory as
   \winnt\system32\ras\rasphone.pbk

You can successfully start the remote access service (RAS) from a command line,
and Winnt\System32\Ras\Rasphone.pbk exists and is accessible.

CAUSE
=====

The IMCAdmin extension attempts to open Rasphone.pbk based on a relative path
from the ADMIN$ share. If this share is missing or has been removed the IMCAdmin
extension will be unable to access the Rasphone.pbk file. This path is hardcoded
into the following extension:

   \\servername\admin$\system32\ras\rasphone.pbk

If the location of this file changes you will receive this error message.

Additional query words: fail
