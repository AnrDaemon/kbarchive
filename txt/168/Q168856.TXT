TITLE   :WD97: Background Texture Tab Doesn't Display Correct Path
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage winword word97 kbwdinternet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a background texture using a Web address to insert a custom
picture that is not one of the included backgrounds, the path for that picture
is not displayed correctly on the Texture tab.

When you insert a background graphic from a URL, for example
http://www.domain.com/picture.gif, the path to the picture is displayed as
//www.domain.com/picture, leaving off both the "http:" and the .gif extension.

WORKAROUND
==========

To insert a background texture:

1. On the Format menu, point to Background, and then click Fill Effects.

2. Click the Texture tab, and then click Other Texture.

3. Click to select a new texture, and then click OK.

4. Click OK to close the Fill Effects dialog box.

There is no way to change the path or to make it display correctly. This problem
does not change the functionality of the background image. The preview and the
background will display properly.

STATUS
======

We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you insert a background picture from a Web site into your HTML document,
Microsoft Word does not save the Web location (as displayed on the Texture tab)
as the source of the picture. Word will copy the picture to your local drive and
rename the picture to something similar to "Image37.gif." You can determine the
name of the background picture by viewing the HTML Source of your document and
by finding the "BACKGROUND = <file name>" statement.
