KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool dun win95 kbDialUp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start a communications program, you may receive one of the
following error messages:

   Error: port in use

   OpenComm: Port already open

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Rnaapp.exe is active in memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, follow these steps:

1. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to open the Close Program dialog box.

2. Click Rnaapp to select it, and then click End Task.

3. Start your communications program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you finish using a communications program and close the connection,
Rnaapp.exe is still running and the port remains unavailable to non-TAPI
programs.

Rnaapp.exe is left in memory to allow TAPI programs to open faster. Rnaapp.exe is
eventually unloaded from memory (unless Dial-Up Networking Server is set to
allow caller access), but it may take 10-15 minutes.
