TITLE   :New Synchronization Behavior with Windows NT Server Version 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Starting with Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, the synchronization
replication behavior for the security account manager (SAM) database, also known
as the user account database, has changed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Prior to Windows NT 4.0, full synchronization replication could be forced by
selecting a backup domain controller (BDC) in Server Manager and clicking
"Synchronize with Primary Domain Controller" in the Computer menu. Now, this
procedure triggers a partial synchronization if the PDC and BDC are both running
Windows NT Server 4.0. You can still force a full synchronization by typing the
following command at a command prompt on the BDC:

   net accounts /sync

You can also force a full synchronization by using the NLTEST utility from the
Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit:

   nltest /sync /server:<BDC_name>
