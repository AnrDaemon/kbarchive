TITLE   :BUG: Debugger Does Not Step Over to __finally Code Block
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbVC500bug kbVC600bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Integrated Debugger, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The debugger does not Step-Over to code in __finally block from a __try block.

CAUSE
=====

The __finally code is executed via a "call" instead of a "jmp instruction.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is to do a Step-Into (F11 key) instead of Step-Over (F10 key) in
the debugger.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Compile the following code with debug information.

       #include <iostream.h>

       void main ()
       {
      int counter=0;

       __try {

      counter++;//SET A BREAKPOINT HERE
      cout << "In try block" << endl;

             }

       __finally
             {
         counter++;
         cout << "In finally block" << endl;
             }

       cout << "Exit, counter=" << counter << endl;

       }

Set a breakpoint on the line shown above. Start the debugger with Debug Go or by
pressing the F5 key. Step-Over (or, press F10) from that point onward. The
debugger exits the program without going to the __finally block.
