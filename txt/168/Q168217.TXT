TITLE   :FIX: Unattended Setup May Fail with 3Com 3C619B Tokenlink III A
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A computer running Windows NT version 4.0 may fail during an unattended
installation of the 3Com 3C619B Tokenlink adapter with the following error:

   Badly formed setup script command

This problem is only encountered if you explicitly specify the 3C619B in an
Unattend.txt file. Using the DetectAdapers = "" entry does not exhibit the
problem.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by an incorrect entry in the Oemsetup.inf file of the
3C619B network adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Oemsetup.inf file for the 3C619B is located in the I386\Drvlib.nic\Tlnk3
directory on your installation source.

To correct the problem, follow the instructions listed below:

NOTE: The Oemsetup.inf file is read only. Be sure to change the attributes of the
file before editing.

1. Edit the Oemsetup.inf file located in the I386\Drvlib.nic\Tlnk3 directory.

2. Search for the string of STF_GUI_UNATTENDED. You should see the following
   entry:

      ifstr(i) $(!STF_GUI_UNATTENDED) == "YES"
                       NetworkAddress = ""
                       goto WriteNetworkAddr
               endif

3. Place a semi-colon at the beginning of the NetworkAddress = "" line to
   comment it out.

4. On the File menu, click Save the File, and then exit the program.
