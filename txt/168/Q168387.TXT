TITLE   :FIX: Exported Makefile May Be Useless if Custom Build Uses "CD"
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbide kbVC kbVC500bug kbVC600fix kbGrpDSToolskbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a custom build step uses the command "CD," the exported makefile does not
work.

CAUSE
=====

Makefiles are exported assuming that file paths are relative to the directory
with the project file. If a custom build step changes the current directory, the
relative file names will not be valid. Developer Studio does not automatically
insert a "CD" command to change back to the directory containing the project
file after a custom build rule.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you need to change the current directory in a custom build step and use an
exported makefile, make sure that you change the current directory back to the
project directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
version 6.0.
