KEYWORDS:kbhw osr2 win95 kbHardwarekbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) does not support the query/remove power
management function for CardBus cards. Therefore, SCSI (among others) cardbus
cards may cause the computer to seem to stop responding (hang) after resuming
from a suspended state.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CardBus network interface cards do not experience this behavior because these
cards' power management features are handled by the network interface driver.
All other CardBus cards may potentially cause this behavior.
