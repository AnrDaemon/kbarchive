PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Over time, the Windows NT system responsiveness appears sluggish, and clients
may report a gradual decrease in system performance.

By tracking the amount of private bytes for Rpcss.exe, it can be observed that
over time it increases without decreasing. This is viewable using Windows NT
Performance Monitor by choosing the following counter to monitor:

   Object:    Process
   Instance:  RPCSS
   Counter:   Private Bytes

CAUSE
=====

A UDP remote procedure call (RPC) datagram packet was received by the server and
the RPC service referenced in the packet is not running on the Windows NT server
computer. During processing of the RPC datagram packet, a small buffer was
allocated that was not freed.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- Tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
