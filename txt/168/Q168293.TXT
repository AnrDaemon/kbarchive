TITLE   :Zip Cartridges Formatted in LBA Mode are Unreadable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbhw kbsetup kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an Iomega Zip IDE Insider drive to re-partition and reformat a Zip
cartridge using LBA mode, the cartridge will be unreadable from other SCSI,
Parallel, IDE Zip drives (operating in non-LBA mode), or ATAPI Zip drives.

CAUSE
=====

The standard translated geometry for all Zip drives is 512 cylinders, 12 heads,
and 32 sectors per track. LBA translation of the drive geometry results in a
translated geometry of 97 cylinders, 32 heads, and 63 sectors per track. Zip
drives using standard Zip disk geometry will be unable to read the alternate
disk geometry presented by Zip cartridges formatted under LBA mode.


RESOLUTION
==========

In the computer's CMOS setup, disable LBA translation on the Zip IDE Insider
drive. Enter the correct cylinder, head, and sector information, as indicated
above.
