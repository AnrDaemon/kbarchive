TITLE   :XFOR: Cannot Reply to SMTP Mail Coming from the ccMail Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

With the cc:Mail SMTP gateway installed on a cc:Mail postoffice, if Microsoft
Exchange Server does not have the Internet Mail Service (IMS) installed,
Microsoft Exchange users can send and receive SMTP mail, but all replies to
incoming SMTP mail immediately result in non-delivery reports (NDRs).

CAUSE
=====

The cc:Mail Connector maps all addresses of the form "user@domain.domain AT
POname" to SMTP addresses. Therefore, the Microsoft Exchange user cannot reply
to SMTP mail messages coming from the cc:Mail SMTP gateway.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
