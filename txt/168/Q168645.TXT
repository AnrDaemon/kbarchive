TITLE   :Error: Please Insert the Compaq SSD into Drive "CD-ROM"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade a Compaq server from a Smart Start CD (that includes Compaq's
OEM version of Windows NT) to a retail copy of Microsoft Windows NT, you may get
the following error:

   Please insert the Compaq SSD into drive "CD-ROM".

where "CD-ROM" is your drive letter assignment for the CD-ROM.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused when the original installation of Windows NT came from a Compaq
Smart Start CD. The Compaq Software Support Diskette (SSD) is included on the
Compaq CD and was installed at the same time from one media. When an upgrade is
attempted from a non-Smart Start installation CD, it looks at the following
registry setting for the setup source path:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup
   SourcePath E:\ (CD drive enumeration)

RESOLUTION
==========

The Compaq SSD now needs to be installed from a disk. Since the upgrade is
looking for the CD (E: etc.) you cannot insert the disk into drive A: and
continue. To fix this, do one of the following:

 - Press the Esc key to finish the upgrade. Install the SSD from a disk later.

   -or-

 - Edit the registry key:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and locate the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup

2. Change the SourcePath to A:\ (do this before doing the upgrade).

3. Exit Registry Editor and restart your computer.

The upgrade process will then ask you to insert the SSD into drive A:\.
