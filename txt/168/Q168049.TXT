TITLE   :HyperTerminal Files Cannot Be Opened If No Modem Is Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Windows NT system has at least one COM port available, but no modems
installed, HyperTerminal will display an error that it cannot start Session file
"%s" when you execute a *.ht file. It will then proceed to start a new
connection. If you try to open one of these pre-configured files (*.ht) from
within HyperTerminal, it will start a new connection instead of using the
current connection.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
