SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a universal naming convention (UNC) HTML hyperlink in a Word
document, the linked file is opened in your Web Browser instead of in Word. For
example, if you click the following UNC link in a Word document

   \\MyMachine\MyShare\MyFile.html

the MyFile.html file is opened in a Web browser.
