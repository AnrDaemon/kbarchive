TITLE   :BUG: Setup Doesn't Ask to Register Environment Variables
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.1,4.2,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbVC500bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setup does not ask to register environment variables while doing a CD-ROM
installation. While installing Visual C++ in Windows NT, setup should ask if you
want the environment variables registered through a check box in a setup screen,
irrespective of the type of installation selected. During the CD-ROM
installation, this check box is not displayed and you do not get the opportunity
to register the environment variables.

NOTE: This check box is not displayed in any type of installation in Windows 95.

NOTE: CD-ROM installation option is not available for Visual C++ 6.0, and
therefore, this bug doesn't apply to Visual C++ 6.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the Vcvars32.bat file in the ..\BIN directory found in the installed
directory under ..\MSDEV or ..\DevStudio\VC. This file contains the environment
variables required to run build tools from a command prompt.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During setup, a screen with the following message appears:

   For your convenience, the environment variables required to run build tools
   from a command prompt are saved in VCVARS32.BAT in your BIN directory.

This message is followed by a check box for "Register Environment Variables."

The following message appears after you select the check box:

   Turn on this option to register environment variables for running Microsoft
   Visual C++ tools from the command line.

NOTE: In Visual C++ 5.0, the Profiler may not run from Developer Studio if the
environment variables are not registered. For additional information about the
Source Profiler in C++ 5.0, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
