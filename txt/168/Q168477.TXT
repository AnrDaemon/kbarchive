TITLE   :"Cannot Access This Folder. Path Is Too Long" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to log on to a computer running Windows NT 4.0, you receive the
following error:

   Cannot access this folder. Path is too long.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if the system administrator uses System Policy Editor to
create a policy that sets the Hide Network Neighborhood Icon option and
specifies that Custom Shared Folders or Custom Folders use an UNC connection to
connect to a share on a central server. The above error message occurs because
the Hide Network Neighborhood Icon option removes the ability to use UNC names
for connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

One solution is to map the drive through a login script and change the
specification in the Custom Shared Folders, or the Custom Folders location, to
reference this drive letter.

For example, D:\CUSTOM\Programs.

To get the mapped drive to work correctly, you might have to check the box for
"Run logon scripts synchronously" under "Windows NT System" in the policy. This
will allow the logon script to execute before the shell is loaded.

Another solution is to allow users to have the Network Neighborhood Icon on the
desktop. Clear the check box to allow the user's policy to not hide the Network
Neighborhood icon.

Other causes of this error message include file permissions.

See article Q148437 to set the NTFS permissions for the %SystemRoot% directory
back to the system defaults.
