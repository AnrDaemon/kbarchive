PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0

KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you configure the Directory Replication Connector between two untrusted
domains, you may see one of the following error messages:

   DS_E_COMMUNICATIONS_PROBLEM

-OR-

   DS_E_INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS_RIGHTS

Sample configuration:

   DOMAINa/SiteA/ServerA - Exchange Server (Windows NT PDC)
   DOMAINb/SiteB/ServerB - Exchange Server (Windows NT Member Server)

You can successfully configure a Directory Replication Connector on the member
ServerB (Site2) if you select NOT to configure the directory replication
connector on Server A. When you attempt to create the directory replication on
ServerA (Windows NT PDC) to ServerB (Windows NT member server) you may receive
the following error:

   DS_E_COMMUNICATIONS_PROBLEM.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Configure both directory replication connectors from ServerB.

2. Create a duplicate account with the same name and password on ServerA (the
   Windows NT PDC) that also resides on ServerB. This account will be used to
   configure the Directory Replication Connector on Server A from Server B.

3. On ServerA, give the newly created user account permissions at the
   Organization, Site and Configuration containers. Select role of Permissions
   Admin at each level.

4. Log on to ServerB with the account that was created on ServerA.

5. On ServerB (the Windows NT member server), in the Exchange Server
   Administrator program, create a new directory replication connector. Click
   Yes to configure the directory replication connector on ServerA.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Ensure that mail is flowing from SiteA to SiteB and from SiteB to SiteB before
you attempt to set up the directory replication connector.
