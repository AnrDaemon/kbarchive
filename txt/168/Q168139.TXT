TITLE   :XFOR: IMS Inbound Mail Communication Problem
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on to Microsoft Exchange Server using Microsoft Exchange
Client, the attempt does not complete. You cannot use Mdbvu32.exe to log on
either. You may notice that the Internet Mail Service (IMS) shuts down without
logging any error messages.

CAUSE
=====

A message with bad MIME headers and bad TNEF causes the store to go into an
infinite rewind loop. This causes store deadlock once Windows NT Server
terminates the bad thread.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

Inbound messages will not be moved to MTS-IN and outbound messages will not be
picked up from MTS-OUT.

You can see which Windows NT services are running by using the Control Panel
Services tool. You will notice that the Internet Mail service has shut down. You
can see that it did not log any events in the Windows NT Event Log by running
the Windows NT Event Viewer.
