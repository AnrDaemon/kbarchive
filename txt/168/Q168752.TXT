TITLE   :SNA Windows 95 3.0 SP1 3270 Applet Print Option Doesn't Print
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server Windows 95 client, version 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The 3270 applet included with the SNA Server Windows 95 client version 3.0
Service Pack 1 does not correctly perform a print screen when you click Print on
the File menu. This only occurs when the client is installed on Windows 95
systems. If the SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 1 Windows 95 client is installed on
a Windows NT system, the print screen function prints correctly.

The print output is a blank page or a page containing part of the data contained
on the 3270 screen.

CAUSE
=====

The StartPage printer API resets some of the printer settings in Windows 95,
which causes the print screen to fail.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Use the 3270 applet included with the SNA Server Windows 95 client version
   3.0 (without SP1).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows 95 SNA Server client
version 3.0 Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
