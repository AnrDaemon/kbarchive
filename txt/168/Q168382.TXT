SYMPTOMS
========

NOTE: This information has not been confirmed by Microsoft. The information in
this article is provided as-is and is subject to change without notice.

In some cases, when you use the Stop Build command while you are building a
project, files that are created by the build process are corrupted. Some of the
problems reported to Microsoft, but unconfirmed, include zero-sized output files
(PDB, BSC, OBJ, etc.) and possible loss of data in project source files.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is difficult to reproduce, and occurs very rarely. However, it is
always a good idea to maintain a backup of your project to be safe.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
