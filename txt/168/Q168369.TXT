   Microsoft PCM Converter

To disable an audio codec, do the following:

1. Click the Start button and point to Settings.

2. Click Control Panel.

3. Double-click Multimedia.

4. On the Advanced (Devices in Windows 98) tab, click the plus (+) sign next to
   Audio Compression Codecs to display a listing of installed audio codecs.

5. Select the audio codecs you wish to disable, and then click the Properties
   button.

6. Select the Do Not Use This Audio Codec option and click OK.
