TITLE   :XCLN: Formatting on Incoming Internet E-mail Is Wrong
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0;WinNT:4.0;Win95:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The formatting, word wrapping, or horizontal spacing in Internet e-mail messages
received by Microsoft Exchange Client may be incorrect; they appear different
from the way they were composed.

CAUSE
=====

The original e-mail message may have come from a system such as a mainframe
e-mail system that uses a fixed format system font for composing messages. When
the message is received at the Exchange client, the formatting and horizontal
spacing of the characters appear differently because of font mapping.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

 - In Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0, change the default font for incoming
   Internet e-mail to a fixed format by checking the Use Fixed-Width Font option
   in the Internet Mail tab of the Internet Mail Service properties.

   NOTE: The Use Fixed-Width Font setting does not apply to RTF and HTML
   messages.

   -OR-

 - Install the Exchange Server Preview Pane Extension (tripane extension),
   available in the Exchange Server Resource Kit. The Preview Pane Extension
   supports a fixed font setting. The Resource Kit can be downloaded from the
   following location:
