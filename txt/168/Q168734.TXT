KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to synchronize all folders from a Microsoft Exchange or Outlook
Client with an OST file, you may encounter the following error message:

   Synchronization with the offline folder file could not be
   completed. Consult the synchronization log in the deleted
   items folder for details.

Reviewing the synchronization log shows the following:

   11:43:26 Synchronizing Organization Forms
   11:43:27 Error synchronizing folder
   11:43:27 [8004010F-501-0-521]
   11:43:27 The client operation failed.
   11:43:27 Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store

This error occurs after you upgrade to Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0.
This error occurs if the upgraded computer contains the Organizational Forms
Library and the Organizational Forms Library has the Default permission set to
NONE.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Change the Default permission for the Organizational Forms Library to any
   other Role besides NONE and then change the Role back to NONE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
