PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a hotfix for Windows NT version 4.0 using the Hotfix.exe tool,
the following error message may occur:

   Hotfix:The fix is already installed. Hotfix:Internal consistency error:
   Invalid Tree pointer = <xxx>

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs when the hotfix has already been applied or a hotfix
with an identical name has been installed. The Hotfix.exe tool cannot write the
information in the registry because the key already exists.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the previous installation before reapplying a hotfix. To remove the
previous installation, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click Command Prompt.

2. Change to the folder in which the hotfix you want to remove is located.

3. Type either of the following lines:

    - hotfix.exe /remove

    - hotfix.exe /r


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Hotfix.exe tool creates a Hotfix folder in the Winnt folder. In that folder,
each hotfix has its own folder containing the replaced file or files.

Hotfix.exe is a tool that makes the installation, tracking, and maintenance of
hotfixes easier.

The command syntax for Hotfix.exe is:

Hotfix [ /H /R /V ] [<hotfix name>]
Hotfix /I  [source dir]
Hotfix [\\computername] [ /L /F ] [<hotfix name>]

   /Full    or /F  Specifies a full listing. Default is brief.
   /Help /H or /?  Displays this message.
   /Install or /I  Installs the hotfix identified by the Hotfix.ini file
                   in the <source dir>, or the current directory in the

                   on the local computer.
   /List    or /L  Displays a list of all installed hotfixes. If a
                   hotfix name is specified, a detailed listing of the
                   specific hotfix is displayed.
   /Remove  or /R  Removes the specified hotfix from the local computer.

                   installed on the local computer. If no hotfix name is

   \\computername  The name of a remote Windows NT computer that will be
                   the target of the command.  This can only be used with
                   the /LIST command option.
