SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a Word document, the bookmark at the end of the document may be
lost. This problem occurs when either of the following conditions exist:

 - The document you save contains header or footer text, but the body of the
   document is blank except for the bookmark.

   -or-

 - You open and save the document in another version of Word, and the document
   contains text in the header or footer and a bookmark after the body text at
   the end of the document.

NOTE: This problem does not occur if you have never typed text in the header or
footer of the document. If you type text in the header or footer and then delete
the text, the problem still occurs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add the bookmark back to the end of the document
after you add text to the body of the document or after you have saved the
document in a different version of Word.

STATUS
======
