TITLE   :XFOR: Event ID 68 Running cc:Mail DirSync
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run directory synchronization (dirsync) with the Microsoft Exchange
Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, the following event may appear in the event log:

   Event ID: 68
   Source: MSExchangeCCMC
   Type: Error
   Category: General
   Description: Lotus cc:Mail EXPORT to file CCMDIR.EXP returned result code 1.
   Could not access the Lotus cc:Mail Post Office.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when you are using the wrong version of Import.exe and
Export.exe. The problem can also occur when you are using the correct versions
of the files, but the wrong versions are selected in the properties of the
Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are connecting to a Lotus cc:Mail DB6 post office, the Exchange Server
computer must be running Import.exe version 5.15 and Export.exe version 5.14. In
addition, in the properties of the Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, on the
Post Office tab, "Import 5.15/Export 5.14" must be selected.

If you are connecting to a Lotus cc:Mail DB8 post office, the Exchange Server
computer must be running Import.exe and Export.exe version 6.0 or later. In
addition, in the properties of the Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, on the
Post Office tab, "Import 6.0/Export 6.0" must be selected.

To select a different version in the properties of the connector, follow these
steps:

1. Start the Administrator program. To do so, click Start, point to Programs,
   point to Microsoft Exchange, and then click Microsoft Exchange Administrator.

2. In the left pane, click the Connections object under the appropriate site. In
   the right pane, click the Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, and then on
   the File menu, click Properties. Note that the Connections object appears
   under the Configuration object.

3. On the Post Office tab, under "Import/Export version", select the appropriate
   version.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Please contact Lotus for information about obtaining the correct versions of the
cc:Mail Import.exe and Export.exe utilities.
