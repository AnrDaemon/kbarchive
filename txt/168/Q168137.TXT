TITLE   :XCON: Exchange to MCI and Sprint Interoperability
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Messages sent from Microsoft Exchange Server X.400 Connector to MCI and then
relayed to Sprint (telemail) may have problems and subsequently get rejected by
Sprint's message transfer agent (MTA). However, no non-delivery report (NDR) is
generated by the Sprint MTA. The message is then placed in Sprint's MTA bad mail
directory.

CAUSE
=====

Sprint MTAs do not accept messages containing Per-Domain-Bilateral information.

When MCI relays the message, a service downgrade from the 1988 standard to the
1984 standard takes place so Sprint can accept the message. MCI MTAs should then
discard the bilateral domain information in the P1 but do not, causing Sprint
MTAs to reject the message. No NDR by Sprint MTA is possible because Sprint is
no longer able to read the originator/recipient (O/R) address from the P1, which
would be malformed in this instance.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft Exchange MTA can be configured to suppress generation of Per-
Domain-Bilateral information at the originating Exchange Server MTA.

To disable the Per-Domain-Bilateral information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
