TITLE   :FIX: Localize Sample Can Not Be Built
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbVC500bug kbvfp600fixkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Building the Localize sample from a command prompt using NMAKE generates the
following errors:

   "Localize.mak(26) : fatal error U1050:

   An invalid configuration is specified. Stop"

   "NMAKE : fatal error U1077:

   '"C:\Program Files\DevStudio\VC\BIN\NMAKE.EXE"' : return code '0x2'"

Building the Localize sample from within Developer Studio causes the warning:

   The following environment variables were not found $(OUTDIR)

CAUSE
=====

The first error occurs because the default makefile is missing the
configurations for the Locresde.mak and Locresfr.mak files.

The second problem is caused by an undefined macro called $(OUTDIR) listed in the
Additional resource include directories.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you need to build from the command line, then invoke NMAKE separately on each
of the project makefiles. For example:

       nmake /f localize.mak
       nmake /f locresde.mak
       nmake /f locresfr.mak

To eliminate the warning about $(OUTDIR), from the Project menu, click Settings,
and then highlight Localize Project and click the Resources tab. Remove
$(OUTDIR) from the Additional resource include directories.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0
for Windows.
