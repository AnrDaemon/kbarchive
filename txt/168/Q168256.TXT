The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Using the FoxPro RUN command, it is possible to programmatically launch a
Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking connection.

MORE INFORMATION
================


The following syntax can be used to launch a Dial-Up Networking (DUN)
connection:

      RUN /N Rundll Rnaui.dll,RnaDial <your DUN connection name>

For a connection named Test, use the following command to launch this
connection:

      RUN /N Rundll Rnaui.dll,RnaDial Test

The function call RnaDial and the connection name are both case-sensitive.

NOTE: Although there is a function within the Rnaui.dll file that enables you to
programmatically dial, a function that allows you to programmatically disconnect
is not available.

To view the functions available within Rnaui.dll or any .dll file, find the file,
use the right mouse button (right-click) to select the file, and select
QuickView. You can view the available programmatic functions from the listing
under Export Table.

If QuickView is not available as a selection then QuickView needs to be
installed. You can install QuickView using the Control Panel by selecting
Add/Remove Programs, and then selecting the Windows 95 (or Windows NT) Setup
tab. Next, click Accessories and select QuickView.

Below is the Export Table of available functions from the Rnaui.dll file:
