   box, click to select the Link To File, Save With Document, and Float Over
   Text check boxes.

2. Cut the picture to the Clipboard and paste it into the main body of the
   document.

3. Edit and save the picture in its native editor.

4. Update the picture in Word.

5. Save the document as another version.

Word may stop responding if you close the document and then reopen any version of
the document other than the first version.

stop responding or do not open that version.

   stop responding, and click Delete.

3. Click Yes on the Confirm Version Delete message, and then click OK.
