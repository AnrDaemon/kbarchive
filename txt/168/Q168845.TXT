PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When adding a Windows NT version 3.51 or 4.00 client into a Systems Management
Server version 1.2 Site a Windows NT event 3031 will be created in the System
Event log of the client. The description of event 3031 is as follows:

   The redirector was unable to delete the file specified on server
   SMSLOGONSERVER when it was closed by the application. The data contains the
   name of the file.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server Windows NT client setup program Cli_nt.exe, during
the creation of a Client Configuration Request (CCR), will create a client
access token file in the Ccr.box directory on the client's logon server. The
access token file named using the clients SMSID (Smsid.tok) is created using a
flag FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE. When the handle to this file is closed the file
is deleted. Although the file has been deleted the Windows NT redirector
attempts to remove this file which returns event 3031.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post additional information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.

A supported fix is now available for Windows NT version 4.0, but has not been
fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
