SUMMARY
=======

You can use the -d switch on Analyze.exe to delete unnecessary files from the
database. This switch will not delete all unnecessary files, only those that
meet a certain condition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under most circumstances, when you delete a file from a SourceSafe project it
will delete the associated file pair from the SourceSafe database (usually the
VSS\DATA directory.)

However, if a file is branched to another project and then deleted, SourceSafe
does not delete the associated file pair from the database because it needs
those files to maintain the history of the branched version.

Even when the branched version is subsequently deleted, its associated file pair
is not deleted.

The only time the -d switch on Analyze will delete files from the SourceSafe
database is when it detects a file that was involved in a branch at one point,
and no branched versions of the file are now active (not deleted) in the project
tree.
