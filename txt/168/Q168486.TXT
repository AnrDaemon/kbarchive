TITLE   :16-bit Applications May Fail after HP ScanJet Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the HP ScanJet Software version 2.5, 16-bit Windows-based
applications may not start. When you double-click the application icon or
executable file, the hourglass pointer appears for about ten seconds, but the
application does not start.

If you open an MS-DOS command prompt from within Windows NT and attempt to start
an MS-DOS application such as the MS-DOS Edit utility, the application fails to
start. The cursor temporarily freezes, and then eventually begins blinking again
at the command prompt.

CAUSE
=====

The setup program of HPScanJet version 2.5 may add extra characters in the
FILES= line of the CONFIG.NT file located in the <WinRoot>\System32
folder. This affects the WOW (16-bit application) subsystem in Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the extra characters in the FILES= line of CONFIG.NT so that the entry
looks like the following:

   FILES = 20

You do not have to restart the computer for this change to take effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

HP ScanJet is manufactured by Hewlett-Packard, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
