TITLE   :Number of Copies Option Is Unavailable When Printing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0 95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print multiple copies of a document, the option to specify the
number of copies in the Print dialog box may be unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

The printer does not have the ability to hold all the information for a complete
page in memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a program that handles printing multiple pages internally (such as Microsoft
Word), or use a printer that can hold an entire page in its internal memory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Dot-matrix and inkjet printers print one line at a time. When information is
sent to these printers, it is printed immediately. The printer memory is then
overwritten with the next line of data. Dot-matrix and inkjet printers cannot
print multiple copies of a page because the information for the page does not
remain in memory.

Laser printers print an entire page at one time, so all of the information for
the page is held in the printer's memory. Laser printers can print multiple
copies because the print job is still in the printer's memory.
