SUMMARY
=======

The Systems Management Server 2.0 Installer included with Systems Management
Server Service Pack 1, includes functionality for complex expressions and
operators.

Using complex expressions and operators, you can create variables for your
installation script that you could not otherwise create. You can also use
complex expressions to assign an integer or a string value to a variable. You
can use complex operators when you are using the Set Variable script item to
assign a Boolean value to a variable. You use complex operators to present a
conditional statement for assigning a variable.

If the condition of the statement is met, then a Boolean value of 1 is assigned
to the variable. If the condition of the statement is not met, then a Boolean
value of zero is assigned to the variable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For descriptions on available expressions and examples of use, refer to Systems
Management Server Installer Help.

This functionality is included in versions of Systems Management Server Installer
2.0.80.00 and higher.
