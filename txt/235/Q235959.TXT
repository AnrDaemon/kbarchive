TITLE   :SNA Server Fails to Reestablish Session Under Certain Conditions
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0 SP1,4.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp3fix sna4 kbsna400sp1 kbsna400sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to reestablish a disconnected session may fail unless the connection
is stopped and restarted.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server does not correlate Host SSCP responses to the original SSCP request
if the response is unexpected.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server, versions
4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 4.0
Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The symptoms described above can only be seen when the Host is sending an
unexpected response.

In the case reported, the message flow looks as follows:

Host                     SNA Server
===================================
ACTLU RQD       ->

                <-       ACTLU +RSP

                <-       NOTIFY SLU enabled

INITSELF -RSP   ->  
with sense code 0857 0002, SSCP - PLU session not active

NOTIFY +RSP     ->

The message flow shows that the Host is sending an INITSELF -RSP in error, which
is unexpected as a Response to a NOTIFY Request. However, SNA Server treats this
unexpected Response as a Response to its NOTIFY Request. At this point, the Host
and the SNA Server are not synchronized any more as far as this session is
concerned.

Additional query words: reconnect hangs correlator sequence
