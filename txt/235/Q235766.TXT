KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Since Microsoft's Systems Management Server version 2.0 is a network management
application, there is a need to be able to install an Administrator's Console on
various Windows NT computers throughout the organization.

If the CD-ROM is not available and you attempt to install Systems Management
Server Administrator Console from the x:\SMS\Bin\i386 directory on the site
server, the following Dr. Watson may be generated:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.
   unknown
   Exception access violation (0xc0000005), Address 0x004d79ea

STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server version
2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for Systems
Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: This fix prevents Dr. Watson error messages to be generated when using
Setup.exe from the x:\SMS\Bin\i386 directory on the site server. You should not
use Setup.exe from this location to install the Systems Management Server
Administrator console. Use the Systems Management Server CD to install a remote
Systems Management Server Administrator console.
