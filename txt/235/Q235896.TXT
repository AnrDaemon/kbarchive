SUMMARY
=======

After you uninstall Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5), some files
intentionally are not removed or reverted back to the version previous to SP5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most of the files are not removed because changes made to the Security Accounts
Manager (SAM) and the security registry hives that are not backed out require
the SP5 version of the files. You must not remove the files after SP5 is applied
unless you fully restore your computer to its previous installation of Windows
NT 4.0.
