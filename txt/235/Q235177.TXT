TITLE   :Windows NT or 2000 Clients Do Not Start Client Components
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbClient kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbAdvertisement kbPackage kbSoftwareDist kbsmsMeter

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A logged on Microsoft Windows NT or Windows 2000 client does not receive
advertised packages, or does not correctly process Software Metering (SWM) rules
set for the Systems Management Server (SMS) Site.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the user was logged on when Windows NT Remote Client
Installation installed the SMS services and components. The Advertised Programs
Monitor (Smsmon32.exe) and the SMS client component launcher (Launch32.exe) must
run in the user context. These processes can be started only in the user-context
mode when the user logs on to the computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use one (or more) of the following methods:

 - Log off, and then log back on to the Windows NT-based computer.

 - In the Windows NT Control Panel, start the Advertised Programs Monitor.

 - Start Launch32.exe from the following location:

   %Windir%\Ms\Sms\Core\Bin

MORE INFORMATION
================

If these workarounds do not resolve this issue, review
%Windir%\Ms\Sms\Logs\Launch32.log for possible causes.
