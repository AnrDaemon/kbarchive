KEYWORDS:kbdocerr kbClient kbServer kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft BackOffice 4.5 Resource Kit Books Online incorrectly documents the
location of the Hardware Inventory Agent log (Hinv.log) file and the Client
Component Installation Manager log (Ccim.log) file. The Microsoft BackOffice 4.5
Resource Kit Books Online incorrectly list these files as residing on the site
server in the \Sms\Logs folder.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, note that the Hinv.log and Ccim.log files actually
reside on client computers in the Windows\Ms\Sms\Logs folder.
