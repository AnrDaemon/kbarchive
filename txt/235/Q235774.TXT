TITLE   :SMS: Hierarchy Is Unsynchronized After Package Deletion
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0

KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200fix kbPackage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Packages that are deleted at a Parent Site Server may become orphaned at child
sites if the child site does not process the replication instructions to delete
the package.

This could happen for any number of reasons such as the Central site
administrator deleting a package while a child site was offline. The child sites
will still show these packages in the console and it is not possible to delete
them.

If logging is enabled for Distribution Manager, it will show entries similar to
the following:

~SQL Msg #3606> Arithmetic overflow occurred.~ $<SMS_DISTRIBUTION_MANAGER>
~SQL Msg #99901> This PkgID (40100002) does not exist in the parent table, SMSPackages.~  $$<SMS_DISTRIBUTION_MANAGER>

This can also cause performance problems for the child site servers when they are
trying to process and maintain these orphaned packages.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not delete packages from the parent site unless all child site servers are
online.
