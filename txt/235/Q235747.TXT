KEYWORDS:kbdocerr kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server Resource Guide, Chapter 22: Software Metering
Flowcharts, page 593, in the last paragraph, it incorrectly states:

   "Software license limits will not be enforced until the initial trend has
   been calculated, unless the DO NOT ENFORCE LICENSE LIMITS FOR THIS PRODUCT
   UNTIL A TREND HAS BEEN CALCULATED checkbox in the Software Metering
   Properties dialog box in the SMS Administrator console is cleared."

There is no check box in the Software Metering Properties dialog box labeled "DO
NOT ENFORCE LICENSE LIMITS FOR THIS PRODUCT UNTIL A TREND HAS BEEN CALCULATED".
The check box exists in the Software Metering console under Metered Software,
Licensed Software properties (specific for each product)and the License
Balancing tab.

version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
