TITLE   :DNS Server Delegations Disappear on Secondary Name Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a Domain Name System (DNS) server hosting secondary zones for parent
and child domains, deleting the child domain removes the delegation for the
child domain from the the parent or <root> domain.

For example, if your DNS server hosts the following secondary zones

 - domain.net (root domain)

 - child.domain.net (child domain)

and you delete child.domain.net from the secondary server, the NS delegation for
child.domain.net is deleted from the domain.net zone.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the copy of the zone is running in memory.

NOTE: This is not written back to the zone file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the following syntax at a command line:

net stop dns

net start dns

Using this syntax stops and starts the DNS service, which reloads the parent or
<root> zone, and the NS delegation record reappears.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Windows NT 4.0.
