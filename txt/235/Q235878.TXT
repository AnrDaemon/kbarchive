PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

OSPF authentication using a "null" password by Windows NT Routing and Remote
Access Server (RRAS) may not work when trying to authenticate with third-party
OSPF routers with authentication disabled.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because by default passwords are enabled and the password
is "12345678".

RESOLUTION
==========

To disable OSPF Authentication:

1. Start the Routing and RAS Administration tool, expand IP Routing, and then
   right-click "OSPF by Bay Networks".

2. Click Configure OSPF, click the Areas tab, click the area, click Configure,
   and then click to clear the "Enable clear-text password" check box.

3. Quit the Routing and RAS Administration tool.
