TITLE   :ScardGetStatusChange() API Causes Deadlock in Smart Card RM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Smart Card Resource Manager may stop responding (hang) in the following
situation:

There are two processes (A and B) each with a single thread gaining access to the
same card (in the same reader) simultaneously. Each of the processes runs the
following sequence in a finite loop:

   SCardEstablishContext
   SCardConnect
   SCardGetStatusChange(SCARD_STATE_UNWARE,.....)
   SCardBeginTransaction
   SCARDTransmit (many times)
   .....
   SCardEndTransaction
   SCardDisconnect
   SCardReleaseContext

The two processes run exactly the same code. After running the code for several
minutes (from 2 to 15 minutes), the two processes hang and no other program may
be able to gain access to the same reader. However, another reader connected to
the system can be accessed through the Resource manager.

Even if you are forced to quit the two programs, the reader is still
inaccessible. To "unblock" the reader, the computer must either be restarted or
you must quit the Resource Manager program through a utility like Pview.exe. You
can also use Task Manager and then restart Resource Manager. If you quit then
restart Resource Manager, the two other programs are immediately unblocked.
