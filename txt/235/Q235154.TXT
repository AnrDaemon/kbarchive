KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbsetup kbClient kbRemote kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbHelpDesk kbUpgrade kbRemoteP

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade from Microsoft Windows 3.11 to Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows
98, the 16-bit remote control client components for Microsoft Systems Management
Server (SMS) 2.0 remain on the client.

CAUSE
=====

SMS 2.0 installs Windows 3.11 as a 16-bit system, but Windows 95 and Windows 98
are installed as 32-bit systems. Both versions of the remote control components
can not co-exist on the same computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

Before upgrading Windows 3.11 to Windows 95 or Windows 98, manually remove the
16-bit client components by using Smsman16, which can be found on the
SMSlogon\x86.bin\0000409\ share of any SMS 2.0 logon point.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
