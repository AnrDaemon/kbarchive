SUMMARY
=======

When you want to use Systems Management Server (SMS) inventory capabilities, you
can start an inventory agent manually or by using the Cliutils.exe command-line
utility.

The Cliutils.exe utility is included in the Support\Reskit\Bin\I386\Diagnose
folder of the SMS CD-ROM. If you are using an SMS 2.0 Service Pack distribution,
this file is installed along with the other supportability files when
Support.exe is executed. The Cliutils.exe utility is also included with the
Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit version 4.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To initiate an inventory cycle, run Cliutils.exe with the appropriate
command-line switches to force a cycle. For example, use one of the following
commands to start an inventory cycle:

cliutils /start "Software Inventory Agent"

"cliutils /start "Hardware Inventory Agent"" (without the quotation marks)

This forces a normal inventory for the selected inventory agent to begin
immediately.

This functionality can be used to troubleshoot inventory flow back to the site
server or to update inventory for a given computer after a software distribution
has taken place. This permits administrators to take advantage of dynamic
collections.

For more information about the Cliutils.exe utility, use the /? parameter or see
Chapter 13 in the Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0 Resource Guide.
