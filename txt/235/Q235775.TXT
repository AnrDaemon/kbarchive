TITLE   :SMS: Network Discovery Using SNMP May Fail to Discover Device
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200fix kbDiscovery

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to discover resources with
Network Discovery in Systems Management Server 2.0, you may notice that not all
clients are discovered as expected. If partial data has already been discovered
for the client through SNMP, then a Discovery Data Record will not be created
even if Network Discovery can obtain complete discovery information from the
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache of a device through SNMP.

This means that if initial SNMP discovery process does not get the subnet mask
from a client through SNMP, it will discard information retrieved from a devices
ARP cache even if it contains this information.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a flag being set during the Network Discovery cycle when a
client is first discovered. This flag causes Network Discovery to discard any
other information retrieved through SNMP.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
