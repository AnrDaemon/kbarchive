   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to apply a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack on a Key
Management (KM) server, the following error message may be displayed when the
Update.exe program attempts to determine which version of the Kmserver.exe file
is installed on the computer:

   The system cannot find the file specified.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the KM server password has been added to the
ImagePath registry value under the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeKMS

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the KM server password from the ImagePath registry value. To do so, use
the following steps.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the ImagePath value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeKMS

3. On the Edit menu, click String, remove the KM server password, and then click
   OK. When you are finished modifying the value, it should contain the full
   path to Kmserver.exe file only. By default, the value is set to
   C:\Exchsrvr\Bin\Kmserver.exe.

4. Quit Registry Editor.
