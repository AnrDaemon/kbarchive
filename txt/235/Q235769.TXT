======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 Administrator's Guide,
the documentation indicates that inboxes exist on the SMSLOGON share.

The following statement appears on page 99 of the Administrator's Guide in table
4.1: "These inboxes are found below the SMSLOGON share: Ccr.box, Ddr.box,
Inventory.box, Sinv.box, and Statusmsg.box". This is found under the Default
Directory Permissions heading for the SMSLOGON Share name.

The remainder of the information on this page is accurate. Only Ddr.box is found
on the SMSLOGON share and Ccr.box, Inventory.box, Sinv.box, or Statusmsg.box.
Note that if Windows Networking Logon Discovery method is enabled, the Ddr.box
is found. If Windows Networking Logon Discovery is not enabled, then there is no
Ddr.box at all. The table has been corrected to show that the SMSLOGON share has
the following directories: Alpha, ALPHA.bin, Config, DDR.BOX, i386, Logs, Sites,
x86.bin, and Sitescfg.

Inboxes are only found on site systems that act as client access points (CAPs)
and on the site server itself.

This information was also incorrect in the online Help and has since been
corrected. In the online Administrator's Guide, this fix appears in the
following topic: "Using Windows NT File and Directory Security".
