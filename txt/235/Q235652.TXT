TITLE   :XADM: Constrain Violation Adding Accounts to Permissions Tab
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you add many Windows NT accounts on the Permissions tab of an object in the
Exchange Server Administrator program, you may get the following error message:

   An internal processing error has occurred: constraint violation. The value
   specified for an attribute is either too big, too small, or not valid.
   Microsoft Exchange Directory
   ID No: DS_E_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create a Windows NT group and add the Windows NT
accounts to which you want to give permissions to that group. Then, add the
Windows NT group to the Permissions tab.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT accounts added to an object's Permissions tab are stored in the
NT-Security-Descriptor attribute for the object. The maximum length of the
attribute NT-Security-Descriptor in the Exchange Server directory is 4096 bytes.
If many Windows NT accounts are added to the Permissions tab, the length of the
value for the attribute NT-Security-Descriptor can exceed 4096 bytes, and when
you try to save the value, the error is logged.
