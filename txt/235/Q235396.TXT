SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to determine the first Exchange Server computer in a
site by running the Exchange Server Administrator program in Raw mode to assist
you in troubleshooting many different System folder issues. You can perform this
procedure on any Exchange Server computer in the site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The identity of the first Exchange Server computer in the site is usually known.
However, in some situations, because of administration or server configuration
changes, the identity of the first Exchange Server computer in the site may be
unknown.

To determine the first Exchange Server computer in the site, use the following
steps:

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin
/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by
   typing the following at a command prompt:

   "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r" (without the quotation marks)

2. In the Configuration container for the site, click Information Store Site
   Configuration.

3. On the File menu, click Raw Properties.

4. In the "Object attributes" section, find the Site-Folder-Server attribute.

5. The name of the server in the Edit Value area is the first Exchange Server
   computer in the site.

NOTE: If the first Exchange Server computer in the site is removed from the site
but is still listed, it may have been removed incorrectly. For information about
how to correctly remove the first Exchange Server computer, refer to the
