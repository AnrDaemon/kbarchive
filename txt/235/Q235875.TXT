TITLE   :XADM: Japanese Characters Appear as Vertical Bars in Admin.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view information in the Exchange Server Administrator program, some of
the characters appear as vertical dark bars.

This happens when you view information in the U.S. version of the Administrator
program on a computer running the U.S. version of Exchange Server that has
directory information replicated to it from a Japanese version Exchange Server
computer.

CAUSE
=====

The Japanese code page is not installed on the U.S. version server or the MS
Mincho font is not being used by the Exchange Server Administrator program.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the Japanese code page on the U.S. version Exchange Server computer, and
in the Exchange Server Administrator program, on the View menu, click Font, and
select MS Mincho.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the MS Mincho font allows the U.S. version of the Exchange Server
Administrator program to display the Japanese information correctly, instead of
with vertical bars.
