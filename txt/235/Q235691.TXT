TITLE   :FIX: The MSMQ - MQSeries Bridge Will Discard the EPSend Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::; WINDOWS:4.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMSMQ100 kbMQSeriesBridge

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSMQ - MQSeries Bridge 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the EPSend sample was compiled with the MQSeries 5.0 header file Cmqc.h, its
messages would be discarded and never reach Microsoft Message Queue Server
(MSMQ).

CAUSE
=====

When reading the extension property of a message, the MSMQ - MQSeries Bridge
used an internal MQSeries 2.0 MQMD structure. Therefore, it would return a
buffer too small error and the MSMQ - MQSeries Bridge would discard the message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for SNA Server
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
