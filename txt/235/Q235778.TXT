PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server client installation fails on Windows NT 3.51
workstations. If logging is enabled for the client configuration manager
component, the log will contain an error such as the following:

   --> Attempting to connect to administrative share '\\TESTCLI\admin$' using
   account 'TESTDOM\SMSService' SMS_CLIENT_CONFIG_MANAGER ---> Connected to
   administrative share on machine TESTCLI using account 'TESTDOM\SMSService'
   SMS_CLIENT_CONFIG_MANAGER ---> Invalid NT version "3.51" on machine
   "TESTCLI" SMS_CLIENT_CONFIG_MANAGER

CAUSE
=====

When the Systems Management Server site server is configured to use an
alternative "Number-decimal symbol" in regional settings, the client
configuration manager component (CCM) fails to properly interpret the version of
the potential client and thus aborts the installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
