TITLE   :INF:Sample TCP/IP CICS Concurrent Server Program Writes Log Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 4.0 SP2 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Cicscs.cbl, Imsexpl.cbl, and Mscmtics.cbl comprise a set of sample COBOL
programs supplied with COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS (COMTI). By
default, they are found in the following directory:

   ...\Program Files\SNA\Comti\SampleCode\ProgrammingSpecifics\TCP

There is one additional sample in that directory, Imsimpl.cbl, to which this
article does not apply.

You may modify these samples as necessary and use them if you want when TCP/IP is
the protocol for mainframe connectivity. The programs are capable of writing
status entries, including error information, to a log, but logging is disabled
by default. To enable logging, the sample code must be changed, and the program
recompiled and linkage edited.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For the CICS programs, Cicscs.cbl and Mscmtics.cbl, when logging is enabled,
data is written to the standard IBM Customer Information Control System (CICS)
Transient Data queue named CSMT. The CICS task number is logged in addition to
the status or error information.

For the IMS program, Imsexpl.cbl, when logging is enabled, the status or error
information is written to the Job Entry Subsystem (JES) log of the Information
Management System (IMS) Message Processing Region (MPR) in which the program
executes.

To enable logging, change the source code to initialize the ENABLE-LOGGING
variable to 'Y' instead of 'N'. Find the line

   01 ENABLE-LOGGING PIC X VALUE 'N'

and change it to

   01 ENABLE-LOGGING PIC X VALUE 'Y'

Then compile and link the program.

Note that there may be additional administrative steps necessary on the mainframe
to actually implement the new versions of the programs in either CICS or IMS.
For that, the appropriate mainframe administrative personnel should be
contacted.
