KEYWORDS:kbusage kbdta kbtemplate

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a new template based on your Normal.dot template, the following
attributes are not copied to the new template:

 - All user-defined styles

 - Changes made to default (built-in) styles

 - Text that you typed in Normal.dot

 - Built-in AutoText entries (Attention Line, Closing, Header/Footer, Mailing
   Instructions, Reference Line, Salutation, and Subject Line)

NOTE: This problem does not occur for any other template you may use to base your
new template on.

CAUSE
=====

Because items stored in the Normal template are available from any Word
document, these items are not copied to the new template.

WORKAROUND
==========

To include all style definitions when creating a new template based on Normal,
use any of the following methods.

Method 1: Create a new document based on Normal and save it as a template.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. On the File menu, click New.

2. On the General tab, click Blank Document. Under Create New, click Document,
   and then click OK.

3. On the File menu, click Save As.

4. In the Save As dialog box, change the Save as type to Document Template
   (*.dot), and then click OK.

   NOTE: You may want to change the file name before saving your new template.

Method 2: Use the Organizer.
----------------------------

Copy the styles you want from the Normal template into your new template using
the Organizer. To access the Organizer, click Style on the Format menu.
