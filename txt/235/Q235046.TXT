Page 193: Orphan And Widow Definitions Not Entirely Accurate
------------------------------------------------------------

On page 193 the definition of Widow and Orphan are not entirely accurate. The
Computer Dictionary contains the more accurate definitions below.

Widow: A last line of a paragraph, shorter than a full line, appearing at the top
of a page.

Orphan: The first line of a paragraph printed alone at the bottom of a page or
column of text, or the last line of a paragraph printed alone at the top of a
page or column.

The definition of Orphan can be changed to reflect this additional information.

Change:
"The first line of a paragraph appears on its own at the bottom of a column or
page. Can be corrected by adjusting character, line, or paragraph spacing."

To:
"The first line of a paragraph appears on its own at the bottom of a column or
page, or the last line of a paragraph appears alone at the top of a page or
column. Can be corrected by adjusting character, line, or paragraph spacing."


Last Page: Software Not Included With Book
