TITLE   :SMS: Resource Explorer Doesn't Work As MMC Console Snap-in
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbConfig kbMMC kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbResX kbsmsAdmin kbsmsUtil

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) Resource Explorer doesn't function as
expected when it is added as a snap-in to a custom MMC Console. In the
Add/Remove Snap-In option box on the Console menu in a custom MMC console, you
can see two choices listed for SMS:

 - SMS Administrator Console

 - SMS Resource Explorer

If you select the SMS Resource Explorer and add it to the MMC, and then select
that SMS Resource Explorer node, you receive a "Connection Failed" message in
the console.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Do not add the SMS Resource Explorer as a snap-in on a custom console, because
it is dependent upon the SMS Administrator Console to function.

If the snap-in is thereafter removed from MMC 1.1, you receive a series of error
messages similar to the following:

   _com_error exception in MMC Admin UI!
   COM Error : Invalid pointer
   Source :
   Description :

   Entry Point : CComponentDataImp::tm_SetDefaultVerb
   Operation :
   Command Line: "D:\WINNT\System32\mmc.exe"
   Trace :

This error message is not displayed when you use MMC 1.2. The snap-in is
gracefully removed.
