SYMPTOMS
========

When you advertise a package to upgrade a client from Microsoft Windows 95 to
Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition (SE) by using the W95to98.inf file, you may
receive the following error message during the upgrade process:

   The file 'Driver21.cab' on 11 cannot be
   found.

   Setup could not find a file on the specified
   path. If the path appears below, make sure it
   is correct. Click OK to try copying again.

You can click any of the available buttons (OK, Skip File, Browse, or Cancel),
but the upgrade is not completed successfully.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Driver21.cab file is not included in Windows 98
SE.

WORKAROUND
==========

Copy the Driver21.cab file from the original version of Windows 98 to the
Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) package source directory. The upgrade
can now be completed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
