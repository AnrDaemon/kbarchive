MORE INFORMATION
================

LOC Page: Name And Address Of Online Press Have Changed
-------------------------------------------------------

Online Press has merged with another company and now has a new name and address.
Please replace the text in green on the LOC page with the following text:

"A Quick Course Education/Training Edition for this title is published by Online
Training Solutions, Inc. (OTSI). For information about supplementary workbooks,
contact OTSI at 15422 Bel-Red Road, Redmond, WA 98052, USA. 1-800-854-3344.
E-mail: quickcourse@otsiweb.com."


Pages 12 & 13: My Computer Window Incorrect
-------------------------------------------

The three graphics that depict the My Computer window may not match your computer
screen.


Page 38: Step 1 Is Incorrect
----------------------------

On page 38, step 1 should read as follows:

"Here you type what you want to search for, and you specify the database, or
search provider, you want to use by selecting it from a drop-down list. Clicking
Go initiates the search. (Don't worry if your screen looks different. The site
may have changed, but it should still work essentially the same way.)"


Page 47: Graphic And Procedure Have Changed
-------------------------------------------

This Web site has changed so the graphics on this page will not match what you
see on your computer screen. Therefore, the procedure needs to be modified as
follows:

   2. Click Senate Homepage under Legislative Branch to display the Senate Web
   site...

   3. Find the Senators hyperlink and click it to display a list of hyperlinks to
   Senator information.

   4. In the Directory of Senators, click the name of one of your US Senators...


Page 48: Graphic And Procedure Have Changed
-------------------------------------------

This Web site has changed so the graphic on this page is no longer correct.
Therefore, the sentence in parentheses following the graphic is also incorrect.

Step 2 should be reworded as follows:

"Scroll through the Thomas home page to get an idea of the information you can
access here, and then explore the Bills category, and check out the details of
one specific bill."


Page 51: Organize Favorites Dialog Box Needs More Links
-------------------------------------------------------

Internet Explorer 5 contains more links than are pictured here.


Page 67: No Junk Mail Folder In Outlook Express
-----------------------------------------------

There is no Junk Mail folder in the Inbox in Outlook Express.


Page 73: Procedure And Graphics Are Incorrect
---------------------------------------------

Change the last sentence in step 2 to read:

"If you are not automatically connected to an e-mail server on your
organization's network, you may see this dialog box:"

Change step 3 to read:

"Click the Work Offline button. Then click the Close button to close the
error-reporting dialog box."

The last graphic on the page will not match your screen, as it will not have the
Junk Mail folder in the Inbox.


Pages 76, 86, 91, 97, 101, 104, 117: Junk Mail Folder Not In Inbox
------------------------------------------------------------------

The Inbox in Outlook Express does not contain a folder for Junk Mail.


Page 107: Graphic Will Not Match Computer Screen
------------------------------------------------

The graphic on page 107 will not match your computer screen.


Page 121: Name Of Directory Server Is Incorrect
-----------------------------------------------

In the second graphic on this page, the information in the directory server text
box should say:

"uls.microsoft.com"


Pages 144-146: Procedures Are Incorrect
---------------------------------------

The procedure that begins on page 144 and continues to page 145 is incorrect.

On page 144 change step 2 to read: "Click the View button at the top of the
Explorer bar..."

On page 145, in step 3, italicize the word "Inter-Links" in the second sentence
only.

The graphic appearing in the procedure beginning on page 145 and continuing on
page 146 is also incorrect.

The sentence after the graphic on page 145 should read: " ...and has moved the
Standard toolbar into the space formerly occupied by the title bar at the top of
the screen." This sentence should be followed by a new step 2 that reads: "2.
Right-click the toolbar and choose Menu Bar from the shortcut menu."

On page 146, re-number steps 2 and 3 to be 3 and 4.

In the new step 3, on page 146, change the text to read: "Right-click the toolbar
again and choose Address Bar..."


Page 113: Step 3 Is Incomplete
------------------------------

Please add the following sentence at the end of step 3:

"(You may have to choose this command twice.)"
