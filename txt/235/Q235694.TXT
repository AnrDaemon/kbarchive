PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP2; winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMSMQ kbMSMQ100 kbMSMQ100fix kbMQSeries _IK kbMQSeriesBridge

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Message Queue Server (MSMQ) version 1.0 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ) application using the MSMQEP API specifies
the ReplyToQMgr property and the ReplyToQ property, the MSMQ-MQSeries Bridge
would overwrite the ReplyToQMgr value with the MSMQ-MQSeries Bridge Computer
Name, that is, the MSMQ Queue Manager name.

CAUSE
=====

The MSMQ-MQSeries Bridge was incorrectly overwriting the value for ReplyToQMgr
when the ReplyToQ was specified. The MSMQ-MQSeries Bridge has been changed to
only replace the ReplyToQMgr property with MSMQ-MQSeries Bridge Computer Name,
if it is empty and if the ReplyToQ property is specified.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for SNA Server
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
