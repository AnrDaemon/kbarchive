======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 to compile
a script with the Edit INI File action included in it, the action might fail if
the script is run on a Microsoft Windows 95 or a Microsoft Windows 98 system.

This will occur if the script was compiled using the Microsoft SMS Installer 32
and it was compiled only for 32-bit clients. The option to compile only for
32-bit clients is selected under installation properties\destination platforms
in the script editor. Select both 16-bit and 32-bit under installation
properties\destination platforms in the script editor before compiling the
executable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S.
service pack for Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0. For
