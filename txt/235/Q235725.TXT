======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Service Pack 1 of Systems Management Server 2.0 Installer has an additional
Sleep script item that can be used to pause the installation program for a
specified length of time.

Use the Sleep action to temporarily halt the setup program. You can temporarily
halt the Setup program to allow time for other processes to end before
proceeding. For example, you should temporarily halt the Setup program if an
external executable file that is being called from the Setup program calls
another executable file, then returns without waiting for the second executable
process to end.

NOTE: The time that the Setup program will pause is in milliseconds. For example,
enter 2000 milliseconds to temporarily halt the Setup program for two seconds.
Do not use a comma or other non-numeric characters.

STATUS
------

MORE INFORMATION

Installer 2.0.80.00 and higher.
