TITLE   :SMS: Control Panel Tool Shows Previous Version After Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbClient kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsUtil kbSoftwareDist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Systems Management tool in Control Panel to view client
component version information after a site upgrade, the old version information
is displayed even though the components have been successfully upgraded.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) starts the upgrade process
and directly updates the following client components:

 - SMS Client Base components

 - Available Program Manager WIN32

 - Windows Management

Client components that CCIM updates immediately show updated version information.
CCIM then passes the upgrade of the remaining client components to the Available
Programs Manager (APM). APM upgrades those components on a schedule. CCIM does
not know when APM will upgrade those components, so it does not update the
version information. Within one hour, CCIM restarts, checks version information,
and displays current version information in the System Management Control Panel
tool.
