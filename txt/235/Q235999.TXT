TITLE   :Savedump Does Not Write Event Log Message with Event ID 1000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When there is not enough free disk space to write a dump file, Savedump.exe does
not write the following entry to the event log:

   Event ID: 1000
   Source: Save Dump
   Description:
   The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.
   The bugcheck was: 0xdeaddead (0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000,
   0x00000000).
   Microsoft Windows NT [v15.1381].
   A full dump was not saved.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because remote procedure call (RPC) returns an
unanticipated error message when Savedump.exe attempts to get a handle to the
registry (RegisterEventSource).

RPC returns RPC_S_UNKNOWN_IF (The interface is unknown. Error code 1717), but
Savedump.exe checks only for a return code of RPC_S_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE (The RPC
server is unavailable. Error code 1722). The return error code 1717 is ignored.
