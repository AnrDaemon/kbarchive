PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing the Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0 client
on a Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 3.51-based client, Web Based Enterprise
Management (WBEM) may not be installed. This behavior is likely to be
intermittent. When this occurs, the Ccim32.log file contains the following error
messages:

   Waiting for Process "i386\WBEMSDK /s" to finish...
   *** Process "i386\WBEMSDK /s" finished; exit code = 128.
   *** ERROR - base component "Windows Management" install state set to ""

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs intermittently because of a problem in the Wbemupgrade.dll
file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, do not cancel the client installation. The client
should recover from this error automatically. After several attempts, WBEM
should be installed successfully.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
