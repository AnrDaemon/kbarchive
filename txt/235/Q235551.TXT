======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When you type "exit" (without the quotation marks) from a full-screen DOS window
in an ICA session to a Terminal Server computer, the ICA session stops
responding (hangs). This behavior occurs after you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 4 (SP4) to the Terminal Server computer.

CAUSE

This problem occurs because a change in the console window handler in SP4 did
not handle the switch from text to graphics mode properly.


RESOLUTION
==========

4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Pack 4, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT
