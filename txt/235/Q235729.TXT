SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server 2.0 has the capability to do silent/unattended
upgrades of Systems Management Server Service Packs.

To install Service Pack 1 silently, you can run "Setup.exe /Upgrade /NoUserInput"
from the \SMSSetup\Bin\%platform% directory on the Systems Management Server SP1
CD.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: If you use the /NOUSERINPUT switch, the user won't be presented with any
dialog boxes. If the Systems Management Server Administrator Console is open on
the server, the upgrade process will close it for you.

If you do NOT use the /NOUSERINPUT switch and just use /Upgrade, the user will be
prompted to close down any administrator consoles if open, and the dialog box
indicating that Systems Management Server Setup has finished will be displayed.

STATUS
