-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you insert a Microsoft Excel Chart object into a Word 97 document and
group it with an object such as a text box, the following error messages appear
when you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro that uses the DoVerb method
to open the Excel chart:

   Word cannot edit the Microsoft Excel Chart

   Run-time error "16389" Internal Error

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the Open method instead of the DoVerb method to open the Excel object. For
example, change the following code:

   ActiveDocument.Shapes(1).GroupItems(1).OleFormat.DoVerb 2

to

   ActiveDocument.Shapes(1).GroupItems(1).OleFormat.Open

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
