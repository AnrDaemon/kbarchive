The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0

SUMMARY
=======

When an application adds REG_MULTI_SZ values to the registry that has been
repackaged with the Systems Management Server Installer, the executable that is
generated by Systems Management Server Installer fails to recreate these
registry entries correctly. This can cause errors when attempting to use the
repackaged application at a later time. REG_MULTI_SZ values are normally
terminated by two consecutive nulls. Systems Management Server Installer fails
to insert the second null which normally indicates the end of a REG_MULTI_SZ
value.

For more information on the various value types in the registry see the following
article:

   Q101230 Definition of Registry Value Data Types.

STATUS

Systems Management Installer version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the
