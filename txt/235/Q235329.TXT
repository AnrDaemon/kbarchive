To change a group of MS Mail custom recipients to SMTP custom recipients:

1. Export the MS Mail custom recipients to a .csv file that contains all of the
   pertinent headers. You can find a copy of a .csv file that is designed to
   export custom recipients on the Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 CD in
   the Support\Samples\Csvs\Custom\Custom.csv folder.

2. Use Microsoft Excel to open the .csv file that you created in step 1.

3. Select the entire file, and sort it by the E-mail Address header.

4. If you only want to change a subset of these custom recipients, delete all of
   the rows except the rows that you want from this file.

5. Delete the E-mail Addresses column.

6. Under the E-mail Address column, delete all of the existing e-mail addresses.
   The addresses are in the following MS Mail format:

   MS:<network>/<postoffice>/<user>

7. Type the primary SMTP addresses in the E-mail Address column in the following
   format:

   SMTP:<alias>@<domain>.com

8. Delete the Imported-From, Obj-Container, and Obj-Dist-Name columns, if they
   exist.

9. Save this .csv file to a different name.

10. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program and on the Tools menu, click
   Directory Import to import the .csv file that you saved in step 9 to the
   target Recipients container.

If you do not have the Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 CD, the sample .csv
files are available in a file that you can download. The following file is
available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:
