======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When files are copied to a Macintosh volume, the changes do not appear on a
Macintosh client immediately. For the files to appear on the Macintosh client
directory, you must wait approximately five seconds, and then refresh the
Macintosh Finder. If a file is copied to a Macintosh volume on a Windows NT 4.0
server and is then immediately renamed, Services for Macintosh (SFM) does not
update the index and the Macintosh client cannot see the files until the index
is rebuilt.

NOTE: The SFM volume index is automatically rebuilt when SFM is started or
restarted with Windows NT 4.0 SP4 or later. For additional information and
troubleshooting information about SFM and volume indexing, please click the

CAUSE
=====

SFM does not update the volume indices if files are renamed immediately after
being written to the volume.
