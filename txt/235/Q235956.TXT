SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 introduces two new linker optimization options --
/OPT:WIN98, which is set by default, and /OPT:NOWIN98. The default sets the file
alignment at 4K instead of the previous 512 bytes. This results in a larger
module size, but one which loads faster on Windows 98 with reduced file
swapping. A release build of an AppWizard-generated MDI application is
approximately 14K larger than when the /OPT:NOWIN98 option is used, and a
ReleaseMinSize build of a standard ATL DLL with no objects added is
approximately 17K larger.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default WIN98 optimization for file alignment places the base of sections in
the portable executable image on Windows 98's page boundary, resulting in
decreased load times and reduced need for file swapping. The percentage increase
in module size is less for larger applications, and the benefits normally
justify the increase in size. However, if module size is a critical factor,
/OPT:NOWIN98 can be used to revert to the original 512-byte alignment.

NOTE: The /ALIGN:512 option also has this effect, but will produce linker warning
4108, as this option is normally reserved for drivers.

The Visual C++ ReadMe file (READMEVC.htm) has further information on these linker
options.
