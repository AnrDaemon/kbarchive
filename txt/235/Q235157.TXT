TITLE   :SMS: When New DP Added, Despooler Puts Package on Old & New DP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a new distribution server to the site hierarchy, the Despooler
service refreshes both the current and new distribution points. When the server
distributes software, this behavior causes packages to be placed, or refreshed,
on both servers.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The software distribution feature allows an administrator to distribute
applications, or single files as packages to distribution servers in a Systems
Management Server hierarchy. After a package is distributed, the administrator
can send a job to install the application, or to run a command on the client
computer by using files in the package.

When a package is received at a site, the Despooler places the package on
distribution servers. The administrator can configure the distribute phase to
overwrite the package on current distribution servers or to place it on a new
group of distribution servers. A list displays the server groups defined by the
administrator, and a group called Default Servers.

The Despooler service keeps a list of the master (stored) packages on the site
server, and a list of distribution servers on which a package is stored. These
lists are stored in Transfer Packages for distribution servers, or in Microsoft
Windows NT in the following registry key:

   SMS\Components\SMS_Despooler\Master Packages
