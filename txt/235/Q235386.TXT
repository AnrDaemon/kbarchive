KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp600 kbOSWinCEsearch kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Beep statement is not available in eVB/VBCE applications. However, the Beep
functionality can be implemented using the MessageBeep API call.

MORE INFORMATION
================

VBCE 6.0 includes the capability to declare and use certain system application
programming interfaces (APIs). The file WINCEAPI.TXT is provided with the VBCE
Toolkit and includes sample declare statements, constants, and other useful
information.

The following code demonstrates this sample:

1. Create a new Windows CE project in either Visual Basic or eMbedded Visual
   Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place a Command Button on Form1.

3. Paste the following code into the code module of Form1:

   Option Explicit
      Declare Function MessageBeep Lib "Coredll" (ByVal wType As Long) As Long
      Const MB_ICONHAND = 16
      Const MB_ICONQUESTION = 32
      Const MB_ICONEXCLAMATION = 48
      Const MB_ICONASTERISK = 64
      Const MB_ICONINFORMATION = 64   'MB_ICONASTERISK
      Const MB_ICONSTOP = 16 	        'MB_ICONHAND

      Private Sub Command1_Click()
         Dim ret
         ret = MessageBeep(MB_ICONEXCLAMATION)
         If ret = 0 Then Msgbox "Error occurred"
      End Sub
