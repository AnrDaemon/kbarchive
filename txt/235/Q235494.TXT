TITLE   :XFOR: Certain Exchange Recipients Don't Display Properly in GW
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Novell GroupWise user receives a message sent by means of the Microsoft
Connector for Novell GroupWise, certain Microsoft Exchange Server recipients may
not be displayed correctly in the GroupWise client. This occurs for Exchange
Server users who have the parenthesis character (())in their display name, for
example:

   John Smith (Exchange)

Only the word "Exchange" is displayed representing the user. This does not affect
the ability to reply to mail between GroupWise and Exchange Server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by the way the GroupWise client displays message header
information.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the display name of Exchange Server users or other custom recipients such
that their display names do not contain the parenthesis characters; for example,
use a square bracket ([]) instead.
