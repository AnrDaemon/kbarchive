TITLE   :SMS: Programs Fail to Run From a Package Subdirectory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft's Systems Management Server version 2.0 offers an administrator the
option of browsing to the location where the source files are when creating
packages.

When an administrator uses the browse button and traverses the directory
structure to the source file, a bad source path will be created if any of the
directory names contain at least two words with a space between them. Normally,
an administrator would surround the directory name with double quotes in order
to let the Operating System know that this is the name of a single directory.

An example of this might be:

x:\WINNT\Software\Source Files

The directory SOURCE FILES would cause a problem if the Administrator did not
catch this and add double quotes around the directory name. Once the
Administrator caught the omission, the path would appear like the following:

x:\WINNT\Software\"Source Files"

When the Administrator confirms the source path in the Admin Console, it would be
correct on appearance based on what the Windows Explorer might display. The
system would not automatically surround the directory name with double quotes.
When the instruction file is called to execute the package an Advertisement and
the source path run, this would generate a failure since the path in the
Instruction file would be incorrect.

This issue is more likely to arise in an environment running Windows 2000 since
the number of paths with spaces is dramatically increased from that of Windows
NT Server 4.0.

STATUS

version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
