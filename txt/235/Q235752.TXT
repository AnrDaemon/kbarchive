SYMPTOMS
========

When running prompted queries in Systems Management Server 2.0, the results may
show up as blank records with an Icon at the left of each row. If you attempt to

query code from Access using the ODBC / WBEM interface produces blank rows as

   SELECT ..... FROM SMS_G_System_SoftwareFiles as swfile INNER JOIN SMS_R_SYSTEM as sys ON swfile.ResourceID = sys.ResourceID Where ...

The following change in the WQL code allows the query to run properly:

   SELECT ..... FROM SMS_R_SYSTEM as sys INNER JOIN SMS_G_System_SoftwareFiles as swfile ON swfile.ResourceID = sys.ResourceID Where
