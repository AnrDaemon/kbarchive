TITLE   :XFOR:Stopping Connectivity Controller Doesn't Stop GWRouter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When you stop the Microsoft Exchange Connectivity Controller (connector)
service, it also stops the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise
(GroupWise connector) service. However, it does not stop the Microsoft Exchange
Router for Novell GroupWise (GWRouter) service. Stopping the GWRouter service
stops the GroupWise connector service, but not the controller service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is different from previous connectors such as the Lotus
Notes/SNADS/OVVM(PROFS) connectors, where stopping the controller service shuts
down all related services.

Additional query words: router
