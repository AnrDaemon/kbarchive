TITLE   :SMS: Specifying \\servername Send Address May Cause Failure
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you specify a servername prefixed by "\\", and the sender tries to connect to
the computer using \\\\servername, the connection may fail. Specify the server
name without the two backslashes in front for the Sender address box.

CAUSE
=====

Sender prepends "\\" to the server name specified in the Sender address. The
sender log displays the following information:

      Created sending thread (Thread ID = 205)
      Trying the No. 1 address (out of 1)
      Error during WNetAddConnection2 to \\\\DSSMS\SMS_SITE (67).
      No (more) send requests found to process.
      There is no existing connection, Win32 error = 0
      Operation is retryable.

      Cannot connect to server \\DSSMS at remote site MS1, won't try send    
      requests going to site MS1 for an hour or until there are no active      
      send requests. 

      Could not establish connection.
      Attempt to connect failed.
      There is no existing connection, Win32 error = 0
      No need to disconnect
      Restart time = 03/17/99 10:47:16 Eastern Standard Time

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

This has been fixed in Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 1. Even if
\\servername is specified in the Sender address box, Lan Sender parses the name
correctly.
