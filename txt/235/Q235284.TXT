TITLE   :MPPE Keys Not Handled Correctly for a 128-Bit MS-CHAP Request
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) keys may not be encrypted correctly
for a 128-bit Microsoft Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (MS-CHAP)
request. The Microsoft Internet Authentication service (IAS) Remote
Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server and Routing and Remote
Access Services (RRAS) correctly decrypt the MPPE keys, but do not correctly
encrypt them.

This problem occurs if a user either dials into a third-party network access
server (such as Cisco, Ascend, and so on) and uses 128-bit MS-CHAP on the
Windows NT 4.0 RADIUS server, or dials into a Windows NT 4.0 RRAS server that is
configured to be authenticated on a Microsoft Windows 2000 server.

RESOLUTION
==========
