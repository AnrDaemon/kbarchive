======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you compile a Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) Installer script on
a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 or Microsoft Windows 2000-based computer, the %sys%
variable may report different values when run on Win16-based systems than when
run on Win32-based systems.

For example, when you select "32-bit Windows (32-bit EXE)" as the destination
platform under the Advanced Configuration settings, the %sys% variable is set to
%systemroot%\system32. However, when the same script is compiled with the
destination platform set to "16/32-bit Windows (16-bit EXE)", the variable is
set to %systemroot%\system.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design and is the default behavior of the
GetSystemDirectory() function.
