TITLE   :XFOR: Warning Event ID 31043 Logged by GroupWise Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following message may be logged in the application event log by the
Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise:

   Event ID: 31043
   Source: MSExchangeGWISE
   Type: Information
   Category: Transport to Exchange
   Description: Warning

   Message trace information inconsistent or missing.

CAUSE
=====

This event is logged because the Private Management Domain (PRMD) field for the
X.400 site proxy is empty. The empty PRMD field is a requirement for Microsoft
Exchange Server Defense Messaging System (DMS). The event is harmless and is
simply an indication that the trace Global Domain Identifier (GDI) information
was generated differently than a typical piece of mail.

RESOLUTION
==========

This event is only generated if Transport to Exchange logging on the Microsoft
Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise is set to Medium or higher. Set
Transport to Exchange logging lower than Medium so that the connector does not
log this event.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
