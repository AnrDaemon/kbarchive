SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the CMonthCalCtrl::GetCurSel(CTime) to get the date selected from
the Month Calendar Common control, the date in the CTime class is incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

MFC's implementation of CMonthCalCtrl::GetCurSel() for the CTime class calls
SendMessage(MCM_GETCURSEL, &sysTime) where sysTime is a SYSTEMTIME
structure. The MCM_GETCURSEL message does not fill in the hours, minutes, and
seconds part of the sysTime Structure with valid values. However, the
constructor for CTime class takes these values into consideration, so the date
in CTime class is incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is to use the CMonthCalCtrl::GetCurSel(SYSTEMTIME*) version of
GetCurSel for this class to get the correct date. The code will look like the
following example:

      SYSTEMTIME sysTime;

      m_MonthCal.GetCurSel(&sysTime);

      sysTime.wHour = sysTime.wMinute = sysTime.wSecond =    sysTime.wMilliseconds = 0;
     
      CTime l_time(sysTime);

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
