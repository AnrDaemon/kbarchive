SYMPTOMS
========

When Novell GroupWise clients send a zero-length attachment in a message by
means of the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise, the message
never arrives in Exchange Server. The API gateway reports the following error
message while processing the outbound message:

   Error processing message attachments.

In addition, a non-delivery-report (NDR) is not be generated back to the
GroupWise user, so the message appears to have mysteriously disappeared.

CAUSE
=====

The API gateway does not support zero-length attachments in a message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange connector for
Novell GroupWise due to its dependency on the API gateway.
