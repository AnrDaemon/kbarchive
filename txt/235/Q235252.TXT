PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you upgrade to Outlook 2000 from a previous version of Outlook that uses
Microsoft Schedule+ as the primary calendar, you may be unable to configure
calendar permissions for delegates after you disable the use of Schedule+ as the
primary calendar.

When you click Options on the Tools menu, click Delegates, and then try to set up
calendar permissions, the permission list is unavailable, which prevents you
from establishing calendar permissions for delegates.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because if you upgrade to Outlook 2000 and continue to
use Schedule+ as your primary calendar, and then convert to use the Outlook
calendar as your primary calendar, the UseSchedPlus registry value is changed
from 1 to 0 in the Office 9.0 key, but the corresponding Office 8.0 entry is not
changed from 1 to 0.

Outlook 2000 disables the Schedule+ option in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\9.0\Outlook\SchedPlusOption

   "UseSchedPlus"=dword:00000000

However, the following registry key remains enabled:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Outlook\SchedPlusOption

   "UseSchedPlus"=dword:00000001

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the following Office 8.0 registry key to disable the SchedPlusOption
value by changing it to 0:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Outlook\SchedPlusOption

   "UseSchedPlus"=dword:00000000

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook 2000.
