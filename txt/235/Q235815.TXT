SUMMARY
=======

When you resend advertisements to clients, the current time is not automatically
updated. To resend an assigned (mandatory) advertised program, you must first
update the time in the advertisement's properties. When the time has been
updated, the advertisement is automatically resent. To update the time and
resend the advertisement, follow these steps:

1. In the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator Console,
   navigate to the Advertisements folder, right-click the advertisement that you
   want to resend, and then click Properties.

2. In the Advertisement Properties dialog box, click the Schedule tab.

3. On the Schedule tab, in the Mandatory Assignments section, click the asterisk
   (*) to create a new assignment.

4. Click OK again.

For the resend operation to be successful, a new assignment must be created. The
existing assignment should not be edited. Also, the assignment must have a full
schedule, not configured to occur after an event (As soon as possible, Logon,
Logoff).
