SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message, the following error message may be displayed:

   The message interface has returned an unknown error. If the problem persists,
   restart Outlook.

CAUSE
=====

The message that you tried to send is addressed to a user or personal
distribution list that does not reside in your personal address book or does not
reside in the global address list.

This may happen if you log on to a mailbox and try to send a message that was
previously addressed by using a personal address book for that mailbox.

RESOLUTION
==========

The user who created the original message must send that message from the
computer where the personal address book that contains the personal distribution
list is stored.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you try to save the personal distribution list that is listed in the To field
to your personal address book by clicking "Add to personal address book", the
following error message is displayed:

   Cannot perform the requested operation. The command selected is not valid for
   this recipient.
