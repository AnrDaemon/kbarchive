======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, versions 3.5, 3.51, 3.6, 3.7 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.0, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

ODBC drivers that return keywords outside the range of Absolute to Zone cause an
access violation in the Microsoft OLEDB Provider for ODBC (MSDASQL) that ships
with Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.0 and 2.1 when the
IDBInfo::GetKeywords() method is called.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because of a code problem in the binary search algorithm used by
MSDASQL.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, modify the driver so that it does not return
keywords outside the range Absolute - Zone.

For example, if the driver returns the keyword Abort, the Microsoft OLEDB
Provider for ODBC (MSDASQL) gets an access violation.

STATUS
======

This has been fixed as of MDAC 2.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can find the default list of Reserved Keywords in the ODBC Programmer's
Reference, Volume 2. The default keywords range from ABSOLUTE to ZONE.
