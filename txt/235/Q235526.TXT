TITLE   :Event ID 295 Error Message Importing Foreign Language Templates
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you import a foreign language template to an Exchange Server computer, the
following error message may be displayed:

   <number> error descriptions were recorded in the system's application
   event log.

   The file <dir>:\Template.err contains copies of all object descriptions
   containing errors.

In the Windows NT Event Viewer application event log, events of the following
type may be logged:

   Event ID: 295
   Source: MSExchangeDSImp
   Type: Error
   Category: None
   Description: Unable to open or read the attribute value include file
   <filename>.blt OR <filename>.scr

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you import the foreign language template file (the
Template.csv file) from a directory or file location that does not contain the
other files (the .blt and .scr files) that the Template.csv file references.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform a directory import from the
Server\Setup\<platform>\Tpl\<language> directory on the Exchange
Server CD for that language. In addition to the Template.csv file, this
directory contains all the .blt and .scr files that the foreign language
templates need to create localized addressing, details templates and addressing,
and one-off address templates for that language.

You can also copy the Template.csv file and all of the .blt and .scr files from
the Exchange Server CD to a directory that you can perform the import to the
Exchange Server computer from.
