TITLE   :SMS: Unable to View Status Messages Because of Message Aging
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbConfig kbDatabase kbMMC kbServer kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbQuery kbReport kbsmsAdmin kbS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may be unable to view status messages as expected for a Microsoft Systems
Management Server (SMS) component.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the default status filter rules keep Audit
messages for 180 days and all other messages for 30 days. The status viewer may
fail when a status query returns too many messages, thereby filling up the
Microsoft SQL Server tempdb database.

Online Help may indicate that the default Status Filter Rules setting advises
that messages will be kept for only seven days. This default applies to new
rules only and not to existing or default Status Filter rules.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, follow these steps:

1. Use the SMS Administrator console to open the Site Settings folder for your
   site.

2. Expand the Status Filter Rules folder.

3. Right-click the "Write all other messages to the site database and keep them
   for 30 days" rule, and then click Properties.

   On the Actions tab, note that "Keep messages for" is set to 30 days.

4. Set this number to something smaller, and then click OK.

5. Right-click the "Write audit messages to the site database and keep them for
   180 days" rule, and then click Properties.

   On the Actions tab, note that "Keep messages for" is set to 180 days.

6. Set this number to something smaller, and then click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
