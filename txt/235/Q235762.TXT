KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbServer kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbMaintMan

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During each maintenance cycle of Systems Management Server 2.0, the Windows NT
Logon Server Manager component attempts to enumerate all of the shares on
Windows NT domain controllers. This can consume available network bandwidth on
slow links if any of these shares are not available.

An example would be servers that have empty but shared CD-ROM drives or
jukeboxes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
