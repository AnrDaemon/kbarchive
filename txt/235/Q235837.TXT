TITLE   :SMS: LAN_SENDER Doesn't Fail Job When No Instruction File Exists
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbServer kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbPackage kbScheduler kbSoftwareDist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the SMS_LAN_SENDER component receives a send request from the Scheduler, it
does not determine whether there is a valid instruction file in the
\Schedule.box\Tosend directory before trying to send the package file. After
sending the package file, SMS_LAN_SENDER tries sending the instruction file. If
the file does not exist, it simply reschedules the send request to try again
later.

This can result in a situation where the package file keeps being re-sent to the
destination site without a corresponding instruction file, and a zero byte file
is created on the destination site. If the package were a large one, this could
quickly consume the drive space on a remote site.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, you can manually delete the zero byte files from
the Despoolr.box\Receive directory on the central site.

STATUS
======
