TITLE   :SMS: Command Fails When Running an Advertisement Using %windir%
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbClient kbConfig kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbAdvertisement kbPackage kbSoftwareDist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a command line or batch file that uses the %windir% variable, the
command may fail or the resulting output file content may be empty or incorrect.
This often occurs with packages that have been migrated from Systems Management
Server 1.2 to version 2.0.


WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this behavior, replace the %windir% variable with the %systemroot%
variable. Keep in mind that the %systemroot% variable may not exist on Windows
95 and Windows 98 machines.

Another method to work around this issue is to start the application using a
batch file that first executes SET WINDIR=%SYSTEMROOT%. Some applications
specifically look for WINDIR and can't easily be changed to look for SYSTEMROOT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
