TITLE   :Invoking COMTI Method Elicits MTS Event ID 4128
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, versions 1.0, 4.0 SP2 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After successfully implementing a Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS
and IMS (COMTI) application using SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1), this
release of SNA Server is uninstalled and SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) is
installed.

Afterwards, COMTI methods fail with the following entry appearing in the
application Event Log:

   Event ID: 4128
   Source: Transaction Server
   Type: Error
   Category: Class Factory Wrapper

   The run-time environment was unable to load an application component due to
   either an error obtaining its properties from the catalog, loading the DLL or
   getting the procedure address of DllGetClassObject. This error caused the
   process to terminate.
   C:\SNA\COMTI\Tagen.dll (Package: OneMoreTime) (Microsoft Transaction Server
   Internals Information: File: d:\viper\src\runtime\cfw\ccomdll.cpp, Line: 151)

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem is related to the fact that SNA Server 4.0 SP2 is installed in a
different directory, by default, than SNA Server 4.0 SP1, C:\Program Files\SNA,
and C:\SNA, respectively. Those who use the defaults and have chosen to
reinstall SNA Server instead of to upgrade SNA Server may incur this problem.

There are at least two workarounds:

 - Install SNA Server 4.0 SP2 using the same directory structure that SNA Server
   4.0 SP1 was installed in.

 - Uninstall the COMTI application component libraries from their MTS packages,
   and then reinstall them.
