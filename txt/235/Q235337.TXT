TITLE   :Cannot Remove Internet Explorer 5 After You Uninstall Service Pa
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbinterop kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 uninstall feature on
a computer running Windows NT that has already had Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4
uninstalled (reverting back to Service Pack 3), the uninstall process stops and
the following error message may be displayed:

   Unable to locate Regsvr32.exe

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Update.inf file for Service Pack 4 was
configured to remove Regsvr32.exe (as are all other files installed by the
service pack Update process) during an uninstallation of the service pack.
However, the Internet Explorer 5 uninstall feature requires the Regsvr32.exe
file to be present to properly complete the uninstall process.

NOTE: If the Regsvr32.exe file already exists on the computer before the Service
Pack 4 installation, uninstalling the service pack restores the previous version
of Regsvr32.exe and the uninstall process can then be completed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, complete the uninstall process for Internet Explorer
5.0 before uninstalling Service Pack 4.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.
