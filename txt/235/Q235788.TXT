KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When distributing packages to child primary or secondary sites the Distribution
Manager may not process the *.pkg file in the \SMS\Inboxes\DistMgr.box\Incoming
directory. Distribution Manager will be running and logging but it appears that
it does not detect this incoming package.

This causes the package not to arrive at any of the Distribution Points for this
particular site. Do not update the same package on distribution points in a
close time frame. Allow time for each update to complete before updating the
distribution points again.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by the Distribution Manager and Despooler attempting to update
the package source files at the same time using different version numbers. This
usually occurs when Distribution Manager receives a package update while it is
decompressing the source files for the same package.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
