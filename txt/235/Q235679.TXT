TITLE   :XADM: Slow Performance Opening Unread Item from Public Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

All users attempting to open any unread message item in a particular public
folder experience a long delay before the message is opened.

CAUSE
=====

The public folder has many server-side restriction tables (views) associated
with it. Whenever a change is made to a message in a folder, or a new message
created or deleted, the message must be evaluated against all the server-side
restrictions so that they can be updated. Opening an unread message changes the
state of the MSGFLAG_READ bit of the PR_MESSAGE_FLAGS MAPI property. Normally,
each restriction is represented by a table in the database, and this table must
be opened to be updated/evaluated. It is possible, however, for the information
store to avoid opening the table if the client operation is simply changing the
read/unread state of a message, because the server can tell (without opening the
table) if the restriction involves the MSGFLAG_READ bit.


RESOLUTION
==========

Code was added to the information store to check if the restriction involves the
read/unread message flags and if not, it can avoid opening the restriction table
(which improves performance).

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
