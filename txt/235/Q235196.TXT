The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure Software Distribution, it is possible to set configuration
combinations for Advertisements and Packages in the Microsoft Systems Management
Server Administrator Console, resulting in the failure of Software Distribution
to clients.

The following settings cause a conflict, and as a result, the client does not run
the advertisement as expected:

 - Package: The program environment "Program can run" setting is configured to
   "Only when a user is logged on".

 - Advertisement: The advertisement schedule has a mandatory assignment, with
   the "Assign immediately after this event" item configured for logoff.

- or -

 - The program is set to run "Only when no user is logged on".

 - The advertisement is set to Run at logon.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
