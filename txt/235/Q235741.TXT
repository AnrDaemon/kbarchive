KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the executable compiled by the 16-bit version of System Management
Server Installer the following error may appear if the CTL3DV2.DLL file does not
exist on the target Windows NT Workstation:

   CTL3DV2.DLL has not been correctly installed...installation could not
   continue.

This file is only needed on 16-bit clients when the Use Internal 3D Effects box
is checked in Installation properties of the program. The program was compiled
on a 16-bit operating system which requires a CTL3DV2.DLL to run 3-D effects. A
32-bit operating systems uses the CTL3D32.DLL.

If you are going to run the program on a 32-bit operating system, compile the
program on a 32-bit operating system rather than on a 16-bit operating system.

STATUS
======

version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
