TITLE   :XWEB: MAPI Message Property PR_PRIORITY Is Not Created with CDO
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you send a message using Outlook Web Access (OWA), the MAPI field property
PR_PRIORITY is not created. The message transfer agent (MTA) uses this field to
elevate message priority. Without this field, the message is processed with
normal priority through the MTA.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Outlook 97 and Outlook 98, the PR_PRIORTY field is created when the user sets
the PR_IMPORTANCE by means of the user interface (UI). The PR_PRIORTY field is
not created in OWA because Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) do not support the
creation of the PR_PRIORITY field as a result of setting the PR_IMPORTANCE. The
following table shows the different states for the PR_IMPORTANCE and PR_PRIORITY
fields.

+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Client     | Outlook/OWA   | Outlook     | OWA         |
