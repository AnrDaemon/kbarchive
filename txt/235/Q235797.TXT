TITLE   :SMS: Client Logon Scripts Do Not Function over a RAS Link
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbClient kbConfig kbServer kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0, some logon scripts on Microsoft
Windows 2000-based clients may not function properly over a dial-up connection.
This may result in Windows 2000-based clients not being installed with the
complete SMS 2.0 client software. The client installation process may stop
(hang) after installing Slownet.exe in the %SystemRoot%\MS\SMS\Core\Bin folder.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 2000 dial-up networking adapter is automatically configured with a
subnet mask of 255.255.255.255, regardless of the Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) or remote access server settings. When the IP address is matched
against the subnet mask (255.255.255.255), the resulting IP subnet for the
client is the client's IP address.

WORKAROUND
==========

One workaround for this behavior is to install the SMS client software on the
Windows 2000-based clients while they are connected to the LAN. Then, enable
Travel mode to prevent SMS client removal when the clients subsequently dial in.
Users must always click No for potential de-assignment prompts.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
