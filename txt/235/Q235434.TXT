SYMPTOMS
========

In the debugger, the "Attach to process" list is empty.

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. Before
you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if a problem
occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring the Registry"
Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help topic in
Regedt32.exe.

CAUSE
=====

The "Attach to process" list is populated using a performance counter API.
Depending on the environment and the installed performance counter DLLs, the
code to populate the list may fail.

This bug only affects the "Attach to process" list when running on Windows NT and
Windows 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

Resolution 1:

You should be able to attach to the process using Task Manager:

1. Enable just-in-time debugging (JIT):

   a. In Visual C++, on the Tools menu, click Options.

   b. On the Debug tab, make sure that Just-in-time debugging is selected.

2. Run Task Manager and select the process to attach to. Right-click and select
   Debug.


Resolution 2:

1. Run Task Manager and get the process ID for the process you want to debug.

2. At a command prompt enter the following:

"msdev -p <processid>" (without the quotation marks)
This will start Visual C++ and will attach to the process specified.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest service pack for

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the steps for Resolution 2 do not help, and if Resolution 1 is
unsatisfactory, check the version of the operating system. Even though this bug
is known to occur on Windows NT 4.0 as well Windows 2000, Resolution 2 may not
work on Windows 2000. You may need to go back to a released version of Windows
NT.
