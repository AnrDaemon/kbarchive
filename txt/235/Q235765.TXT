TITLE   :SMS: Local Groups Cannot Write Queries Even With Full Rights

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server version 2.0, administrators often need to be able
to grant Query rights to another individual or group within the organization.

Prior to Service Pack 1 for Systems Management Server 2.0, Administrators were
able to grant full query rights to a user or a group (local or global) but only
the user was able to use the rights. This only worked if the user had been
granted the rights explicitly.

When a local or global group is granted full query rights and then users were
assigned to the group, the users within the group could not act on those rights.
Furthermore, those same users in the groups were able to act on rights granted
to them to create Collections and Packages.

This problem is specific to creating custom queries in the Administrator Console
for computers, software, and so forth within the Queries section. It is not an
issue when creating and running queries in the Status Message Viewer.

When attempting to use the full query rights granted by the Administrator, a
pre-Service Pack 1 site system should see the Queries, New, Query Context menu
dimmed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
