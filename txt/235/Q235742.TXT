PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Hardware Inventory is running on a Systems Management Server 2.0 client
that has a Diamond Stealth II G460 AGP video adapter with the I740 chipset
installed, an exception may occur. The following entries may be logged in the
Hinv32.log on the client:

CLASS - Process Class: Win32_DisplayControllerConfiguration
EXCEPTION EXCEPTION EXCEPTION
CLIEXCEPT (Logged to all threads)
An exception was raised in the application 'Hardware Inventory Agent'
CLIEXCEPT A fatal exception occurred in THIS THREAD. Information follows:
CLIEXCEPT Exception Type : 0xc0000005" CLIEXCEPT Exception Address : 0x408f56"

WORKAROUND
==========

The enumeration of the Win32_DisplayControllerConfiguration class can be
disabled by modifying the Sms_def.mof file. To prevent this problem, set
reporting for the Win32_NetworkClient class to False in the site's Sms_def.mof
file.

For more information on the procedure to do this, please refer to Chapter 10 of
the Systems Management Server Administrator's Guide.
