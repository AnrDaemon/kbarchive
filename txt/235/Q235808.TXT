PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Smsapm32.exe may incorrectly report the successful completion of a package even
though it may not have succeeded. This behavior can occur if the package starts
another instance of itself to complete execution and the second instance does
not finish successfully. A Microsoft Windows 2000 upgrade using Winnt32.exe is
one package that exhibits this behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, follow these steps on the Systems Management Server (SMS)
site server:

1. Stop the SMS Executive and SMS Site Component Manager services on the site
   server.

2. Replace the SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32\Compver.ini file with the
   Compver.ini file from the hotfix.

3. Replace the SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32\<Platform>\Apasetup.exe
   file with the Apasetup.exe file from the hotfix.

4. Replace the SMS\Bin\<Platform>\Smsapm32.exe file with the Smsapm32.exe
   file from the hotfix.

5. Restart the SMS Executive and SMS Site Component Manager services.

NOTE: The default Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) polling
interval is 23 hours. Therefore, it may take up to 23 hours for the hotfix files
to be propagated to the clients. To speed up this process, you can stop and
restart the SMS Client service on each client. You can also create a software
distribution for one of the Resource Kit tools (Setevnt.exe or Cliutils.exe)
along with the appropriate parameter(s) to start a CCIM work cycle. For
information about the proper syntax to use with these tools, see the Resource
Kit documentation.
