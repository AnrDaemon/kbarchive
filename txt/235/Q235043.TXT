TITLE   :SMS: Smsls Hangs Client with Unsupported Network Redirector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a client is running an unsupported network redirector, such as a third-party
TCP/IP stack, running Smsls.bat may cause the computer to stop responding
(hang). Also, running the Systems Management Installation Wizard (Smsman.exe)
with an unsupported redirector may cause the installation to hang without any
error message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem has been observed on a Microsoft Windows 95-based client running an
unsupported version of the Novell InterNetWare client.

Enabling NAL logging on the client and running Smsman.exe may show the following
information in the Wn_manual.log file:

   NAL [2] - Warning: this version of the redirector is not supported.

To enable NAL logging, run the Turn_on_nal_logging.reg file from the
Support\Reskit\I386\Diagnose folder on the SMS 2.0 CD-ROM.

For information about client requirements, see Appendix A of the Systems
Management Server Administrator's Guide. Also, supported Novell redirectors are
documented in the "Integrating Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0 with
Novell NetWare" white paper that is included on the Microsoft Back Office
Resource Kit 4.5 CD-ROM (as a file named Dplyntwr.doc). The latest version of
this white paper is also available from the following Microsoft Web site:
