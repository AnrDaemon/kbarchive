SUMMARY
=======

On high traffic file servers, you can increase file server throughput by
partitioning the workload and segmenting the clients by network and file system
volume.

By using the following practices, users with high-traffic file servers can
increase the file server throughput.

1. Partition the workload across multiple network segments. This increases file
   server throughput by increasing network bandwidth, and improved network
   partitioning.

2. Partition the workload across multiple file system volumes on network file
   shares. This reduces file system contention, resulting in better usage of the
   server resources. Again, the end result is better file server throughput.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example explains how you can use these practices to increase your
file server throughput.

A network file server with 1,000 users, who each have been assigned a network
file share to store their work and documents, can increase file server
throughput by:

1. Segmenting the clients across multiple network segments; in this case, a
   customer can have four network segments with the users divided evenly amongst
   segments.

2. Distributing the user file shares across different file system volumes;
   depending on the number of disks and the amount of disk space, this can vary.
   Dividing the users evenly amongst volumes would limit any contention that
   could be caused by a single NTFS volume.
