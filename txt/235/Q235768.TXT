TITLE   :SMS: Using /Upgrade Switch with Command Line Setup Causes Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run the Systems Management Server setup to upgrade a version 1.2 site
from a command line, the following error appears:

   Setup cannot upgrade the Systems Management Server database. Contact your SQL
   Administrator.

Microsoft has seen the problem in both Single Domain and Master Domain
environments. This error occurs regardless of the security implementation of
Microsoft SQL Server.

When an administrator runs SETUP /UPGRADE from the x:\smssetup\bin\i386 directory
on the Systems Management Server CD, the error is generated. Setup starts
normally, then it begins the shutdown for the 1.2 site, and creates the server
connection account. When the setup process trys to upgrade the site database the
stops responding.

At this point, the Systems Management Server 1.2 site is unrecoverable. If an
administrator attempts to run it from the User Interface, it does not respond.
If setup is run from the Configuration Manager, it does not respond. If a site
reset is attempted, the reset will fail with Site Configuration Manager unable
to start, and a Site Control file that cannot be written to.

If a Systems Management Server site is upgraded using the Wizard provided in the
Administration Console, the database is converted with no errors.

MORE INFORMATION
