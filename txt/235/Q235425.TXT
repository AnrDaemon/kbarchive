TITLE   :CreateFile() Can Cause Leak in Paged Pool Memory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fixkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer running Windows NT may become unresponsive and may display an
error message indicating that the computer is running low on virtual memory.

In addition, Performance Monitor shows a rise in paged pool memory usage that
never declines.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if a program makes a call to the Win32 application
programming interface (API) function CreateFile(), and passes a drive letter
that is mapped to a remote file system using the Windows NT redirector (this
results in an error value of ERROR_INVALID_NAME). The Windows NT redirector did
not release memory allocated to attempt this operation.



RESOLUTION
==========
