PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSecurity kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server Security Wizard's account drop-down list will not
list User Accounts or User Groups from a Trusted Domain if the current user is
logged into an account from the trusting domain.

WORKAROUND
==========

This is a problem with the account list display pull-down box in the Security
Wizard interface. Although the accounts are not listed, they can be entered
manually by typing the Domain\Account for the trusted domain in the dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The behavior in the Systems Management Server Security Manager should be the
same as the Windows NT User Manager. The Trusted Domain User Accounts/Groups
should be listed.
