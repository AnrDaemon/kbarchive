TITLE   :SMS: Unable to Delete Site System from Administrator UI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1

KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to delete a Site System with the Systems Management Server
(SMS) Administrator UI under

Systems Management Server
   Site Database (site code - site name)
      Site Hierarchy
         site code - site name
            Site Settings 
               Site Systems 

the server disappears, and then reappears when upon refresh.

This problem occurs for systems which once served as a Client Access Point (CAP)
site system role.

SMS 2.0 (without a service pack) will raise status message errors every hour if
the server can not be uninstalled successfully.

CAUSE
=====

The Site System carries the Component Server role and the Administrator UI is
designed to not remove any site systems which are still serving an active site
system role.

After all Administrator-definable roles are removed from the Site System
properties of the system to be removed, Site Component Manager (an SMS core
service) is instructed to "de-install" and remove the x:\SMS directory
structure, SMS Executive service, and registry entries from the server in
question. After the deinstallation of the server is complete, the Site Component
Server disappears, or 7 days after a retry attempt has failed, at which point
the Site Component Manager assumes the server is permanently offline, the role
of Component Server is removed.

The Component Server role is not definable by the Administrator and cannot be
modified manually.

WORKAROUND
==========

Wait for Site Component Manager to remove Component Server role after successful
deinstallation of the Client Access Point or wait for the 7-day retry interval
to pass, and then delete the server within the SMS Administrator UI.

If the server in question is no longer available and SMS is in use without a
service pack, upgrade to the latest Service Pack.
