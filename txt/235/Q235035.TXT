SYMPTOMS
========

When you place a visual control (such as a PictureBox, Image, ListView,
TreeView, RptText, RptLabel, and so forth) on a form when you are running Visual
Basic 5.0 or 6.0 on Microsoft Windows 98-based system, Visual Basic crashes with
the following error messages concerning the Graphics Device Interface (GDI)
module:

   An Error has occurred in your program, to continue working anyway click on
   Ignore...

If you click the Close button, the following error message is displayed:

   The program has performed an illegal operation...

If you click the Details button, the following error message is displayed:

   VB6 caused a divide error in module GDI.EXE at 0004:000006fe.

   -or-

   VB5 caused a divide error in module GDI.EXE at 0004:000006fe.

The exact memory address may vary.


CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of a video driver that is not compatible with
Visual Basic 5.0 or 6.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restarting in Safe Mode (which uses the Windows standard VGA driver) eliminates
the errors. Obtain and install a newer version of the video driver or try
running the current video driver at a lower resolution or at a lower color
depth.
