TITLE   :SMS: APM Cannot Run a Command Line That Contains a Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbSoftwareDist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the command line for a program contains a space, the advertisement does not
work. You receive the following error message after clients attempts to run the
advertisement:

   10003
   An error occurred while preparing to run the program for advertisement
   <Advertisement_ID ><Advertisement_Name>.The operating system
   reported error 2: The system cannot find the file specified

   Additional program properties:
   Command line: <Command Line>
   Working directory: <Working Directory>
   Drive letter (? = any):
   Possible cause: This message most commonly occurs when the program's
   command-line executable file could not be found, when a required drive letter
   connection to a distribution point could not be established, or when the
   program is configured to use the Windows NT Client Software Installation
   Account but the account is not specified, could not be found, or does not
   have the appropriate permissions. Solution: Check each of the items listed
   above.

CAUSE
=====

When APM attempts to run the command line, it looks for only the string value
that precedes the space. For example, if you rename Notepad.exe to "Run
Notepad.exe", APM looks only for the "Run" string to start.

WORKAROUND
==========

Rename the program file to one contiguous name without any spaces.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
