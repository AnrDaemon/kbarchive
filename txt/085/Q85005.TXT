TITLE   :Wrap Title for Icons Appears to Fail in Windows 3.1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Wrap Title feature for icons in the Windows 3.1 Program Manager may appear
to fail even when this option is selected in the Desktop dialog box of Control
Panel.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem

1. In Control Panel, choose the Desktop icon.

2. Under Icons, reset Spacing to 75 (default) and select the Wrap Title check
   box.

3. From the Options menu in Program Manager, choose Auto Arrange. (A check mark
   should appear beside the command.)

4. Quit Windows.

Title wrapping on icons should now be enabled when you restart Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the icons in a program group have been arranged using a relatively low value
for icon spacing and you then significantly increase the icon spacing without
rearranging the icons, the titles may appear not to wrap when you restart
Windows 3.1. When you increase the icon spacing, Program Manager assumes that
the icons are spaced accordingly and therefore positions the titles as if there
is enough room to display the titles on one line. This behavior occurs only if
the Auto Arrange command is inactive (not selected).
