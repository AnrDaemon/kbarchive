The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows version 3.1 SETUP.SHH file's [endinstall] section can use
a CONFIGFILES=DONTSAVE switch to disable Setup from prompting you to save and
rename the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN.

This is useful when installing Windows to a diskless workstation that is using
boot ROMs that contain images of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Without
this setting, Windows displays error messages during Setup that require you to
make choices. This defeats the purpose of using SETUP.SHH to automate the setup
process.

You can have the switches CONFIGFILES=DONTSAVE and CONFIGFILES=MODIFY in the same
SETUP.SHH file at the same time. In the case of a boot ROM, you would only want
the CONFIGFILES=DONTSAVE switch active, or you will get an error message. After
setup, you should make sure that the boot ROM's CONFIG.SYS file is loading
Windows 3.1's HIMEM.SYS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows Automated Setup option (also called Batch Mode Setup) allows you to
write a script file for Setup (an example called SETUP.SHH comes with Windows
3.1), which automates the setup and requires little user input. You can
configure Setup to automatically install certain printers, applications,
hardware options, and other options. The following is a sample command line:

   SETUP /N:X:\NETWIN\SETUP.SHH /N

NOTE: SETUP.SHH is an example; you can use any acceptable filename with an
extension of .SHH.

For more information on this feature, refer to pages 75-82 of the "Microsoft
Windows Resource Kit" manual for operating system version 3.1.
