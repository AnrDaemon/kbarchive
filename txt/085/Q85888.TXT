SUMMARY
=======

To display a customized Windows Calendar file when you start Windows, you can
add the Calendar file as an icon in the Windows Startup group. However, you
cannot set the location or size of the calendar window as it first appears on
the screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To display your daily Calendar file at Windows startup, do the following:

1. Run Calendar from the Accessories group.

2. Add any information you want to your daily calendar, and choose the desired
   Calendar settings.

3. From the File menu, choose Save As. In the File Name box, enter a new name
   for the file (for example, MY.CAL).

4. Open the Startup group.

5. From the Program Manager File menu, choose New. Select the New Program Item
   button and choose OK.

6. In the Program Item Properties dialog box, choose Browse.

7. Enter *.CAL in the File Name box.

8. Select MY.CAL from the appropriate subdirectory and choose OK. The correct
   path and filename will appear in the Command Line box.

The next time you start Windows, your Calendar file will appear as the first open
window on the screen. If there is more than one icon in the Startup group, they
are opened in order starting from the upper left corner, and going from left to
right in the Startup group window.

If you decide you want your calendar to open as an icon rather than an open
window, select the Run Minimized option before saving the Program Item
Properties settings.
