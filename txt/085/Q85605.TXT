The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article briefly describes the steps to follow when troubleshooting problems
with the Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Information Required
--------------------

To track or report a problem, you need to know:

 - Gateway version

 - Model and version of board being used

 - Error messages

Isolating the Problem
---------------------

 - Try sending a fax using the fax board software. If it doesn't work, the
   problem lies with the board. Check the board's configuration.

 - If you can send faxes with the fax board software, but not while running the
   gateway, find out what error message is being displayed.

 - If no error message is displayed and the fax is never sent, the problem could
   lie with the actual mailbag being used for fax mail. Check the MBG directory
   for file access problems, and check for any other mail-related problems.

A full description of all error messages is in the "Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax
Administrator's Guide."

Base:

Restarting the Gateway
----------------------

To restart the gateway:

1. Shut down the gateway.

2. Return all items from the fax queue.

3. Delete all items from the fax board queue, using the fax board software.

4. For the Gammalink board only, compress the queue file by running
   GFQRESET.EXE.

5. From the Admin program, compress the RRS.FAX file.

6. Restart the gateway.

7. Send a fax.
