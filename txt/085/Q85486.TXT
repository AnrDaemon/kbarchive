The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 3.07, 4.0, 4.01, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Windows version 3.1 supports a local reboot feature. This
feature allows a user to press the CTRL+ALT+DEL key combination, which
brings up a menu that gives the user the choice of returning to
Windows, ending the current application, or rebooting the computer.

While using Microsoft CodeView for Windows version 3.07, 4.0, 4.01,
4.1, or 4.25, the reboot option must be selected if local reboot is
used. Returning to Windows or ending the current application could
result in Windows becoming unstable.

Note that Windows 3.1 requires the use of CodeView for Windows version
3.07 or later.
