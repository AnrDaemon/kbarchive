 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax cannot return notification to the
Microsoft Mail user, the "Failure to return Sender the confirmation" error
usually indicates a missing P1 directory in the mail database, or insufficient
access rights for the user ID the gateway is logged in as.

Check to make sure the P1 directory exists. If it does, check for access rights
in the MAILDATA directory.
