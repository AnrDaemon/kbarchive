SUMMARY
=======

When you run an MS-DOS-based application (including MS-DOS Prompt) from Windows
version 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode, keyboard input may be remapped to incorrect
characters if the following line is in the [386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI
file:

      Device=CPBVXD.386

For the keyboard to work correctly, either remove this line or place a ";" in
front of it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Central Point Backup for Windows version 7.2 adds the virtual device driver
CPBVXD.386 to the [386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. This driver does not
replace any device drivers internal to Windows, and can be removed without
affecting the functionality of Windows.

To correct the keyboard mapping problem, change the following line

      Device=CPBVXD.386

to:

      ;Device=CPBVXD.386

This disables the driver, and Central Point Backup, from working in 386 enhanced
mode.

For more information contact, Central Point technical support.

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
