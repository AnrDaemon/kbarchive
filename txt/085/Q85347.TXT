The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can test fax boards and drivers by using the software supplied with the
board to send and receive faxes. For example, the Intel Connection Coprocessor
uses the CONNECT.EXE program to send and receive faxes.

Make sure the fax board and software are configured according to the instructions
in the "Installing the Fax Board and Software" chapter of the "Microsoft Mail
Gateway to Fax Administrator's Guide."

Once the board and software are configured properly, try sending and receiving
faxes with the appropriate software. Once the board can send and receive faxes,
the fax gateway can be run.
