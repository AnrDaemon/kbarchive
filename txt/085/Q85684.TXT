PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you rename or copy the compressed QBASIC.EX_ file to QBASIC.EXE without using
the MS-DOS 5.0 EXPAND utility, any attempt to start MS-DOS 5.0 Editor will give
an "Out of memory" message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Editor uses of the QBasic interpretive editor. When QBASIC.EXE is compressed or
is corrupt, Editor will give an "Out of memory" error when loading.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, expand QBASIC.EX_ to QBASIC.EXE by typing the following
from the MS-DOS directory

   " expand [drive:]qbasic.ex_ c:\dos\qbasic.exe" (without the quotation marks)

where [drive:] is the floppy drive location of the compressed file.
