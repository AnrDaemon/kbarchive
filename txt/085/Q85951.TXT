TITLE   :BUG: "Help on Topic Not Found" for Win API with PWB 2.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:2.0,2.1.49
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.1.49 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Microsoft Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 2.0 to view the
Windows API help, some of the hyperlinks don't find their associated topics.

When you first choose Contents from the Help menu and then select Windows API,
the entire top line is highlighted. Clicking any area of the line brings up the
following message box

   Help on topic not found:
   <Function Groups>

followed by a second message box:

   Cannot process context

Also, these message boxes may appear for other topics under the Windows API
category when they are selected. For example, topics Database Version and
Alphabetical Functions also cause these message boxes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Although viewing all the topics in the Windows API category with PWB version 2.0
is not currently supported, the QuickHelp (QH.EXE) utility can be used to view
this information. To run QuickHelp, select the "C/C++ 7.0 Reference" icon from
the program group created by the C/C++ Setup program, or run the utility from
the MS-DOS command line by typing "qh" (without the quotation marks).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Programmer's WorkBench
version 2.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
