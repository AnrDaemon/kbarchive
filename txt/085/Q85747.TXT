======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Printing a document from Windows 3.0 using a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet III
attached to LPT1 on a LANtastic network may generate the following error:

   Cannot print to LPT1.PRN:

Installing the HP LaserJet to LPT2.PRN may resolve this problem.

CAUSE
=====

This problem only occurs when the document contains both text and graphics while
trying to print to LPT1.PRN. However, printing documents with only text or only
graphics does not cause an error.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only known workaround for this problem (on network configurations that will
support LPT2) is to configure the HP LaserJet III driver to LPT2.PRN for
printing documents that contain both text and graphics.

Printing on a LANtastic network requires printing using the LPTx.PRN ports. If
LPT2.PRN is not an option in Control Panel, you must modify the WIN.INI file.
Under the [ports] section, add the following line:

      LPT2.PRN=

This problem does not occur in Windows 3.1. Artisoft LANtastic versions 3.0 and
later are supported under Windows 3.1.
