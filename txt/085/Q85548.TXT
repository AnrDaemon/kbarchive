SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows version 3.1 with an ATI Stereo FX Board installed and you
are using the Creative Labs Sound Blaster 1.0 Driver, you may receive the
following error message:

   A configuration or hardware problem has occurred. Use the Driver option in
   Control Panel to reconfigure the Sound Blaster driver

Attempts to change the Control Panel Setup information for the driver have no
effect.

WORKAROUND
==========

 - Use the RESET.EXE file to reset the Stereo FX Board. The Reset command can be
   placed in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, run from MS-DOS Prompt under Windows, or
   added as an icon in your Startup Group.

 - ATI's Setup program (SPX.EXE) can be used to reset the Stereo FX Board. This
   can be done as follows:

   1. Run SFX.EXE (either outside of Windows, or from the MS-DOS Prompt under
      Windows).

   2. Select Set Power-up Configuration.

   3. Press F10 to save the settings.

   4. Press the ESC key.

According to ATI Technologies product support, ATI is aware of the problem.
