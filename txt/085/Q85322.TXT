The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you install Microsoft Windows version 3.1 on a computer with a Genius 1000
monitor, you must have version 2.2 or greater of the Tiga video ROM and Ran-Ger
driver version 1.5 or later to work with a permanent swap file.

You may receive the following error message if you do not have the updated
drivers:

   Your CONFIG.SYS file contains a device driver that is incompatible with swap
   file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To work with Windows, the Genius 1000 monitor requires the G2BIOS.SYS driver
version 1.5 or later to create a permanent swap file, along with Tiga ROM
version 2.2. Windows is still able to create a temporary swap file with versions
1.4 and later of the Ran-Ger driver, but needs at least version 2.0 or later of
the Tiga ROM.

To obtain the current G2BIOS.SYS driver, contact Ran-Ger technical support.
