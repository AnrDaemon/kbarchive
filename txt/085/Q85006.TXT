SUMMARY
=======

TBMI2.COM is a memory resident utility provided by Novell for distribution on
the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 distribution disks. The Task
Buffer Management Interface (TBMI) is a file meant to be used in standard mode
Windows when the NetWare IPX and SPX functions are loaded. The purpose of the
file is to prevent a task switch in Windows from breaking the communication
between IPX and the various software processes associated with a particular
application.

In more technical terms, TBMI2.COM acts as a buffer and manager between the IPX
and a calling process. If an application process calls IPX and then the task
switcher is invoked, then IPX could send its response to the wrong process.
TBMI2.COM prevents this from happening.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NETWORKS.WRI file states the following:

   TBMI2 enables you to safely run applications that use IPX and SPX functions
   in standard mode Windows or the MS-DOS 5.0 task switcher.

NETWORKS.WRI also explains that Novell suggests loading the file at bootup time
with a batch file. NETWORK.WRI offers no further clarification of the
functionality of TBMI2.COM.
