SUMMARY
=======

Banyan Vines network messages may cause a running MS-DOS-based application to
minimize in Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1. It does not matter
if the MS-DOS-based application is running in a full screen or in a window. This
problem does not occur in Banyan versions earlier than 4.1 patch 5.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the MS-DOS-based application's PIF to Execution: Exclusive, so that no other
application, including the network message, affects the running application.

   -or-

Disable network messaging from the Network option in Control Panel. This prevents
you from receiving messages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Banyan Vines versions 4.1 patch
5 and later. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a Banyan network message is sent to the workstation from a user's mail
program or network print queue, the message appears on the last line of the
screen and minimizes the running MS-DOS-based application.
