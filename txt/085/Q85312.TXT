The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

In Windows operating system version 3.1, a general protection (GP) fault can
occur when the Setup program switches to the graphical portion of the setup.
This error can occur if the directory specified in the [windir] section exceeds
29 characters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows automated setup option allows you to write a script file for Setup.
An example called SETUP.SHH is supplied with Windows 3.1. You may configure
Setup to automatically install certain printers, applications, hardware, or
other options.

The [windir] section in the SETUP.SHH file specifies the location to install the
user's Windows files. Depending on the size of the entry in the [windir]
section, one of many error messages may appear. If the string if greater than 32
characters, WINSETUP will cause a GP fault in CPWIN386.CPL, followed by a GP
fault in USER.EXE, and then drop the user out to MS-DOS with the error message:

   Standard Mode: Fault in MS-DOS Extender

Examples
--------

The following is a valid entry for the [windir] section:

      [windir]

      k:\sys\apps1\windows\stations

   (Note: The entry contains fewer than 29 characters.)

The following entry will cause the Setup program to fail:

      [windir]

      k:\sys\apps\windows\stations\0

   (Note: The entry contains more than 29 characters.)
