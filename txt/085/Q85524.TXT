KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You may not be able to change page size for a Toshiba P351 or P1351 printer from
applications that use the Windows 3.1 common dialog boxes (COMMDLG.DLL).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the page size from Control Panel Printers
utility before printing the document.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows operating system version
3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The page size option may be unavailable (dimmed) for the Toshiba P351 or P1351
in the Print Setup common dialog box. You can work around this problem by
changing the paper size from the Printers option in Control Panel. You can do
this just before printing the document or before starting the application.

All of the applications that are included with Windows 3.1 (such as Write,
Notepad, and Calendar) use the common dialog boxes. Microsoft Word for Windows
version 2.0 does not use the common dialog boxes, and therefore does not
demonstrate this problem.
