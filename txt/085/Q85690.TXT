======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from the Microsoft Windows Write program or another Windows-
based application, you cannot select a device font and make it print bold unless
the printer being used supports this feature.

WORKAROUND
==========

Windows 3.1 and 3.11
--------------------

If you are using Windows 3.1 or 3.11, use TrueType fonts instead of printer-
resident fonts.

Windows 3.0 and 3.0a
--------------------

If you are using Windows 3.0 and a dot-matrix printer, use the Windows raster
bitmap fonts (such as HELVx and TMSRMNx) instead of printer-resident fonts. The
Windows graphical device interface (GDI) can make these raster fonts bold and
send them to your printer.

If you are using Windows 3.0 and a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet or HPPCL4
compatible, then either:

 - Upgrade to Windows 3.1.

-or-

 - Purchase a soft font package that will enable you to print bold fonts.
   Although the HPPCL4 driver can simulate bold for fonts, it cannot be used
   with larger point sizes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A printer-resident font is the same as a device font. A bitmap font is the same
as a raster font.
