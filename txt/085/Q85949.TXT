SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows Notepad opens any file type, including executable files, and
saves them in Notepad format. Saving a file type that Notepad does not directly
support can make that file unreadable by its native application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 3.1 Notepad was enhanced to be enable it to open files containing a
CTRL+Z (end-of-file) character. This enhancement allows it to open any file that
will fit in Notepad. Opening an .EXE file and saving it will make the file
unusable because it will be in Notepad format, not in the format of an
executable file. It may still have the same file size.

Attempting to run an executable file viewed and saved from Notepad may result in
the following error message:

   Insufficient memory to run application; quit one or more applications, or
   free up disk space to increase available memory and try again.

Additional query words: 3.10 file type
