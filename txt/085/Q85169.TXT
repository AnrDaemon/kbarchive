SUMMARY
=======

This information applies to Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1.
Images copied to the Clipboard from MS-DOS-based applications that use full-
screen color graphics may appear in black and white. This does not occur under
Windows 3.0.

Windows 3.0 stores Clipboard images as device-dependent graphics. Windows 3.1
stores Clipboard images as device-independent graphics. The color translation
problem is caused by an incompatibility between device- independent graphics and
MS-DOS-based applications that remap the color palette.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have MS-DOS 5.0, you can perform the following test to demonstrate
whether Windows 3.1 can capture full-screen color graphics from MS-DOS-based
applications:

1. Run the MS-DOS Shell from Windows 3.1 MS-DOS Prompt.

2. Switch the MS-DOS Shell to graphics mode. The video mode can be changed by
   choosing Display from the Options menu.

3. Press the PRINT SCREEN key to send the image to the Clipboard.

4. Run Clipboard.

5. You should see the MS-DOS Shell image in color in the Clipboard.
