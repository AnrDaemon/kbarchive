TITLE   :Windows Msg: Your Pop-Up Program Is Ready to Run
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an MS-DOS terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program from Windows,
you receive the following message:

   MICROSOFT WINDOWS POP-UP PROGRAM SUPPORT

   Your pop-up program is ready to run. When you have finished using it, press
   CTRL+C to close this window and return to Windows.

CAUSE
=====

This message indicates that the program you are currently running is behaving as
a TSR program (for example, bypassing Windows and attempting to make direct
system-level calls).

NOTE: This information also applies to the MS-DOS 5.0 Shell Task Switcher.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If you run an MS-DOS TSR program in a window in 386 enhanced mode and then
unload the TSR and exit the virtual machine, you may continue to receive the
"Windows TSR Support" message even though the TSR has been unloaded.

No mechanism exists to inform Windows whether a TSR has been loaded or unloaded.
Once a TSR is loaded, a flag is set to indicate a TSR is present; therefore, you
receive the message even if you have unloaded the TSR manually.

Windows 95
----------

To work around this behavior in Windows 95, follow these steps:

1. Create a one-line batch file that reads:

   command.com /c

2. Save the batch file with any name (such as Close.bat). Save the file in the
   Windows folder.

3. Use the right mouse button to click the shortcut that calls the batch file or
   PIF that calls the TSR, and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

4. Click the Program tab.

5. On the Batch File line, enter the name of the batch file you created in step
   2 (such as Close.bat).

6. Click OK.
