 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax PC polls the Microsoft Mail database for
messages addressed to fax addresses and submits the messages to the fax board
for transmission. The fax board does the actual dialing and takes care of the
asynchronous transmission.

The gateway also polls the fax board for incoming faxes, converts the images to
DCX format, and (depending on the options set) forwards the fax to the
designated user and sends the fax to the printer.
