======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Microsoft Windows File Manager drag-and-drop OLE functionality to
drag a file from a CD-ROM into an application's document, you receive an error
message. The error message varies depending on the application used.

For example:

   In Microsoft Windows Write

   Problem with Object/Link

   In Microsoft Word

   Word cannot create the Package object

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem use Packager.

For example:

1. Run Write.

2. From the Edit menu, choose Insert Object.

3. From the File menu, choose Import.

4. Select the file from the CD-ROM, and choose the OK button.

5. From the File menu, choose Exit.

6. When asked, "Update (Untitled)?", select Yes.

The object will now be placed into the document.

For more information about the drag-and-drop feature, see pages 58-59 of the
"Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.1.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in OLE's drag-and-drop functionality
version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.
