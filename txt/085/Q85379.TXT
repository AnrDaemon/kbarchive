SUMMARY
=======

If you want to use only certain components of the Windows Resource Kit (WRK) for
Windows 3.1, you should perform a manual installation.

NOTE: The information in this article does not apply to version 2.0 of the
Windows Resource Kit for Windows 3.1. DECOMP.EXE is not included with version
2.0 of the WRK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To manually install WRK utilities, follow the steps below (where x represents
the floppy drive letter of the WRK disk):

1. Create a directory on the hard drive where the WRK files will be stored. For
   example, from the MS-DOS prompt, enter the following command to create a
   directory called WRK31:

   md wrk31

2. Copy the file DECOMP.EXE from the WRK disk to the WRK31 directory on the hard
   drive by entering the following command:

   copy x:\decomp.exe c:\wrk31

3. Decompress the files by entering the following command from the WRK directory
   on the hard drive:

   decomp x:\wrk\*.*

4. Rename all of the files in the C:\WRK31 directory to their appropriate names
   by entering the following four commands from the resource kit directory:

   rename *.ex$ *.exe
   rename *.wr$ *.wri
   rename *.dl$ *.dll
   rename *.hl$ *.hlp

5. Copy the files TOPHOOK.DLL and FILESIZE.DLL into the WINDOWS directory (or
   into the user directory if it is a network installation) by entering the
   following commands at the MS-DOS prompt:

   copy c:\wrk31\tophook.dll c:\windows
   copy c:\wrk31\filesize.dll c:\windows

6. Copy the file VBRUN100.DLL into the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory, or into the
   shared directory on the network by entering the following command at the
   MS-DOS prompt:

   copy c:\wrk31\vbrun100.dll c:\windows\system

7. Create icons for the WRK utilities by following the steps outlined in pages
   78-81 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" version 3.1 manual.
