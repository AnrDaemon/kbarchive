SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, you can format lines, text, and objects as
"embossed." This option is designed to give lines, text, and objects a
bas-relief or shallow 3-D effect.

This effect is achieved by making the object the same color as the background and
then placing a highlight above it and to the left and a shadow below it and to
the right. The offset and direction of the shadow and highlight are not
adjustable.

Because the direction of the highlight and shadow cannot be adjusted, there are
some types of lines or objects that do not look satisfactory when embossed.
Diagonal lines and diagonal object sides, especially those at a 45 degree angle,
do not emboss well.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Draw a diagonal line slanting from the upper left to the lower right of the
   slide. While drawing, hold down the SHIFT key to force the line to comply to
   a 45 degree angle.

2. Select the line. From the Object menu, choose Line Style. Select a wide line
   style for visibility.

3. Verify that the line is still selected. From the Object menu, choose Shadow,
   then choose Embossed from the submenu.

The line is nearly invisible.

This problem also occurs with the default right-triangle shape, which can be
created with the Shape tool. When embossed, only the bottom edge of the triangle
remains visible.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PowerPoint for Windows. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
