-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a screen saver with Windows version 3.1, you may inadvertently
start an application when deactivating the screen saver by pressing the ENTER
key.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent an application from starting, lengthen the Delay Before First Repeat
setting in the Keyboard section of the Control Panel, or use another key or the
mouse to cancel the screen saver.

This problem may be user and keyboard dependent, because it is based on the way
the ENTER key is pressed to cancel the screen saver.

1. Run Control Panel.

2. Choose the Keyboard icon.

3. Set Delay Before First Repeat to a higher.

4. Choose OK.
