The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can reduce the amount of disk space used by Windows by removing unnecessary
sound drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remove unnecessary sound drivers:

1. Open Control Panel.

2. Select the Drivers icon.

3. In the Installed Drivers box, select the driver(s) that are not being used.
   (Note: You cannot select multiple drivers for removal at the same time.)

4. Choose the Remove button.

   A dialog box will appear with the following message:

   This driver is required by the system. If you remove it, your system may not
   work properly. Are you sure you want to remove it?

   This message will appear even though the system may not have any sound device
   installed. It will not affect the operation of the system to remove these
   drivers if the system has no sound device installed. However, this process
   does not delete the corresponding file from the hard drive. You must use File
   Manager or MS-DOS to delete the file from the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.

The following are the sound driver files included with Windows 3.1:
