======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run multiple MS-DOS sessions on a Banyan VINES version 4.11 workstation
running Microsoft Windows version 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode, you may receive the
following error message:

   This application has violated system integrity due to execution of an invalid
   instruction.

This problem does not occur when you run a single MS-DOS session.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the Banyan drivers; Banyan is aware of the problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

To solve this problem, obtain current drivers from Banyan.

As a temporary workaround, try the following:

1. Open the SYSTEM.INI file in a standard ASCII text editor (for example,
   Notepad).

2. Under the section titled [386Enh], add the following line:

   ModifyDOSInt2A=FALSE


This does not completely correct the problem, but it reduces the frequency of the
error messages.
