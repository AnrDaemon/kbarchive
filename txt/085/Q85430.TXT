SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for the SetClipboardData function on pages 826-828 of the
"Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit: Programmer's Reference, Volume 2:
Functions" manual states that data placed on the clipboard in a private data
format is not automatically freed when removed from the clipboard. The
identifiers for private data formats are in the range CF_PRIVATEFIRST through
CF_PRIVATELAST. The statement in the manual is incorrect. Data that is placed on
the clipboard in a private format is automatically freed when the data is
removed from the clipboard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Clipboard data in a private data format is automatically freed when the data is
removed from the clipboard. Windows sends the WM_DESTROYCLIPBOARD message to the
application that put the data on the clipboard before the data is freed. An
application can free any corresponding internal data when it receives the
WM_DESTROYCLIPBOARD message.

Private data in the CF_OWNERDISPLAY format is not automatically freed when the
data is removed from the clipboard. An application must free data of this format
when the application receives a WM_DESTROYCLIPBOARD message.
