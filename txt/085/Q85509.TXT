TITLE   :FIX: ORG Calculated from Label May Fail in 6.0a/6.0b
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0a,6.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 6.0a and 6.0b, if the expression
for an ORG directive is calculated from a label, the ORG directive will not give
the correct results. The origin set by the ORG directive will be off by the
value of the current location counter ($) prior to the ORG directive.

RESOLUTION
==========

The sample code below demonstrates a macro that can be used to correct the
behavior of ORG. This macro should be used only if the expression being supplied
to ORG was calculated using a label. If the expression being supplied to ORG was
not calculated using any labels, the ORG directive should work correctly.

This macro works correctly only under MASM versions 6.0a and 6.0b.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 6.0a, and 6.0b.
This problem was corrected in MASM for MS-DOS version 6.1.

   .CODE
   start LABEL BYTE
      .startup

   finish LABEL BYTE

   ORG ((finish- start)+ 10h)    ; This will incorrectly set
   tst1 LABEL BYTE               ; the origin.

   ORGFIX ((finish- start)+ 10h) ; This will correctly set
   tst2 LABEL BYTE               ; the origin.
