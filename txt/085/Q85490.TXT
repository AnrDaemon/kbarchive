The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows versions 3.0, 3.1 
 - Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK), versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Windows Help Compiler compiles a help project file, the following error
message appears:

   Error P1083: Invalid context identification number

CAUSE
=====

The representation of the context identification number begins with a zero and
contains the digit 8 or 9.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the leading zeros from the number.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows Help Compiler parses a number that has a leading zero as an octal
number. C compilers also interpret numbers in this manner. Only the digits 0
through 7 are legal in an octal number.
