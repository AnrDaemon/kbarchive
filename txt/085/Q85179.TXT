The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play a MIDI (.MID) file on a Creative Labs Sound Blaster (DSP revision
1.0 and 1.5) internal synthesizer, no output is heard.

The following Windows error message may be displayed:

   The current MIDI setup references a MIDI device which is not installed on
   your system. Do you want to continue?

      [Yes] [No]

In other cases, the file seems to play but you can't hear the sound. There is no
error message.

CAUSE
=====

The MIDI Mapper is configured incorrectly.

If the error message occurs, then the MIDI Mapper is configured to use a hardware
device that is not installed in the PC.

If the error message isn't displayed but no sound is produced, the MIDI Mapper is
configured with the Port Name as "Creative Labs Sound Blaster 1.0" or the
"Creative Labs Sound Blaster 1.5" and is attempting to send the MIDI data to an
external synthesizer connected to the sound board using an add-on MIDI
interface. Unless an external synthesizer is connected, no sound is played.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must select "Adlib" or "Adlib general" in the MIDI Mapper.

1. From the Control Panel, run MIDI Mapper.

2. Set the Name to Adlib or Adlib General.

3. Save your changes and restart Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows version 3.1 supplies multimedia drivers for the Creative Labs Sound
Blaster 1.0 and 1.5. The Adlib driver is installed with these cards to access
the built-in Synthesizer chip.

To properly address the internal synthesizer chip on the Sound Blaster, the MIDI
Mapper should be set to "Adlib" or "Adlib general."
