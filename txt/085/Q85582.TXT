PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Changes you make to program groups are not saved in Program Manager, even though
you choose the Save Settings On Exit command from the Options menu.

CAUSE
=====

Each program group has a corresponding .GRP file that stores information about
that group. If the program group's corresponding .GRP file has its Read-Only
attribute set, changes to the group are not saved when you quit Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove the Read-Only attribute from program group files, type the following
command at an MS-DOS command prompt in the Windows directory:

   attrib -r *.grp

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Read-Only attribute is sometimes set for program groups in networked
environments to ensure consistent Program Manager contents at all workstations.
Note that you cannot move program icons between groups whose Read-Only attribute
is set. No error message will appear if a .GRP file's Read-Only attribute is
set.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Type the following command at an MS-DOS command prompt in the Windows
   directory:

   attrib +r *.grp

2. Start Windows and rearrange all the program groups.

3. Quit Windows and then restart it. Note that the changes you made in step 2
   are not saved.

4. Type the following command at an MS-DOS command prompt in the Windows
   directory to remove the Read-Only attribute from program group files:

   attrib -r *.grp
