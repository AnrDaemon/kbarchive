TITLE   :Envelope Orientation Incorrect in PostScript Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you print envelopes to a PostScript printer from Microsoft Windows version
3.1, the output is reversed compared to output from the Windows 3.0 PostScript
driver.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, try one of the following:

 - Edit the WIN.INI file with a standard text editor (such as Notepad) and add
   LANDSCAPEORIENT=270 to the [ModelName, Port] section.

-or-

 - If your printer supports rotating the envelope in the feeder, then rotate the
   envelopes 180 degrees.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PSCRIPT.DRV versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem was corrected in versions 3.52 and later of the PSCRIPT.DRV
file, which now supports the [ModelName, Port] switch, EnvelopeOrient=. When
this switch is set to 270, Windows 3.1 will handle envelopes as Windows 3.0
does.
