The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows version 3.1 on a Novell network running Brightworks'
SiteLock version 3.2 or earlier, if you view the properties (by choosing
Properties from the File menu in Program Manager) of a SiteLock-monitored
program, then SiteLock thinks the program is being run. This causes SiteLock to
incorrectly assume more people are accessing the program then really are.

WORKAROUND
==========

After setting up the icon for the program, exit Windows and restart the
computer. In the future, avoid checking or changing program item properties
without restarting the computer afterwards.


Brightworks Development is currently researching this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SiteLock is a Novell NetWare network terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program
used to regulate the number of users of a monitored program so that license
agreements for the monitored program are not violated.

For example, if you have a 20-user license for version 4.0 of Excel for Windows,
you would configure SiteLock to only allow 20 users to access it at any given
time. When you select Properties from Program Manager's File menu for EXCEL.EXE,
and then choose OK, SiteLock registers this action as running the program, and
will assume the program is running.

The SiteLock and Novell products included here are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
