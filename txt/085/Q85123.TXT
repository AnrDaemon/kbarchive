SUMMARY
=======

When you print with any Microsoft Windows version 3.1 printer driver that
requires a setting of 300 dots-per-inch (dpi) resolution and prints TrueType
fonts as graphics or has the Print TrueType Fonts As Graphics option selected,
vector fonts cannot be used. Windows ships with the following vector fonts:

   Modern
   RomanV Script

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some of the affected printers are as follows:

 - Hewlett-Packard DeskJet Plus

 - Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500

 - Hewlett-Packard LaserJet

 - Hewlett-Packard LaserJet Plus

 - Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 500+

 - Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 2000

If you have your Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet II or III printer configured to
print TrueType fonts as graphics, it will also be unable to print vector fonts.

On some affected printers, you can change the printer resolution to 150 dpi in
order to use vector fonts; however, doing this will disable the use of TrueType
fonts.
