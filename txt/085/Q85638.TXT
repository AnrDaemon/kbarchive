SUMMARY
=======

Page 17, chart 1.8, of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for
Windows 3.1 states the following in the fifth flowchart step:

   Note: The SMARTDrive command line can be edited to allow caching of "stacked"
   volumes by adding a +<drive> (where <drive> is a "stacked"
   volume). If caching...

The +<drive> parameter is incorrect. The correct command line syntax to
turn on the SMARTDrive disk cache is as follows:

   C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE <drive>+

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMARTDrive will automatically detect the existence of Stacker and cache the
underlying Stacker drive. SMARTDrive should not be used to cache a Stacker
volume. Typing SMARTDRV /? at the MS-DOS prompt lists the command line
parameters for SMARTDrive with their meaning.

Additional query words: 3.10 wrk docerr smartdrv smartdrive
