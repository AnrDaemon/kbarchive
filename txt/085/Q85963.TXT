SUMMARY
=======

Lotus Development Corporation has confirmed that 1-2-3 for Windows allows you to
save a file with a space in the filename. However, File Manager cannot work with
these files because they do not follow MS-DOS guidelines on filenames.

An error message will be displayed if one of these files is manipulated in File
Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

File Manager operations cannot be used on a file that does not follow MS-DOS
guidelines for filenames. Deleting a file with a space, for example "MY
FILE.WK1", may give the following error message:

   Cannot delete file C:\123W\MY_FILE.WK1: Cannot find file. Make sure the
   correct path and filename are specified.

A similar error message may appear in File Manager if the file is renamed or
copied.

MS-DOS requires that a filename not contain a space, comma, backslash, or period
(except the period that separates the name from the extension). A complete list
of MS-DOS filename restrictions can be found on page 69 of the "Microsoft MS-DOS
User's Guide and Reference" version 5.0 manual.

we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
