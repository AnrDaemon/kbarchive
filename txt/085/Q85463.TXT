SYMPTOMS

When you insert a packaged .WAV file into version 2.0 of Word for Windows
running in Microsoft Windows version 3.1, you may receive a general protection

sound directly.

2. From the Insert menu, choose Object.

3. Choose Sound and choose the OK button.

4. Sound Recorder will start.

5. From the Edit menu, choose Insert File.

7. From the File menu, choose Exit.

8. When prompted to Exit and Update, choose Yes.

The sound object (.WAV) is now inserted into the document.
