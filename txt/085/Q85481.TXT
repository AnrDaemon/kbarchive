The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

If you are having keyboard-related problems in applications run from Microsoft
Windows operating system version 3.1, then you may need to add MS-DOS's KEYB.COM
command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Add KEYB.COM.
----------------------

1. Edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file with a standard ASCII text editor, such as
   Notepad.

2. Add the following line if you are using MS-DOS versions 4.x or 5.0:

   C:\DOS\KEYB US

   The following line may be necessary if you are running MS-DOS 3.3:

   C:\DOS\KEYB US,, C:\DOS\KEYBOARD.SYS

   If the system does not seem to realize that a 101-key keyboard exists and you
   are using MS-DOS 5, the following command will force enhanced keyboard
   support:

   C:\DOS\KEYB US /E

   Note: In MS-DOS versions earlier than MS-DOS 3.3, the equivalent of KEYB US
   does not exist.

KEYB.COM replaces the ROM BIOS INT 09h keyboard interrupt handler with its own
routine. This may allow handling of the keyboard in a manner that does not
conflict with A20 handling.

Additional query words: 3.1 3.11 3.10 himem.sys
