SUMMARY
=======

When Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.0 is installed on a system with
Microsoft Windows, Norton Desktop adds two new options to File Manager: an
Undelete command is added to the File menu, and a Norton menu is added (to the
left of the Help menu).

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0, it adds the above two options
under the File Manager menu bar, and makes the following changes to the
WINFILE.INI file:

 - In the [AddOns] section of the file, Norton Desktop adds the line:

         NortonDesktopDLL=NFMEXT.DLL
       

 - In the [Settings] section of the file, Norton Desktop adds the line:

   undelete.dll=NFMEXT.DLL

 - Norton Desktop adds a new section called [Norton Desktop] and adds the line:

   ToolsTitle=&Norton

As a result of these modifications to WINFILE.INI, File Manager is modified in
the following ways:

 - An Undelete command is added to the File menu. The Undelete command allows
   you to undelete files from File Manager.

   allows quick access to the following Norton Desktop programs:
