SUMMARY
=======

The following are instructions for embedding documents into a version 3.0
Microsoft Mail for Windows, mail message. Using these instructions will not
submit large attachments to the Microsoft PC Mail database, but will contain
only the pointer to the file (which can be a document, executable file, and so
forth). The instructions direct how to embed a pointer to a document on a
Microsoft LAN Manager network (or 100 percent compatible). This is a much more
efficient use of the PC Mail system and will also result in less disk space
being tied up by the Mail Message File (MMF).

1. While composing a message, choose Insert Object from the Edit menu and select
   Package.

2. From Packager, choose Command Line from the Edit menu. Type the UNC path name
   of the file. Such as:

   \\SERVER\SHARE\DIR1\DIR2\FILENAME.EXT

   NOTE: If the server share is password protected, you will receive the error
   message:

   Cannot find \\SERVER\SHARE\FILENAME.EXT. Do you want to create a new file?

   There is no way to force a password.

3. Select an icon for the package using the Insert Icon button. If desired,
   enter a label by choosing Label from the Edit menu.

4. Close Packager and send the message.
