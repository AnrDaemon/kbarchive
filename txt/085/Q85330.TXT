TITLE   :BUG: GetModuleFileName() Returns Relative File Path
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the GetModuleFileName() function returns a reference to a dynamic-link
library (DLL) file, the reference is relative (not fully qualified) under the
following circumstances:

 - One of the directory references in the MS-DOS PATH environment variable is
   relative. Assume that the relative directory reference refers to drive X.

 - An application is implicitly linked to a DLL. The DLL is installed in the
   current (default) directory of drive X.

 - The application is installed in a directory other than the one in which the
   DLL is installed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following describes the situations under which this problem occurs:

 - The PATH statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file resembles the following:

      PATH=C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS;D:.;C:\APPS

   The relative reference in this path refers to drive D.

 - Run an application from the C:\WINDOWS directory that implicitly links to a
   DLL that is stored in the current (default) directory of the D drive.

 - If any application calls the GetModuleFileName() to retrieve the file name
   for the DLL, the function returns a relative reference to the file (for
   example, D:.\DLL.DLL).
