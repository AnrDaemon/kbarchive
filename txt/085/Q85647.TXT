======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Mail administrator tries to delete a user from the Postoffice Address
List (POL) using the Mail Administrator (ADMIN.EXE) program provided with
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the following error message may appear:

   Notice 56
   Error deleting user address in Postoffice Address list.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the POL has a missing or corrupted record for the user
(for example, if the UserID is missing from the POL). The cause of the problem
can be one of the following:

1. The user is a local user, and the record is missing from the ADMIN.NME file;
   however, the access (ACCESS*.GLB) files contain information about this user.

2. The user record is present in the POL but is corrupted.

3. The user is an external postoffice user added to the POL. The user record is
   present in the POL; however, the record is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

The POL information is contained in the ADMINSHD.NME and ADMIN.NME files. These
two files should always have the same exact size, date, and relative time.

The following are corresponding workarounds for the above causes. These steps are
geared for the Mail administrator:

1. If the user is a local user and the record is missing from the ADMIN.NME
   file, copy the POL to your Personal Address List (PAL), add the user there,
   and then copy your PAL to the POL.

   The following procedure assumes that the administrator mailbox still exists
   and the 8-digit hexadecimal ID (hexid) is 00000000. If you are using an
   account other than 00000000, substitute the 8-digit hexid for that account
   for 00000000.

   a. Obtain the user's mailbox name. From the Administrator program Config
      menu, choose Password. Note the postoffice and network names.

   b. At the MS-DOS command prompt, change to the NME subdirectory of the Mail
      database.

   c. Make a backup of the POL by typing the following command:

   " copy admin.nme admin.old " (without the quotation marks)

   d. Make a backup of your PAL by typing:

   " copy 00000000.nme 00000000.old " (without the quotation marks)

      If 00000000.NME is a 0-byte file, copying may not work. You can safely skip
      this step.

   e. Copy the POL to the PAL by typing:

   " copy admin.nme 00000000.nme " (without the quotation marks)

   f. Move up one directory level from the NME subdirectory (by typing CD..).

   g. Start the MS-DOS Mail client and sign in using the admin mailbox by
      typing:

   " mail admin -p<password> " (without the quotation marks)

   h. From the Address menu, choose Enter. At the prompts, type in the mailbox,
      postoffice, and network names you noted in step a above. (If you have
      other address types, choose the Microsoft Mail type and the Admin program
      will then prompt you for the above.) Type in the data noted from Step 1.
      It will bring up the alias. Press the ENTER key.

   i. Quit out of the Mail client.

   j. At the MS-DOS command prompt, change to the NME directory of the Mail
      database.

   k. Copy the PAL to the POL by typing:

   " copy 00000000.nme admin.nme
   copy 00000000.nme adminshd.nme " (without the quotation marks)

   l. Move up one directory level from the NME subdirectory (by typing CD..).

   m. Start the Administrator program. You should now be able to delete the
      problem user account.

   Once you have successfully deleted the user account, delete the ADMIN.OLD file
   and copy 00000000.OLD to 00000000.NME. (If you skipped step d above, you do
   not need to copy 00000000.OLD to 00000000.NME.)

2. If the user record is present in the POL but is corrupted, perform the
   following steps:

   a. Send to Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) the access (ACCESS.*)
      files and the ADMIN.NME file.

      A Support Professional will verify information in the access file, correct
      the record in the ADMIN.NME file, and return your ADMIN.NME file to you.


   b. Copy the corrected ADMIN.NME over ADMINSHD.NME. You should be able to
      delete the user.

      Note: Do not make any modifications to the POL between the time you send
      the ADMIN.NME and the time you receive the corrected ADMIN.NME from PSS.

3. If the user is an external postoffice user added to the POL and the user
   record is present in the POL but is corrupted, send to PSS the ADMIN.NME file
   and the xxxxxxxx.USR file for the external postoffice the user is on.

   To find out the xxxxxxxx number, perform the following steps:

   a. Type out the NETWORK.GLB file. Find the 8-digit number of the network the
      user is on.

   b. Type out that 8-digit.XTN file. This file should show the 8-digit numbers
      for the external postoffices. Find the 8-digit number of the postoffice
      the user is on. That number is the USR file needed by PSS.

      With the ADMIN.NME and xxxxxxxx.USR files, the PSS engineer will verify the
      information in the USR file, correct the record in the ADMIN.NME file, and
      return your ADMIN.NME file to you.


   c. Copy ADMIN.NME to ADMINSHD.NME. You should be able to delete the user.

      Note: Do not make any modifications to the POL between the time you send
      the ADMIN.NME and the time you receive the corrected ADMIN.NME from PSS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the steps above do not work, try one of the following:

1. Double-check the spelling of all problem names, along with the network and
   postoffice names. Often the type number is corrupted to 00, and the name will
   be blank or will contain garbage characters.

2. Obtain and use the ACCTONME utility that is available as part of the Database
   Maintenance Utilities document. To obtain the document containing the
   Database Maintenance Utilities, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q99419 PC DB: Database Maintenance Utilities (Complete)

   There are some side effects to using this utility that are explained in the
   ACCTONME.TXT file included with the utility.
