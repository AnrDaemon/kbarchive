-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a Radius Full Page Pivot monitor with a Radius MultiView SVGA
video adapter, your output may have incorrect line wrapping when printing
TrueType fonts.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, you need to update your Radius video drivers. Contact
Radius for driver information.

NOTE: This problem only occurs with TrueType fonts, so a temporary workaround is
to use non-TrueType fonts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When TrueType text is formatted in Write (or another word processor) and extends
to the end of a line so that the last word wraps to the next line, the text may
print incorrectly. The last word may appear at the beginning of the line,
overwriting the first word.

For example, if your screen displayed the text below in Example A, the text would
print as in Example B.

Example A
---------

   This is a test of word
   wrapping.

Example B
---------

   wrapping a test of word wrapping.
