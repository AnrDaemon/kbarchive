TITLE   :DOCERR: OpenFile Function Documented Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The OpenFile function is documented on pages 4-322 through 4-325 of the
"Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Reference Volume 1" for Windows 3.0
and on 731 through 733 of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit:
Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions" for Windows 3.1.

Each reference includes a table to document the third parameter of the OpenFile
function. Both tables document the use of the OF_CANCEL and OF_PROMPT values
incorrectly. The correct documentation is as follows:

   Value      Meaning
   -----      -------
   OF_CANCEL  Does nothing.
   OF_PROMPT  Displays a dialog box if the requested file does not exist.
              The dialog box informs the user that Windows cannot find
              the file. When the user chooses the Close button in the
              dialog box, OpenFile returns the HFILE_ERROR error value.
