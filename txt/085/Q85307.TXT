 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have a sound card installed on your system, and Microsoft Windows stops
responding (hangs) when starting or exiting.

CAUSE
=====

An outdated or inappropriate sound driver may be causing the problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

Disable the system exit sound. To disable the sound, follow these steps:

1. Choose the Sound icon in Control Panel. In the Events box, select Windows
   Start or Windows Exit (depending on when the problem occurs).

2. In the Files box, select <none>.

3. Choose the OK button.

You can accomplish the same thing by editing the WIN.INI file as follows.

1. Open the WIN.INI file in a text editor (Windows Notepad, for example).

2. Comment out the following line in the [sounds] section

        SystemExit=chimes.wav,Windows Exit

   by placing a semicolon in front of the line, as follows:

         ;SystemExit=chimes.wav,Windows Exit

MORE INFORMATION
================

Updated drivers are often available from the original equipment manufacturer
(OEM).

Windows may also hang on exit if there is a hardware conflict with some other
device. Contact the sound card manufacturer to verify your sound card is
correctly installed.
