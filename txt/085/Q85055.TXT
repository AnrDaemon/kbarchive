SUMMARY
=======

The most common problem encountered when building a File Format Application
Programming Interface (FFAPI) file is specifying the wrong line termination
character. This is usually identified by error 144, "Unable to partition line
%s".

FFAPI looks for a carriage return (<CR>) by default. If the line
termination character used in the file is <CR><LF> or just
<LF>, FFAPI will have problems parsing the line.

To ensure that FFAPI will parse the file correctly, make sure FFAPI knows what
line termination character is being used. To specify this, use the -F parameter
on the command line, according to the following format:

   Character  Parameter
   ---------  ---------

   <CR>       -F0
   <LF>       -F1
   <CR><LF>   -F2
