KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running version 5.5 of Microsoft Word for MS-DOS from Microsoft Windows,
you may receive the following error message:

   System Integrity Violation

CAUSE
=====

This is usually caused by Word attempting to access an EMS LIM 3.2 page frame
when there is not one.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are three solutions to this problem:

 - Add the Optional Parameter /X to the PIF for Word:

   a. Run PIF Editor.

   b. From the File menu, choose Open and load Word's PIF.

   c. Add the following to the Optional Parameters field:

         /X

   The /X disables Word from using EMS memory.

   -or-

 - Change the EMS Memory option in the PIF to:

      KB Required 0    KB Desired 0

   -or-

 - Ensure that Windows has a LIM 3.2 page frame available. If you are using
   EMM386.EXE for UMB support to load drivers and programs high, then make sure
   you use the RAM switch and not the NOEMS switch. You can run MSD.EXE from
   Windows and choose the Memory option to determine what type of page frame is
   available to MS-DOS-based applications running under Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on possible switches and settings for page frames and
Windows, consult the SYSINI.WRI file that comes with Windows. For more
information on the PIF Editor or EMM386.EXE, consult the "Microsoft Windows
User's Guide."
