SUMMARY
=======

When you print to an encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file from Microsoft Windows
version 3.1 using the PSCRIPT.DRV version 3.5 or 3.51 driver, the output file
does not contain a tagged image file format (TIFF) or Windows metafile (WMF)
preview graphic like those associated with EPS files produced with Adobe
Illustrator or CorelDRAW.

This feature may be included in a future release.

EPS files are device independent, which means they can be imported into other
applications that support EPS files and may be using a different type of
PostScript printer. The version 3.5 and 3.51 Windows PostScript printer drivers
support a Mirror option that flips the output of the PostScript job so that it
is reversed or mirrored, based upon the printer selected. Therefore, you cannot
use the Mirror option when printing to an EPS file that has been imported into
another document because EPS files are device independent and the Mirror option
is device dependent.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In general, an EPS file is an ASCII text file that contains Adobe page
description language describing a bounding box and the text and/or graphics
within it. An advanced version of the EPS file also contains a TIFF or WMF
graphic used to represent the contents of the EPS file.

The TIFF or WMF file is required to render the picture on devices that are
non-PostScript, such as a display. Without this file, there is no way for you to
see the image before printing it. EPS files that do not contain these
non-PostScript representations cannot support what-you-see-is-what-you-get
(WYSIWYG) functionality because the images cannot be displayed on screen. This
causes a conflict because many applications offer WYSIWIG functionality.

EPS files cannot be sent directly to a PostScript printer with reliable results.
Instead, first import the EPS file into a document. Then, from the application,
print the file as part of that document.

EPS files cannot be printed to non-PostScript printers. If the EPS file has an
attached TIFF graphic, you may be able to import the TIFF graphic into your
application and then print the TIFF file instead of the EPS file.

How to Print an EPS File from Windows
-------------------------------------

1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Printers icon.

2. Choose the Setup button, then choose the Options button.

3. Select the Encapsulated PostScript File option button and type a filename in
   the Name box.
