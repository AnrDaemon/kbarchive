======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade from an earlier version of Windows to a later version of
Windows or Windows for Workgroups, the logo screen (which is displayed with you
start Windows or Windows for Workgroups) is not updated.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory contains outdated
versions of the VGALOGO.RLE and VGA.DRV files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, expand the VGALOGO.RLE and VGA.DRV files from the
latest Windows or Windows for Workgroups disks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following table shows the correct file sizes and dates for VGALOGO.RLE:

Windows 3.1       Windows 3.11       WFWG 3.1          WFWG 3.11
---------------------------------------------------------------------

26,778/3-10-92    26,778/12-31-93    35,704/9-30-92    35,784/11-1-93

The following table shows the correct file sizes and dates for VGA.DRV:

Windows 3.1       Windows 3.11       WFWG 3.1          WFWG 3.11
---------------------------------------------------------------------

73,200/3-10-92    73,200/12-31-93    73,200/9-30-92    73,200/11-1-93

To have the Windows or Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or 3.11 logo screen appear,
expand these files from the original Windows or Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or
3.11 disks.

The EXPAND utility should be installed in the Windows directory. With the
appropriate disk in drive A, enter the following commands at the MS-DOS command
prompt (press ENTER after each line):

   expand a:\vgalogo.rl_ c:\windows\system\vgalogo.rle
   expand a:\vga.dr_ c:\windows\system\vga.drv

After you have expanded the files, start Windows and check for the new logo
screen.

If the new logo screen still does not appear, the Windows 3.1 (or 3.11) VGA
display driver may not be installed. To install the VGA display driver follow
these steps:

1. Quit Windows.

2. Change to the C:\WINDOWS directory and type "setup" (without the quotation
   marks).

3. Check the Display setting for either an OEM display driver or the VGA version
   3.0 driver. If either of these appear, you must install the new Windows 3.1
   VGA driver with the following steps:

   a. Use the ARROW keys to select Display, then press ENTER.

   b. Select VGA from the list of video drivers, then press ENTER.

   c. Accept the configuration and insert the appropriate Windows disk.

4. After the VGA display driver is installed, restart Windows.
