-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When you try to print gray scale graphics images using a Microsoft Windows 3.1
printer driver, the images may print as black if the Intensity Control under the
Options dialog box in the printer setup is set towards "darker" on the control
bar.

To allow these images to print correctly, move the Intensity Control towards
"lighter" on the bar.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Intensity Control increases or decreases the darkness of graphics in a
printed document. This is part of the Options dialog box that is used to specify
the fineness of graphics and the darkness and print quality of text. If, when
setting up the printer driver, the Intensity Control scroll box is too far to
the left, the graphics may appear to be too dark, to the point that grays and
blacks on the screen will all print as black.

This option is available from any printer that uses UNIDRV.DLL. This includes
many of the Windows 3.1 printer drivers, including the Hewlett-Packard (HP)
DeskJet drivers, and many of the Panasonic and Epson printer drivers.

If your printer has this option you can get to it by doing the following:

1. Select Control Panel from the Main group in Windows.

2. Select the Printers icon.

3. Choose the Setup button, then choose the Options button. The Intensity
   Control settings should now be available.

   Move the Intensity Control scroll bar with your mouse, or use the TAB key to
   highlight the box and press the ARROW keys to move the box to the desired
   intensity settings.
