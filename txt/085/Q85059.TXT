SUMMARY
=======

Here is a brief summary of the limitations of the File Format Application
Programming Interface (FFAPI):

1. There is no way to get addressing information. The address of a user or a
   group must be known before building the FFAPI file.

2. The FFAPI programs are single DOS processes. They must be run from a DOS
   workstation, and nothing else can be running on that machine. They are not
   Windows compatible.

3. FFAPI does not limit message size. FFAPI could put a huge file into a user's
   mailbag, but the mail program itself would be unable to read it because of
   memory problems.

4. FFAPI processes only the first fifty items found in the queue. Once these
   have been distributed, FFAPI processes the next fifty items. This applies to
   both incoming and outgoing mail.
