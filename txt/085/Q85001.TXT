SUMMARY
=======

If you are restoring data from an SCSI tape drive to an SCSI hard drive using
Sytos Plus tape backup software version 2.0 and you have SMARTDrive version 4.0
configured for Write Behind caching, your system may hang after displaying the
following error message:

   A serious disk error has occurred on drive x: press R for retry.

SMARTDrive (SMARTDRV.EXE) version 4.0 is included with Windows 3.1.

To correct this problem, reconfigure SMARTDrive to perform read caching only.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMARTDrive version 4.0 is trying to write to the SCSI fixed disk when it detects
a timer tick. At the same time, the SCSI tape drive restore program is in the
middle of communicating with the SCSI tape drive. This confuses the restore
program and the SCSI software because the SCSI bus gets told to do something
else while it is in the middle of a tape access command.

At this point, the system is locked up. Pressing the R key works correctly
because the SCSI bus is busy with the TAPE command which is also hung due to the
SMARTDrive drive access to the SCSI fixed disk.
