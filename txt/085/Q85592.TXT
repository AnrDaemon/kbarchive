======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the path in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file does not contain the drive letter for the
Windows directory, you may receive the following error message when installing a
Windows-based application through Program Manager:

   Windows Directory does not exist.

The following is an example of a path statement that does not specify a drive:

   path c:\dos;\windows;\excel;\access

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the path is set according to the example above, and you run the MS-DOS Prompt
in Windows and type "set" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command
prompt, the environment variable will be the same syntax as found in the path.
Therefore, the environment for Windows will be WINDIR=\WINDOWS, which does not
specify the drive letter designation. If this is the case, then some Windows
installation programs may fail to find the Windows directory. Adding the drive
letter for Windows in the path should solve this problem.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.1 3.11
