======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Windows Setup in custom mode on a machine that does not
have an existing copy of Windows 3.1, you may be given the option to run the
tutorial when it is not available.

CAUSE
=====

If you choose not to install the Windows accessories, the tutorial files
(WINTUTOR.*) will not be installed. If you then select the option to run the
tutorial, Setup will continue as if you had elected to skip the tutorial.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.1 3.11
