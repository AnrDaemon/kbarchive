SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (FFAPI) includes programs that allow
MS-DOS remote workstations to participate in Microsoft Mail. The FFAPI remote
Get (RMTGET.EXE) program gets messages contained in the Mail Remote program data
files and places them into an MMFF output MS-DOS file. The FFAPI remote Put
(RMTPUT.EXE) program puts messages contained in an MMF file into the MS-DOS Mail
Remote program data files.

Detailed information on the command line options of the Remote Application File
Format Application Programming Interface (FFAPI) is in the "Microsoft Mail for
PC Networks, Software Development Kit Application File Format API" manual.
