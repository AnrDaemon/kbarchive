SUMMARY
=======

If you try to set up a swap file on a Banyan Vines network drive from Microsoft
Windows 3.1, you will only be able to set up a temporary swap file, and only on
network drives where you have full access. Network drives do not support the
INT13 calls needed for a permanent swap file.

When you run the 386 Enhanced option from Control Panel, the Virtual Memory
option will only show your local hard drive and the network drives to which you
have full access.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.1 3.11
