TITLE   :Manual Feed Selection Not Working in the QMS PS2200
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Manual Feed selection for the QMS PS2200 (using the Q2200510.WPD, dated
3/10/92, and PSCRIPT.DRV versions 3.5 and 3.51 drivers) does not function in
Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1. It will output blank sheets of
paper.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you want to use manual feed paper, use a different PostScript printer that
has a similar feature set, such as the Apple LaserWriter IINT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows version 3.1
Q2200510.WPD driver dated 3/10/92. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you select most of the PostScript printers that come with Windows 3.1, you
are actually installing two files. The first file is PSCRIPT.DRV, which is the
PostScript driver. The second is a Windows printer definition file (.WPD) that
further defines the PostScript driver with usable features such as paper sizes
and sources.
