======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a document is printed from Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
using the Okidata Microline (ML) 93-IBM driver (OKI9IBM.DRV) version 1.0 at
240-by-216 resolution, the top and bottom margins creep down. This problem does
not occur in all applications. For example, Notepad is not affected by this
problem.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a hardware limitation in the printer that restricts
the advance of paper to multiples of 1/144 of an inch. To print 240-by-216
correctly, you need to be able to advance paper in multiples of 1/216 of an
inch.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set the printer resolution to 120-by-72 resolution,
as follows:

1. Run Control Panel and choose the Printers icon.

2. Select the appropriate printer, then choose the Setup button.

3. Change the Resolution setting to 120 x 72.

MORE INFORMATION

Okidata Technical Support no longer supports this printer because it has not
been made for over five years.
