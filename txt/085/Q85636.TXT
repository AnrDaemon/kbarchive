SUMMARY
=======

American Megatrends, Inc. (AMI) BIOS will produce audible beeps associated with
beep codes during the power-on self test (POST). Depending upon the condition, a
predefined number of beeps are sounded, which are associated with the error
messages below.

NOTE: Some systems produce beeps as part of the normal boot sequence. This
article refers to beeps produced by the AMI ROM BIOS before the operating system
loads.

MS-DOS does not produce beep codes.
