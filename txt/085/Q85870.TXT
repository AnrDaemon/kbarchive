TITLE   :FIX: L1035 Error, FUNCTIONS Statement First in .DEF File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, version 5.3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to link an application fails and Microsoft LINK generates the
following message:

   L1035: syntax error in module-definition file

CAUSE
=====

In the module-definition (.DEF) file, the FUNCTIONS statement is the first
statement in the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the module-definition file to place another statement before the
FUNCTIONS statement. For example, you can specify the NAME statement before the
FUNCTIONS statement, as follows:

      NAME test
      FUNCTIONS:MySeg _FuncName

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in LINK version 5.3 for MS- DOS.
This problem was corrected in LINK version 5.31 for MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LINK version 5.3 introduces the FUNCTIONS statement to the module- definition
file. The FUNCTIONS statement can place a function into a specified segment or
into an overlay.

Additional query words: 5.30
