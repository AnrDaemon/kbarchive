SYMPTOMS
========

If you have Read-Only privileges to a directory on a Novell network, and you
attempt to rename a file using Windows version 3.1's File Manager, the following
misleading error message is displayed:

   

              ERROR RENAMING FILE

   Cannot rename G:\CASTLE.BMP: Cannot find file.
   Make sure the correct path and filename are
   specified.

CAUSE
=====

You that you do not have access to the file because you don't have Write
privileges. To successfully rename the file, you need to have the system
administrator grant you Write privileges to the directory.
