The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you are running Windows, and are connected to a bridged Novell network,
leaving the machine idle may result in the following error message:

   Error reading from network

At this point the machine will probably be locked up, and you will have to reboot
the computer. If you encounter this error message outside of Windows, you will
likely be able to choose Abort from the error message options, save your work,
and reconnect to the network. This is not possible when the network disconnects
when Windows 3.1 is running.

This problem is likely caused by using Watchdog, provided with Novell NetWare
version 3.11.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using a bridged network and leave the system inactive for longer than
15 to 20 minutes, Watchdog will disconnect the bridge. When this happens,
Windows 3.1 will hang.

There is no way to turn watchdog off. The only solution is to set all of
Watchdogs time-out settings to their maximum. This should allow the machine to
sit idle for 15 hours before disconnecting from the network.

For more information on configuring Watchdog, please contact Novell.

The Watchdog product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
