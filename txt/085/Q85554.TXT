SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using Norton Desktop 2.0, you may lose MS-DOS environment space when
running MS-DOS Prompt in Microsoft Windows 3.1 in 386 enhance mode.

Low environment space can cause various problems when you run MS-DOS-based
applications or use MS-DOS utilities (for example, you may have problems copying
files).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, comment out the following device driver in the
[386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file by placing a semicolon in front of the
line "device=vfintd.386," as follows:

        ;device=vfintd.386
