TITLE   :PC Win: Packaged Object Icon Changes After Reading
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the icon for an
object embedded within a message may change after the object is read.

CAUSE
=====


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open Packager and Import a Windows executable file.

2. From the Edit menu, choose Copy, then select Package.

3. Compose a message in Mail for Windows.

4. From the Edit menu, choose Paste Special, then select Package Object.

5. Send the message.

6. Have the recipient open the message.

7. Run the packaged object.

8. Close the running packaged object.

The icon for the packaged object has now changed to the PACKAGER.EXE icon, but
still maintains the caption of the packaged object. When you close the message,
you are prompted to save changes. If you do not save changes, the object retains
its original icon and can be rerun later. If you do save changes, the icon
changes but the executable still can be launched.

This behavior can also be reproduced without Mail for Windows when disconnection
from a network server occurs.

Example
-------

1. Connect to a network server that contains a Windows executable that you don't
   have.

2. Start Write.

3. Drag the executable from File Manager to Write (this embeds the file as a
   packaged object).

4. Disconnect from the network server.

5. Activate the package. The icon becomes the Packager default.
