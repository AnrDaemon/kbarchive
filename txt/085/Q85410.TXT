SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0a Upgrade
README.TXT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

3. NOTES ON MEMORY MANAGEMENT
-----------------------------

3.1 386MAX (5.11 or Earlier):

If you have used the SETVER command to report a different version number to a
program you are loading into the upper memory area with 386LOAD.COM or
MAXHI.COM, also use the SETVER command to report that number to 386LOAD.COM or
MAXHI.COM. For information about the SETVER command, see Chapter 14 of the
MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference.

The new version number is reported to all programs loaded by 386LOAD.COM and
MAXHI.COM.

MAXHI.COM programs supplied with versions of 386MAX earlier than 5.0 are
incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0.

3.2 All Computers Inc. Expanded-Memory Driver (ALLEMM4.SYS):

Version 2.5 or later of the All Computers expanded-memory driver (ALLEMM4.SYS) is
compatible with MS-DOS 5.0 HIMEM.SYS. Contact All Computers to get an updated
driver.

3.3 Problems Loading into the Upper Memory Area:

Some computers with bus master DMA controllers may not be able to load device
drivers or programs into the upper memory area. Try adding a DEVICE=SMARTDRV.SYS
command before any DEVICEHIGH commands in your CONFIG.SYS file.

3.4 Intel Expanded-Memory Driver (EMM.SYS):

If you use Intel's EMM.SYS driver with Aboveboard, use EMM.SYS version 4.0
revision D or later. If you have an earlier version, contact Intel for a free
upgrade.

3.5 XMAEM.SYS and XMA2EMS.SYS:

Setup disables the CONFIG.SYS commands that load XMAEM.SYS and XMA2EMS.SYS. If
your system uses both drivers, replace the commands with a DEVICE=EMM386.EXE
command in your CONFIG.SYS file.

If your system includes an XMA card, remove the REM command that precedes the
DEVICE=XMA2EMS.SYS command in your CONFIG.SYS file.
