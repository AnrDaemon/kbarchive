SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows Terminal uses the following originate string for 100- percent
Hayes compatible modems:

      ATQ0V1E1S0=0

The following defines the string:

AT - Command prefix; precedes a command line
Q0 - Enables result codes to be issued to the screen
V1 - Instructs the modem to display result codes in the numeric
     format
E1 - Echoes commands to the screen
S0=0 - Register that holds the number of rings the modem waits before
       answering the phone (In this case it is set to zero; the
       modem will not answer the phone.)

This string may hang modems that are not 100-percent compatible. Refer to your
modem's manual for your modem's correct originate string.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, disable the originate string:

1. Run Terminal.

2. From the Settings menu, choose Modem Commands.

3. Clear the Originate box.

4. Choose the OK button.

5. From the File menu, choose Save to save your changes.
