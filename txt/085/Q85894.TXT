TITLE   :Program Icon Disappears from Group on a Read-Only Share

SYMPTOMS
========

If you review a program icon's properties by choosing Properties from Program
Manager's File menu, and the group file (.GRP) is located on a read-only network
share, you will receive the following error message twice and the program icon
will be deleted until Windows is restarted:

   Cannot Open Program-Group File 'G:\TESTRO.GRP'

NOTE: This problem occurs when the network share is read-only. It does not occur
if only the group file (.GRP) is made read-only with the MS-DOS ATTRIB.EXE
command. This has been tested in a Microsoft LAN Manager 2.x environment.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not place the group file (.GRP) in a read-only network share. Instead, make
the actual .GRP file read-only using the MS-DOS ATTRIB.EXE command. For
example:

   ATTRIB TESTRO.GRP +R

MORE INFORMATION
================

Read-only groups are sometimes used in network environments to ensure consistent
Program Manager contents on all workstations. Other characteristics of a
read-only group include the inability to move icons within, and between groups.
