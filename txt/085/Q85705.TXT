TITLE   :Compuserve's CIM May Not Run on Packard Bell with SVGA Display
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Computers such as the Packard Bell Legend and Force Computer Systems, which are
configured with an OAK super VGA card, may stop when running CompuServe
Information Manager (CIM) software with Microsoft Windows 3.1.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is due to the software-switching feature of the Packard Bell SVGA
board. When starting an MS-DOS application, the driver causes the display to
automatically switch back to standard VGA mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the VGA display driver included with Windows
3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs with the Packard Bell driver WIN3_800.DRV version 7.02. The
file WIN3_800.DRV is located on the Packard Bell VGA Utilities disk included
with the system. This driver supports 800 x 600 resolution on the OAK super VGA
card (OTI 037 Chip set).


For more information on the WIN3_800.DRV video driver, contact Oak Technologies.
