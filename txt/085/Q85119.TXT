======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to run MS-DOS-based applications under Microsoft Windows version
3.0 or 3.1 in standard or 386 enhance mode on a Zenith TurbosPort 386 (CGA), you
may receive the following error message:

   386 Display Type Mismatch

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can either obtain a modified version of the CGA
virtual display driver (VDDCGA.386) from Zenith, or attempt to use the CGA
Plasma video grabber.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To Obtain an Modified Version of VDDCGA.386
-------------------------------------------

A modified version of the VDDCGA.386 driver is available from the Zenith bulletin
board (BBS). After you have downloaded the driver, it should be copied to your
WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

Using the Windows Plasma CGA Video Display Grabber
--------------------------------------------------

1. If you are not already using the CGA video drivers, run Setup from the
   WINDOWS directory and change the Display entry to CGA.

2. Using a text editor, edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

3. Change the [Boot] section. Change the 386grabber= setting from CGA.GR3 to
   PLASMA.GR3 for Windows 3.0 or PLASMA.3GR for Windows 3.1, as in the following
   example:

         386grabber=plasma.gr3

   -or-

         386grabber=plasma.3gr

4. If you are using Windows 3.0, expand the PLASMA.GR3 file from the Windows
   disks as follows:

         expand a:plasma.gr_ c:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\plasma.gr3

   The driver is located on Disk 4 for 5.25-inch disks, and Disk 5 for 3.5-inch
   disks.

   If you are using Windows 3.1, the file is called PLASMA.3GR. Expand the
   PLASMA.GR3 file from the Windows 3.1 disk number 2 as follows:

         expand a:plasma.3g_ c:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\plasma.3gr

   The driver is located on Disk 2 for both the 5.25-inch disks and 3.5-inch
   disks.

BIOS Upgrade May Be Required
----------------------------

The TurbosPort 386 (CGA) ships with a BIOS version of 2.4, but requires a BIOS
upgrade to 2.4D or later to run Windows properly. However, the BIOS upgrade will
not affect the problem described above. The latest version is 2.7B; the chip
number is 44465103.

MS-DOS Versions
---------------

The TurbosPort computers will run Windows with MS-DOS version 3.1. To run the
Zenith version of Windows, you need the Zenith version of MS-DOS 3.3 or later.
