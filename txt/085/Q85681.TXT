SUMMARY
=======

Future Domain technical support has confirmed that the double buffering portion
of SMARTDrive 4.0 that is provided with Windows 3.1 is not required on all
Future Domain model TMC-8X 8-bit and TMC-16X 16-bit SCSI controllers (where X is
an integer completing the model number).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although Windows 3.1 Setup may install SMARTDrive with double buffering in the
CONFIG.SYS file, it is not required and may degrade the performance of the
computer.

The following is a list of the Future Domain SCSI controller models that do not
require double buffering:

 - TMC-820, 830, 840, 850, 860, 870, 875, 880, 885, 850M, 860M, 885M

 - TMC-1650, 1660, 1670, 1680

According to Future Domain technical support, these particular models of SCSI
controllers do not use DMA access, and would not require the double buffering
portion of SMARTDrive to be loaded.

Disabling Double Buffering
--------------------------

To disable the double buffering portion of SMARTDrive, remove the following line
from the CONFIG.SYS file:

        DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE /DOUBLE_BUFFER

For further information on Future Domain controllers, and how to determine the
SCSI model number, contact Future Domain technical support at (714) 253-0428.
