The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

MS-DOS-based applications running in a window from Microsoft Windows version 3.1
do not support third-party font files (.CPI) used in supporting code pages. It
is possible that these font files will be available when the MS-DOS-based
application is run in a full screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Font file is a parameter used to add additional font information to a device's
code page. For example:

   MODE CON CP PREP=((437) APL.CPI)

This adds additional support for APL.CPI fonts to the display (con), which is set
to code page 437 for the United States.

It is the third-party company's responsibility to design and implement its
font-file code page sets into Windows by supplying, installing, and supporting
additional font files in Windows.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 country driver.sys device 3rdparty
