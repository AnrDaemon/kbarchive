SUMMARY
=======

Most machines that have a sleep mode cannot effectively use 32-bit disk access.
This is true whether the machine implements a "full sleep mode" or a sleep mode
that affects only the hard disk. All sleep modes turn off the hard disk as a
minimum, and turning off the hard disk effectively disables the functionality of
32-bit disk access.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are a small number of machines on which 32-bit disk access can be enabled
even though they have a hard disk sleep mode. This feature is machine specific;
you must contact your computer manufacturer to verify whether or not your
machine has this feature.

The Microsoft Windows User's Guide states the following:

   CAUTION: Using 32-bit disk access may be unreliable on some battery-powered
   portable computers when the computer's power-saving features are enabled.
