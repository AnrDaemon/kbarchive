The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows 3.1 PRINTERS.WRI file incorrectly states in section 6.2 that it is
necessary to disable device contention for LPT1 to print using IBM EPT software.
In Windows 3.1, device contention for LPT ports is disabled by default. To
employ device contention for LPT ports, you must obtain and install the Windows
Driver Library VPD.386 file.

Section 6.2 also refers to chapter 14 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide"
version 3.1 manual as giving more information about setting device contention.
This is incorrect. Device contention is defined on page 247.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Section 6.2 of the PRINTERS.WRI file contains the following text:

   6.2  Printing to an IBM Personal Pageprinter, Using the EPT Port

   For best results, use the IBM Personal Pageprinter Adapter Program
   version 1.3.1 or later.

   If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode and want to print
   to an IBM Personal Pageprinter assigned to the EPT port, you must
   set the LPT1 device contention to never issue a warning. Standard
   mode does not require special settings. For more information about
   setting device-contention options, see Chapter 14, "Optimizing
   Windows," in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
