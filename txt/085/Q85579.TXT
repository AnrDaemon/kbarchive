-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When starting Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, you may receive the following
error message:

   Cannot load dictionary C:\Windows\xxxxxxx.DLL

Verify that the dictionary .DLL file specified in the PENWIN.INI sections below
contains the correct path and filename. By default Windows for Pen Computing
will place the MAINDICT.DLL in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. A full and complete
path must be specified if this file or any custom .DLL is not in the
WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The dictionary .DLL module provides post processing on a recognition result. The
RC_Result is checked against a set of words in an .LEX file. Multiple dictionary
.DLLs may be used. Each user may have a unique set of dictionaries. The
PENWIN.INI contains four sections that reference which dictionary is to be
used.

The following section contains a list of all dictionaries available on the
system. Each entry specifies the path and filename of a .DLL. Note: Nothing
should follow the equal sign.

      [Dictionary List]
      C:\Windows\MAINDICT.DLL=

The following section contains a list of dictionaries to be used by USER X. There
will be a section for each user found in the [User List]. Each entry specifies
the users ID number as well as the path and filename of a .DLL.

      [*User 1.Dictionary List]
      0=C:\Windows\MAINDICT.DLL

The following section contains the name of the MAIN and OTHER dictionaries. The
.DLL listed in [User 1.Dictionary List] searches for the keyword xxxMAIN= and
loads the file specified. Note: This line loads the default English American
lexicon provided with Microsoft applications.

      [MsMainDict]
      enuMAIN=C:\Windows\Msapps\Proof\MSSP_AM.LEX

The following section contains user-specific word lists that the Microsoft User
Dictionary .DLL will search in addition to the default xxxMAIN listed above.
Note: This line loads the custom dictionary created by the Microsoft Word for
Windows spell checker.

      [MsUserDict]
      C:\Windows\Msapps\Proof\CUSTOM.DIC
