-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The only file types that can be sent through the Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax
are ASCII textfiles, and black and white PCX or DCX files.

If the attachment file is a text file or a PCX file, the MAKEDCX.EXE program is
spawned and converts it into a DCX file.

Once the attachment file has been converted, the entire mail item is converted
into a TIFF file by calling DCX2TIF.EXE.
