The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you increase the size of an existing permanent swap file in Microsoft
Windows 3.1, the following message may be displayed:

   Windows will not use more than the virtual memory specified by the
   Recommended Size. Are you sure you want to create a larger swap file?

This message is displayed even if the swap file size requested is less than the
maximum size usable by Windows. The message will not affect Windows use of the
new swap file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you modify the permanent swap file size to be more than the recommended size
but less than the maximum size, the above message will be displayed. Windows
will still increase the permanent swap file size.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.1 3.11 swap file
