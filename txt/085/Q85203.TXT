SUMMARY
=======

StatBar.exe is a sample in the Microsoft Download Center that demonstrates how
to create a status bar for an application. An application can implement a status
bar at the bottom of its main window to provide information to the user. For
example, Microsoft Word for Windows and Microsoft Excel for Windows provide
status bars. The status bar in these applications presents the state of the CAPS
LOCK key, insert mode, extended selection mode, and so forth.

The STATBAR application creates the status bar when its main window receives a
WM_CREATE message. Each time the main window receives a WM_KEYUP message, the
application determines whether the released key is a "toggle key," such as the
CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK, or INS key. If so, the application draws the status bar to
reflect the current state of the toggle key that changed state. When the status
bar receives a WM_PAINT message, the status bar repaints its entire client area.
