The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

To add a file, which resides in a directory other than the Windows SYSTEM
subdirectory, to the list of files that are deleted or renamed by Windows 3.1
Setup, add the path relative to the SYSTEM directory to the filename. For
example:

   ..\ONE.FIL

This entry causes Setup to look for ONE.FIL in the parent directory of the
Windows \SYSTEM subdirectory. It also changes the default directory so that
Setup looks in this directory for all files subsequently listed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The [DelFiles] section of the SETUP.INF file has a sample of this, which is
documented by the following comment in the text of the [DelFiles] section:

      ;All files listed AFTER this point will be deleted from Windows dir.
      ;WARNING: The "..\" is needed, the code depends on it!!!
      ..\setup.inf

Setup is appending the string from the list to the following base string, then
using the final string to provide the path to the filename to be deleted or
renamed:

   C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\

Note: This assumes you have specified C:\WINDOWS as the path for Windows 3.1.

After the Setup has appended ..\setup.inf to the above string, the string appears
as follows:

   C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\..\SETUP.INF

The base string for the next entry is the following:

   C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\..\ 

Additional query words: 3.10
