SUMMARY
=======

In the Windows 3.1 Help application, when the user chooses the History button on
the button bar, Windows Help displays a list of the previous 40 topics
accessed.

If the user closes the Windows Help application and launches it again, Windows
Help creates a new history list. However, if one application launches the
Windows Help application and another application calls Windows Help to display a
different help file, the history list can contain topics from each help file.
This allows the user to move back and forth between help files.

Windows Help version 3.1 does not provide a method to empty the history list and
remove references to any prior help files.

Additional query words: 3.10 WinHelp HC HC.EXE HC31.EXE HCP.EXE
