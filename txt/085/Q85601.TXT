SUMMARY
=======

The "FAX in/out cycle:" parameter in the PROFILE.GLB file controls the polling
for sending new mail through fax gateway, and polls the fax board for incoming
faxes.

For example, setting the "FAX in/out cycle:" to 5 means that the gateway checks
the fax queue for outgoing mail for 5 minutes, then checks the fax board for
incoming faxes for 5 minutes.

For more information on this parameter, see the "Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax
Administrator's Guide."
