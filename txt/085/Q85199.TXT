PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you boot a machine from the floppy drive before running the Setup program for
version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
on the boot disk does not get modified.

For instance, the Setup program prompts you to add the line SHARE.EXE to the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file if you want SHARE loaded automatically. However, when you add
the line, it is not written to the AUTOEXEC.BAT on the boot disk or the hard
drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.00b 3.20
