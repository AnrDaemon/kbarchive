KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Logical Connection sells a printer sharing device that comes with a program
called POPLC.EXE. POPLC has several functions, including clearing the print
sharing device buffer and selecting which printer receives the data stream. If
POPLC.EXE is loaded without the /NORES (non-resident) switch, when the Windows
3.1 portion of Setup starts, the machine either stops responding (hangs) or the
keyboard repeat rate gets set too high.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either do not load POPLC.EXE, or use it with the
/NONRES switch.

MORE INFORMATION
================
