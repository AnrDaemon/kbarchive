SUMMARY
=======

On dot-matrix printers, TrueType fonts only print in the graphics mode of the
printer. Because most dot-matrix printers can only print graphics in near letter
quality (NLQ) or letter quality (LQ) mode, draft (text) mode is not available
when printing a document with TrueType fonts.

Although this may slow down printing significantly, this is the only way for a
dot-matrix printer to use TrueType fonts. A workaround is to use a built-in
printer font.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A dot-matrix printer has two modes of printing: text and graphics. When printing
text, the draft mode is normally available. Because TrueType fonts are sent to a
dot-matrix printer as bitmaps (that is, .BMP files), the printer uses graphics
mode to print them. Thus, draft mode does not operate because the printer is
printing in graphics mode and only prints graphics in NLQ or LQ mode.

To print in draft mode, select a built-in printer font instead of a TrueType
font.
