======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you link two objects in Windows, the Paste Link option under the Edit menu
is unavailable (dimmed) when the file that contains the information to be linked
has not been saved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In this case, the application used to create the file containing the information
to be linked represents the "server application." The application you are
pasting the file into represents the "client application."

For an object to be linked, the client application must know the name of the
server application and the file that contains linked information. When this
information is not available, the Paste Link option will be unavailable.

Sample Solution Using Write and Paintbrush
------------------------------------------

In the following example, Write is acting as the client application and
Paintbrush is the server application.

1. Start Write.

2. Start Paintbrush.

3. Create a drawing in Paintbrush, and save the drawing.

4. Select the drawing using the Pick or Scissors tools.

5. From the Edit menu, choose Copy.

6. Switch to Write.

7. From the Edit menu, choose Paste Link which is available (that is, it is no
   longer dimmed).

A presentation of the Paintbrush-linked drawing appears in the Write document.
