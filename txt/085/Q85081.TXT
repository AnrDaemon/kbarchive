SYMPTOMS

Under Microsoft Windows version 3.1, TrueType fonts may not print correctly on a
QMS-PS 815 PostScript printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, you must upgrade the firmware in the printer.

According to QMS, the QMS-PS 815 printer does not print TrueType fonts if the
firmware was created before TrueType was introduced. The latest version of the
firmware for the QMS-PS 815 is 2.9. The firmware on this printer consists of
five chips.
