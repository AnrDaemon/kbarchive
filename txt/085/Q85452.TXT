PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11,95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Windows, the following error message may be displayed:

   Error Loading SYSTEM.DRV

you are then returned to the MS-DOS command prompt.

When you try to start Control Panel, the following error message is displayed:

   Cannot find the Control Panel Components (files with .CPL extension). Verify
   that they are installed in your Windows SYSTEM directory.

CAUSE
=====

The KRNL386.EXE and/or KRNL286.EXE files are located in the wrong directory. The
first message appears if KRNL386.EXE and KRNL286.EXE files are located in the
Windows directory. The second message appears if the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory
is in your path and the KRNL386.EXE file is in the Windows directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

KRNL386.EXE and KRNL286.EXE should be located in the Windows SYSTEM
subdirectory. To successfully load Windows, move these files from the Windows
directory to the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

In Windows 95, the error can also occur if the KRNL386.EXE file is in the
Windows\Command subdirectory or in the root directory. This file should be in
the Windows\System subdirectory. Note that there is no KRNL286.EXE file in
Windows 95.

If you still receive the error message after moving the file(s) to the correct
location, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
