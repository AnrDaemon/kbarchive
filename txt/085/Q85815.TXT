======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the Windows Resource Kit version 3.1's TopDesk application is abnormally
terminated, one or more applications might be lost outside the visual part of
the desktop.

You can use keyboard commands to position any application, which might have been
lost outside the screen boundaries, back into the visible section of the screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In some cases, such as a general protection (GP) fault or any other abnormal
situation that would terminate the TopDesk program, visual contact with active
applications might be lost.

Steps to Return Lost Applications to the Visible Screen
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Press the CTRL+ESC key combination to run the Windows Task List. The Task
   List dialog box appears with a list of all running applications.

2. Select the application to recover by using the mouse or arrow keys.

3. Choose Switch To. The desired application will be active.

   Selecting Tile from the Task List displays all running applications.

   The TopDesk application is designed to work along with the Windows Task List.
   However, if TopDesk is not active, the following additional steps should be
   completed:

   a. Press ALT+SPACEBAR to open the Control Box menu for the invisible
      application. The application will not be seen at this point, but the menu
      options will be visible.

   b. Select Move.

   c. Use the keyboard to bring the application back into the main screen.
      Notice that the position of the menu itself indicates the approximate
      location of the invisible application. For example, if the Control Box
      menu appears in the upper-left corner, use the DOWN ARROW and RIGHT ARROW
      keys to bring the application down and to the right.
