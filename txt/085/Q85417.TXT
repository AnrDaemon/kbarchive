KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run Windows version 3.1 in enhanced mode on a DEC PC 320SX with
an external Logitech Mouse, Windows may return to the MS-DOS command prompt.


CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a conflict with the built-in keyboard mouse device.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, press CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+DEL to enter the CMOS setup and
disable the DEC PC 320SX keyboard mouse.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DEC PC 320SX is a laptop with a built-in cursor controller that emulates a
Microsoft Mouse. If Logitech drivers are used for a Logitech Mouse, the cursor
controller will prevent the system from entering enhanced mode due to the
Logitech driver.

If the Microsoft or IBM PS/2 Mouse driver is selected, Windows will work in
enhanced mode, but the mouse will not function. Both Windows and the mouse will
function correctly in standard mode.

To resolve this problem and allow use of a Logitech or any other type of mouse,
press CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+DEL to enter the CMOS setup and disable the keyboard cursor
controller that emulates a Microsoft Mouse.
