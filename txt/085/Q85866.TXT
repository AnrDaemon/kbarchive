The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When MS-DOS Shell is interrupted abruptly by a system crash or a system reboot,
a file called #.X (where X is an integer value of 1 or more) may be left in the
MS-DOS directory.

This file is a temporary file containing information similar to the DOSSHELL.INI
file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Shell is a file and program management interface supplied with MS-DOS 5.0 and
6.0. The preference settings for the program are saved in the DOSSHELL.INI
file.

Changing options within Shell may cause a file called #.X (where X is an integer)
to be created. The #.X file contains the original DOSSHELL.INI file with the
updated options.

Normally this file is deleted when you properly exit Shell, but if the system
hangs before exiting, the file may remain in the directory that contains Shell.

If there are problems writing to the #.X file, Shell may get stuck in a loop, and
the file may become several megabytes in size. If this happens, you can delete
the file after exiting Shell.

NOTE: Any settings changed before the system hang or reboot must be set again.
