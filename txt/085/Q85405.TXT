KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a document is printed to an Epson T-750 with US Standard Fanfold 14
7/8-by-11-inch paper from Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the right margin cannot
be set to a value less than 6.62 inches.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, install the Epson FX-286e printer driver to use US
Standard Fanfold paper, and use this driver. You may also need to adjust the
printer's DIP switches. Turn Switch 3 on Bank 1 into the ON position if you are
having problems with the graphic character set.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the T-750 printer driver version
1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
