SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Texas Instruments TI Microlaser PS35 printer driver from
Microsoft Windows version 3.1 with a Texas Instruments TI Microlaser 35 Turbo
printer, the driver's paper tray option does not override the paper tray
selection set on the printer.

There currently is no printer driver available for the TI Microlaser 35 Turbo
printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When used with the TI Microlaser PS35 printer driver that ships with Windows
3.1, the TI Microlaser 35 Turbo printer uses the paper tray selected on the
printer regardless of the settings in the printer driver

The Texas Instruments TI Microlaser PS35 printer and TI Microlaser 35 Turbo
printer are two different printers. The printer driver that ships with Windows
3.1 is specifically designed to operate with the TI Microlaser PS35 printer and
is not designed to support all the features of the TI Microlaser 35 Turbo.
