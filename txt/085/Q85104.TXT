The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When upgrading a Windows 3.0 installation to Microsoft Windows version 3.1,
the Setup program will back up the existing WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI files as
WININI.W31 and SYSINI.W31 before performing the upgrade.

This backup is made every time you run Setup to perform an upgrade, whether
upgrading from Windows 3.0 or running the upgrade over a current Windows
3.1 installation. Therefore, if you upgrade a Windows 3.0 installation to
Windows 3.1, and reinstall Windows 3.1, the WININI.W31 and SYSINI.W31 files
will reflect the changes made to the WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI files by the
first upgrade; they will no longer be the INI files used under Windows 3.0.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 backup setup
