KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an application calls the GlobalPageLock() function specifying the handle to
a block of memory that has been fixed in place by the GlobalFix() function, the
address of the memory block can change.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps demonstrate this problem:

1. Allocate a block of movable memory using the GlobalAlloc() function.

2. Fix the address of the memory block using the GlobalFix() function.

3. Increment the memory block's page-lock count using the GlobalPageLock()
   function.

The address of the memory block should not change between step 2 and step 3
above.
