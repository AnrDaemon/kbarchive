======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet using both Adobe Type Manager
(ATM) version 2.0 and HP soft fonts from Microsoft Windows 3.1, the ATM fonts
overwrite the soft fonts, so that ATM sends the equivalent graphic characters to
the printer, replacing the soft fonts.

For example, let's say you use the HP soft-font package HP 22708A, which gives
you the TMS RMN font in assorted sizes. When you print with ATM 2.0 active,
ATM's Times font is sent to the printer instead of the TMS RMN soft fonts.

CAUSE
=====

This is a problem with ATM version 2.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Edit the ATM.INI file with a standard ASCII text editor, such as Notepad.

2. Locate the [Aliases] section and comment out two lines (as shown below) with
   semicolons:

         [Aliases]
         ;Tms Rmn=Times
         ;Helv=Helvetica
