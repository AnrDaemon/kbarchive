SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows provides an option to set up applications. You can set up
applications located on network drives if the network is connected and included
in the PATH environment variable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Applications can automatically be installed for Windows with Windows Setup. The
Windows Setup icon is located in the Main group.

Windows searchs the specified drive for applications and creates an icon for each
application you select. In Windows 3.1, the search path defaults to "Path" in
the Setup Applications dialog box. Path represents the directories listed in the
path of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file (or the PATH variable).

Other drives may be selected; however, if a network directory needs to be
searched, that drive must be connected and included in the PATH variable.

To connect to a network drive in Windows, from the File Manager Disk menu, choose
Network Connections (Connect to Network in Windows 3.0). You can also connect to
network drives at the MS-DOS level.

Once the network drive is connected, it must be included in the path. From the
MS-DOS command prompt, type

   set path=%path%;x:

where x is the active (connected) network drive.

When viewing the list of drives from the Setup Applications dialog box, the
network drives will be noted as [unknown drive]. Hard disk drives are noted as
[local drive].
