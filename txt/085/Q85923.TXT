SUMMARY
=======

Lotus technical support has confirmed that printing from Lotus Freelance
Graphics for Windows to some Hewlett-Packard (HP) printers at 150 dots per inch
(dpi) can result in corrupted output.

Setting the dpi to 300 or 75 may correct this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to Lotus, this problem has been most evident when printing to HP
LaserJet printers. However, Lotus has no information on this problem with other
HP printers.

As a workaround, Lotus suggests setting the resolution to 300 or 75 dpi. Lotus
has developed a patch disk for Freelance Graphics for Windows that should
correct this problem.

The Lotus product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
