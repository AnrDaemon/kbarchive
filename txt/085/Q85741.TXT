The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

When you start Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and a Windows-based application
simultaneously from the MS-DOS command prompt, the application default directory
will vary depending on whether or not you specify a path for the application.
This behavior differs from that of Windows 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following examples demonstrate the behavioral differences between Windows
3.0 and 3.1 when you start Windows and a Windows-based application
simultaneously from the MS-DOS command prompt.

Example 1
---------

This example assumes you are at the MS-DOS command prompt and the current
directory is C:\DOCS. The following command line starts Windows and Write. The
default directory for Write will be C:\DOCS, the same as the current directory
at MS-DOS before you start Windows. This behavior is true for both Windows 3.0
and 3.1. Type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

   win write.exe

Example 2
---------

This example assumes you are at the MS-DOS command prompt and the current
directory is C:\DOCS. The following command line starts Windows and Write
(WRITE.EXE). The default directory will be different depending on the version of
Windows being used (see below).

   win c:\windows\write.exe

For Windows 3.0, the default directory for Write will be C:\DOCS, the same as the
current directory at MS-DOS before starting Windows.

For Windows 3.1, the default directory for Write will be C:\WINDOWS, the same as
the directory specified for the WRITE.EXE file.

The default directory information applies to all applications started
simultaneously with Windows from the command line; however, some applications
such as Word version 2.0 for Windows have an .INI file setting that will
override the default directory provided by Windows.
