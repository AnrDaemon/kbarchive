The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

SYMPTOMS
========

Colorado Memory Systems tape backup systems may fail to operate with Microsoft
Windows. Some of these units use the floppy drive controller instead of a
separate controller card. If the backup unit fails to operate under Windows, add
SMARTDRV double buffering and DRIVPARM statements for both floppy drives.

WORKAROUND
==========

According to Colorado Memory Systems, you may need to add SMARTDrive with double
buffering to enable the tape system to operate correctly with Windows. You may
also need to add DRIVPARM lines for the floppy controllers. To determine if you
need to add a DRIVPARM command, check to see if the tape drive works correctly
at the MS-DOS level but fails to operate under Windows. The backup may fail from
either the icon or from an MS-DOS session.

To add double buffering, add one of the following lines:

 - For versions of SMARTDRV.EXE earlier than 4.0, add the following line to the
   SMARTDRV.SYS file:

   device=c:\windows\smartdrv.sys /b+

 - For SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.0 (included with Windows 3.1), add the following
   line to the CONFIG.SYS file.

   device=c:\windows\smartdrv.exe /double_buffer+

(NOTE: SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.0 is included with Microsoft Windows version 3.1.
Earlier versions of SMARTDrive have the filename SMARTDRV.SYS.)

The following DRIVPARM statements are valid for MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later:

      drivparm=/d:0 /f:n  <-see your MS-DOS manual for the value of "n">
      drivparm=/d:1 /f:n  <-see your MS-DOS manual for the value of "n">
