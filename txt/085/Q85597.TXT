SUMMARY
=======

The "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit: Setup Toolkit for Windows,"
distributed with the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) version
3.1, can create a setup script that is compatible with Windows 3.0.

In addition to the six Microsoft setup dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), the data
decompression library (LZEXPAND.DLL) and the file installation library (VER.DLL)
must be included with the distribution for the setup script to function
properly.

Because LZEXPAND and VER are compatible only with protected mode, these files
cannot be used under real mode Windows version 3.0.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
