-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following information applies to Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1
running with a Logitech mouse plugged into a PS/2 style port.

Mouse driver version 6.1 is currently being shipped with the Trackman
Portable mouse. This software includes a .CPL file that installs into
the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. A new icon appears in Control Panel
using the .CPL file. This Logitech utility (activated by choosing the
Logitech mouse icon) has the ability to change the directional
settings for the mouse. For example, you can reverse the up/down
direction of the mouse, so that pulling the mouse toward you causes
the mouse pointer to move up instead of down.

These settings are only saved for the active Windows session, and are
lost when you exit Windows. Manually exiting the WIN.INI file and
adding "orientation=south" to the [Trackman] section does NOT correct
the problem.

Logitech has confirmed this to be a problem with their .CPL file.

The Logitech products included here are manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
