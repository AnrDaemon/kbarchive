SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Windows version 3.1 Hewlett-Packard (HP) ThinkJet (2225 C-D)
printer driver version 1.0 is missing the paper size Euro FanFold (250 x 340
mm), which is a common size for the HP ThinkJet printer. As a result you may
notice your top and bottom margins rolling or creeping.

If you notice the top and bottom margins rolling or creeping, you may need to
adjust the following dip switch. The ThinkJet has eight switches from left to
right.

   Switch 4 UP     12-inch paper
 
   Switch 4 DOWN   11-inch paper

STATUS
======

researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
