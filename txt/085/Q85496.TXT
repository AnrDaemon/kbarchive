======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft C/C++ compiler for MS-DOS 
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running a Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) application developed with
Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 or Visual C++ for Windows may cause one of the
following error messages to be displayed:

   Assertion failed - <unknown application>:File winapp.cpp, Line 258

-or-

   Assertion failed - <unknown application>:File appcore.cpp, Line 602


Running a MFC application developed with Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 1.0
may cause the following error message to be displayed:

   Assertion failed - <unknown application>:File appcore.cpp, Line 559

Running a MFC application developed with Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 2.x,
may cause the following error message to be displayed:

   Assertion failed - <unknown application>:File winmain.cpp, Line 40

Running a MFC application developed with Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 4.0,
may cause the following error message to be displayed:

   Debug Assertion Failed!

   Program: <program_name>
   File: winmain.cpp
   Line: 34

NOTE: In Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0 and above, the assertion will
be followed by an Application Error.

CAUSE
=====

The assertion that fails is the check to see whether an application object
exists. Without the application object, the program cannot run.

RESOLUTION
==========

Define an object of a class derived from the CWinApp class.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An example of this error may be seen by commenting out the file scoped statement
of any MFC application that defines the CWinApp-derived object. This statement
will look similar to the following:

      CMyWinApp  MyWinApp;

where CMyWinApp is defined as follows:

      class CMyWinApp : public CWinApp
      {
         //...
      };

For an example MFC application, see the HELLOAPP sample program included with any
of the Microsoft products listed above.


Chapter 3 of the "Microsoft C Class Libraries User's Guide," provided with
Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0, and chapter 1 of the "Programming with MFC:
Overview," included in the Visual C++ Books Online, contain additional
information on CWinApp and on the fundamentals of using the Microsoft Foundation
Classes to build an application for Windows.
