The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are running Microsoft Windows in 386 enhanced mode and losing the
mouse pointer when switching to or from MS-DOS-based applications, then
change Device Contention for the communications port to Never Warn.

Steps to Change Device Contention
---------------------------------

1. Run Control Panel.

2. Choose the 386 Enhanced icon.

3. Highlight the COM port being used for the mouse (COM1 or COM2) and select
   Never Warn.

This is equivalent to adding the line Com1AutoAssign=0 to the
SYSTEM.INI file's [386enh] section.

For more information on this setting, refer to page 247 of the "Microsoft
Windows User's Guide," or page 195 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit"
guide.
