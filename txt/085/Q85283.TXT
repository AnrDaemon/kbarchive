SUMMARY
=======

BLOCKS is a file in the Microsoft Download Center that demonstrates using the
Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC). The user of the BLOCKS sample can create
rectangle, ellipse, and rounded rectangle graphical objects. Once the objects
are created, the mouse can be used to manipulate the objects by changing their
size or position on the screen. The user can save to a disk file the state of
objects in the BLOCKS window for use in another session.

The BLOCKS sample illustrates the structure of an MFC application. It
demonstrates the following:

 - Deriving a class from the CObject class

 - Using virtual functions with user-defined classes

 - Maintaining a list of classes

 - Creating static data and static member functions in a class

 - Using the serialization feature of the CObject class to save classes to and
   read classes from a disk file

BLOCKS demonstrates the following MFC classes: CArchive, CBrush, CClientDC, CDC,
CFile, CFrameWnd, CPaintDC, CPen, CPoint, CRect, and CWinApp.
