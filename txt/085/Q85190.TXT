SUMMARY
=======

When using Microsoft Windows SETUP /H with a SETUP.SHH file (or *.SHH file), a
file called WINMATIC.SHH is created in the user's directory. This file is a copy
of the SETUP.SHH file that was used during the installation.

To confirm what options were used to set up Windows, you can examine the entries
in this file. This file is not necessary for Windows to run, so it can be
deleted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows Automated Setup option (also called Batch Mode Setup), allows you to
write a script file for Setup (an example called SETUP.SHH comes with Windows
3.1), which automates the Setup and requires little user input. You can
configure Setup to automatically install certain printers, applications,
hardware options, and other options. The following is an example of the command
line:

      SETUP /H X:\NETWIN\SETUP.SHH /N

Note: SETUP.SHH is an example; you can use any acceptable filename with an
extension of .SHH.

For more information on this feature, refer to pages 75-82 of the "Microsoft
Windows Resource Kit" guide for operating system version 3.1.
