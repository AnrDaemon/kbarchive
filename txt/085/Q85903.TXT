The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you start Microsoft CodeView under Windows 3.0 in a 386 enhanced mode
MS-DOS session, the following error message is displayed:

   You have attempted to run a protected-mode application under 386 enhanced
   mode. To run the application, exit and run Windows using either the WIN /s or
   the WIN /r command.

However, using WIN with the /s or /r option is unnecessary. To avoid the error
message, start CodeView with the /e option, as follows, to tell CodeView that
expanded memory is available:

   cv /e

This information applies to Microsoft CodeView versions 2.35, 3.0, 3.1, 3.11, and
3.14 for MS-DOS, and to Windows version 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If, after you receive the error message, you return to the MS-DOS session and
wait a few seconds, CodeView may start. To avoid the error message, start
CodeView as follows with the expanded memory (/E) option (where
<FILENAME.EXE> is the name of the program you want to open):

   cv /e <filename.exe>

To increase the size of programs that can be loaded into CodeView in conjunction
with the /e switch, create a PIF (program information file) for CodeView, and
specify -1 for the expanded memory KB limit. This will instruct Windows to give
the program all the EMS that it needs.

CodeView will run without the above error message in a Windows 3.0 MS-DOS session
in standard mode with the WIN /S option.
