The above error message(s) may occur if the subdirectory for CorelDRAW! has been
moved or if the WIN.INI file is missing the correct CorelDRAW! information. To
eliminate these errors, place the correct settings in the WIN.INI file.

During the installation process, CorelDRAW! versions 2.0 and 2.01L create an
entry in the WIN.INI file that tells the system where to look for necessary
files (for example, CorelDRAW! font files) as follows:

      [CorelDraw]
      dir=C:\CORELDRW

Also, the following line is added to the [Extensions] section

        cdr=C:\CORELDRW\coreldrw.exe ^.cdr

where \CORELDRW is the default directory on drive C.
