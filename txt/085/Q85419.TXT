28. Above Board 286 and Above Board Plus Installation Programs

----------------------------------------------------

CAUTION: The Intel Above Board installation program that shipped before May 1989
tests extended memory in a way that can corrupt extended memory.

Before using an Above Board installation program prior to May 1989, make sure you
haven't loaded software such as SMARTDrive or RAMDrive that uses extended
memory. After the Above Board has been installed, other software using extended
memory is unaffected.

2. Amload:

If you can't use the Apricot Computer Amload program, use the following LOADFIX
command:

   " LOADFIX amload.exe " (without the quotation marks)

For information about the LOADFIX command, see the section "You receive the
'Packed file corrupt' message" in Chapter 4 of Microsoft MS-DOS Getting
Started.

3. AutoCAD release 10:

To run AutoCAD release 10 for MS-DOS, contact Autodesk for a patch file. No patch
is needed for AutoCAD386.

4. AUTORUN.EXE:

If you can't use Mountain Network Solutions AUTORUN.EXE, a tape-drive backup
program, contact your vendor for an upgrade.

5. CodeView:

CAUTION: Using versions 3.0 to 3.13 of the CodeView CV.EXE file may cause data
loss if your system has a 80386 memory manager (such as EMM386.EXE) and device
drivers or programs that use extended memory. To determine which version you
have, type CV.EXE at the command prompt.

To start CodeView versions 3.0 to 3.13 safely, use the CV.COM file included with
MS-DOS 5.0, and HIMEM.SYS version 2.77 or later.

To use the CV.COM file included with MS-DOS 5.0, copy it from Setup Disk 2
(5.25-inch disks) or Disk 3 (3.5-inch disks). Copy it to the directory that
contains your CV.EXE file.

This problem has been fixed in CodeView version 3.14. Call Microsoft C Support to
get this version.

6. Easel 6.0:

Interactive Images Easel 6.0 is incompatible with the DOS=HIGH and EMM386
commands. Contact your vendor for an update.

7. Fastback:

If you have a version of Fifth Generation Systems Fastback earlier than 3.0, you
must use the LOADFIX command before running Fastback or the Fastback
installation program. Type the following:

   " LOADFIX FB.EXE " (without the quotation marks)

   or

   " LOADFIX FBINSTAL.EXE " (without the quotation marks)

For information about the LOADFIX command, see the section "You receive the
'Packed file corrupt' message" in Chapter 4 of Microsoft MS-DOS Getting
Started.

8. GeoWorks:

If you have a version of GeoWorks (PC/GEOS) earlier than 1.2, use the SETVER
command to report version number 4.01 to the GEOS.EXE file. Type the following:

   " SETVER GEOS.EXE 4.01 " (without the quotation marks)

Do not run the installation program for GeoWorks Ensemble when MS-DOS Shell Task
Swapper is active.

Use the Exclusive Tasking option when running GeoWorks Ensemble with Windows.

9. LINK.EXE: Unexpected Error Messages:

If you get unexpected error messages while linking programs, make sure you don't
have an old version of LINK.EXE in your DOS directory or path.

LINK.EXE is not supplied with MS-DOS 5.0.

10. Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.0:

For information about Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.0, see the section "Lotus 1-2-3
version 3.1 won't start" in Chapter 4 of Microsoft MS-DOS Getting Started. This
information also applies to Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.0.

11. Manifest:

Versions 1.01 and later of Quarterdeck Manifest are compatible with MS-DOS 5.0.
If you have a version earlier than 1.01, contact your vendor for an upgrade.

12. Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions:

Use MSCDEX.EXE version 2.20 or later with MS-DOS 5.0. If you have an earlier
version, contact your vendor for an upgrade.

13. Paintbrush 2.0:

If you have an EGA monitor and want to run Microsoft or ZSoft Paintbrush 2.0, you
must remove the DEVICE=EGA.SYS command from your CONFIG.SYS file. After removing
the command, you may have difficulty with screen swapping when using Task
Swapper in MS-DOS Shell.

14. Paradox 3.5:

For information about Paradox version 3.5, see the section "Lotus 1-2-3 version
3.1 won't start" in Chapter 4 of Microsoft MS-DOS Getting Started. This
information also applies to Paradox 3.5.

15. PC-Kwik Disk Accelerator:

Do not load versions of Multisoft PC-Kwik Disk Accelerator earlier than 2.0 into
the upper memory area.

16. PeachTree Complete III Single-User Version:

If you are using the single-user version of PeachTree Complete III (batch 01
through batch 13), contact PeachTree for an update.

There is no compatibility problem with the network version.

17. Pklite:

Do not use Pklite to pack device drivers.

If you have a PC-Kwik cache on your system, and you can't run a packed program,
do one of the following:

   * Use the LOADFIX command to start the program.
   * Run MS-DOS 5.0 in conventional memory.
   * Run a version of the program that was not packed with Pklite.
   * Disable asynchronous reads on the PC-Kwik cache.

For information about the LOADFIX command, see the section "You receive the
'Packed file corrupt' message" in Chapter 4 of Microsoft MS-DOS Getting
Started.

18. ProKey Plus:

If you have problems using a version of RoseSoft ProKey Plus earlier than 5.0,
contact your vendor for an upgrade.

ProKey Plus is incompatible with MS-DOS Editor and QBasic.

19. Sidekick 2.0:

If you are running MS-DOS 5.0 in the high memory area, use the following LOADFIX
command to start Borland Sidekick 2.0:

   " LOADFIX sk2.exe " (without the quotation marks)

For information about the LOADFIX command, see the section "You receive the
'Packed file corrupt' message" in Chapter 4 of Microsoft MS-DOS Getting
Started.

20. Soft-ICE:

When using Nu-Mega Soft-ICE, load it before loading other drivers. Otherwise, you
may lose data stored in extended memory by drivers such as SMARTDrive.

21. Software Carousel:

Software Carousel 5.01 is compatible with MS-DOS 5.0. If you have an earlier
version, contact SoftLogic Solutions for an update.

If you installed HIMEMSLS.SYS, remove the DEVICE=HIMEMSLS.SYS command from your
CONFIG.SYS after running MS-DOS 5.0 Setup.

To use DOSKEY, load it after you load Software Carousel into memory.

22. Task Swapper and Asynchronous I/O:

Some programs that perform asynchronous communications are incompatible with
MS-DOS Shell Task Swapper. Terminal- emulation software (such as SmartCom and
Procomm Plus) and server/client software (such as Laplink and Blast) are
asynchronous communications programs. If you can't use an asynchronous program
with Task Swapper, contact your vendor for more information, or disable Task
Swapper.

23. Turbo Debugger 386:

The Borland Turbo Debugger 386 is configuration-dependent and must be reinstalled
after you upgrade to MS-DOS 5.0.

24. Ventura Publisher:

If you can't start Ventura Publisher, make sure your Ventura Publisher directory
is within the first 70 characters of the PATH command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file.

25. WordPerfect WPINFO.EXE 5.1:

Some versions of the WPINFO.EXE file included with WordPerfect 5.1 are
incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0. Contact your vendor for more information.

26. WordPerfect Office 3.0:

Some versions of WordPerfect Office 3.0 are incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0. Contact
your vendor for more information.

27. XTreeNet:

To use XTreeNet with MS-DOS Shell Task Swapper, select the Prevent Program Switch
option in the MS-DOS Shell Advanced dialog box. For more information about
specifying advanced properties, see Chapter 8 of the Microsoft MS-DOS User's
Guide and Reference.
