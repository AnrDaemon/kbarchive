SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows Resource Kit (WRK) for Windows version 3.1 provides a
troubleshooting section that refers to Multimedia Extensions 1.0 that can be
added to Microsoft Windows 3.0. You should not confuse this with the multimedia
capabilities of Windows version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On page 434 of the version 3.1 WRK, under the section titled "Troubleshooting
Multimedia," the text refers to Multimedia Extensions 1.0 for Windows 3.0, not
the multimedia features of Windows 3.1.

Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions 1.0 will add the following icons to the
Control Panel: Display, Drivers, Joystick, MIDI Mapper, and Screen Saver. If you
upgrade this installation to Microsoft Windows 3.1, the Display, Joystick, and
Screen Saver icons will be removed.

Additional query words: 3.1 3.11 3.10
