 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Before the Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax can spool incoming fax items to the
printer, the DISPLAY.EXE program must be run from the same directory from which
the fax gateway will be run.

Use DISPLAY.EXE to create a printer driver for the fax gateway. Until a printer
driver is created, the fax gateway cannot spool items to the printer.

If the DISPLAY.EXE program is run from another directory, copy the files
DISPLAY.CFG and SNAPSHOT.DRV to the directory where the FAXGTW.EXE program will
be run.
