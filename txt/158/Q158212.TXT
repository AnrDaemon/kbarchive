TITLE   :SNA Server Unable to Reconnect to Distributed Link Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 allows a SNA Server to communicate through an SNA
Server link service residing on a different server (referred to as the
Distributed Link Service feature). However, SNA Server will be unable to reopen
a connection through the "distributed" link service under the following
conditions:

 - If the LAN session between the SNA Server and the "remoted" link service is
   lost.

 - If the computer running SNA Server is powered off without gracefully shutting
   down the server.


CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server link service interface (SNALINK.DLL) was not passing "lost
locality" messages to the link service. This caused the link service to fail to
end, and to fail to accept a new connection from an SNA Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
2.11 Service Pack 1.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
