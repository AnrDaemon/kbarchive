PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to modify a Microsoft Mail postoffice connection from the
Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program (Admin.exe), you may receive the
following stop error message:

   The postoffice NETWORK/PO could not be modified because either the MS Mail
   Connector server is unavailable or there is insufficient memory available to
   perform this operation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The registry entry for the postoffice is missing. Restore the registry key from
backup or manually restore the registry value for the postoffice in question
using the Registry Editor.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

      SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/MSExchangeMSMI/Parameters/Admin

3. Select this key to highlight it, click Edit, and click Add Value.

4. Create the registry value with the following parameters:

      Value Name: NETWORK/PO
      Data Type: REG_SZ
      String: \\Machine_name\Share /Z

NOTE: For "NETWORK/PO" use the Network and Postoffice name for the postoffice in
question. This data will be displayed in the Microsoft Mail Connector
properties' Connections tab. For the String data, the example above is for
Windows NT Server and LanManager compatible networks. For NetWare networks the
path would be in the following format:

   \\Server_name\Volume\Path_to_Maildata


For more information on configuring the Microsoft Mail Connector for Microsoft
Exchange Server refer to the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide,
Chapter 14. This information is also available on Books Online included with
Microsoft Exchange Server.
