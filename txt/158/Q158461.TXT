The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The NetQue and NetJet cards from Emulex Network Technology support the Line
Printer Daemon (LPD) print server for the Windows NT Line Printer Remote (LPR)
Print Monitor. The default printer name of the NetQue and NetJex card is either
TEXT, for ASCII files, or PASSTHRU, for formatted text. These names are case
sensitive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The LPR port monitor enables Windows NT to print through TCP/IP to printers with
built-in network cards that support TCP/IP network and LPD print server. When
you install the LPR port monitor, you will be asked to specify the IP address of
the LPD print server and printer name (or print queue name) on that LPD.

When the NetQue or NetJet card is used, you should type:

 - The IP address of the card in the "Name or address of server providing lpr"
   field

 - PASSTHRU for formatted text (PCL, POSTSCRIPT) and TEXT for ASCII files in the
   "Name of printer or print queue on that server" field. PASSTHRU works for
   most cases.

NOTE: These names must typed in capital letters, regardless of how they appear on
screen.
If you specify a printer name other than PASSTHRU or TEXT, printing to the
printer will fail and the following application event will appear in Event
Viewer:

   Event ID: 2004
   Description: Printer on <printer name> is rejecting your request. Will
   retry until it accepts the request or the job is canceled by the user.

The NetQue/NetJet product discussed here is manufactured by Emulex Network
Technology, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding these products performance or reliability.
