TITLE   :XCON: Only a Few Messages Delivered over X.400 Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs when you use the Chinese version of Windows NT 3.51. An
X.400 connector over TP4 stack is used to connect to Microsoft Exchange Server
in a different site, and the Use Expedited Data check box on the X.400 connector
Stack property page is selected. The message transfer agent (MTA) only delivers
one to four mail messages to the remote site and then stops. Restarting the MTA
does not resolve the problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

Clear the Use Expedited Data check box on Stack property page.
