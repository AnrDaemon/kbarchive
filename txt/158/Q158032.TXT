SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to troubleshoot GEX display issues you may encounter
if your system is not configured correctly.

DISPLAY TROUBLESHOOTING
-----------------------

High-Color Mode:

GEX is optimized for high-color (16-bit) mode. If your video card is capable of
running in high-color (16-bit) mode, change your display mode to high color.

To change your display mode to high color:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Display icon.

3. Click the Settings tab.

4. Under Color Palette, click High Color (16-Bit).

If you're not sure that your video card supports high color, contact your video
card manufacturer.

3D Accelerated Graphics Cards:

 - GEX does not use enhanced features of 3D accelerated graphics cards. Many of
   these cards require drivers that are still in a preproduction state, and you
   may experience problems using such drivers. For updated drivers, contact your
   hardware manufacturer.

 - Your video card may not be DirectX-compatible. If you're not sure that your
   video card is DirectX-compatible, contact your video card manufacturer. Newer
   versions of DirectX offer better video card support. The latest version of
   DirectX is available at the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/directx

   For more information about how to obtain the latest version of DirectX, please
   see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

GEX Game Graphics:

 - If you are having trouble seeing all of the menu items on your screen, you
   should change your Windows 95 font size to a smaller setting.

   To change your Windows 95 font size:

   1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

   2. Double-click the Display icon.

   3. Click the Appearance tab.

   4. On the Item list, click Menu.

   5. Change the font size by clicking the Size box arrow.

 - If you purchased your video card before the release of Microsoft Windows 95,
   you should install the latest video drivers. For the current video drivers,
   contact your hardware manufacturer.
