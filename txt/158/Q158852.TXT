TITLE   :XCLN: Client Cannot Read Project 4.0 Files Sent Through Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send Project 4.0 Macintosh files using Microsoft Exchange Server, the
file creator and type are reset to null, making the file unreadable.

When you try to open the Project 4.0 attachment, the following error message
appears:

   The document <document name> could not be opened, because the
   application program that created it could not be found. Could not find a
   translation extension with appropriate translators.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Use a file server (such as Windows NT File Services for Macintosh) to share
   the file and create a Macintosh-accessible volume.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh
client version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0
U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
