The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0

 - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When your project is loaded and you try to browse a symbol inside the Visual C++
IDE, you receive the following error message:

   No Browse Information is available

or, in earlier versions of Visual C++:

   Browse information is not available for this project

CAUSE
=====

The project does not have the right settings switched on to create a browser
(BSC) file.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Visual C++ .NET, you must click to select a single project option to create
the BSC file:

1. In the Solution Explorer window, right-click the project in question (note
   that solutions can contain more than one project), and then click Properties.

2. In the Property Pages dialog box, click to select the General section.

3. Locate the Build Browser Information property in the General section, and
   then change the setting from No to Yes.

4. Rebuild your project to create the BSC file.

In earlier versions of Visual C++, you must click to select two check boxes in
the build settings:

1. On the main menu, select Build/Settings.

2. Select the C/C++ tab. Select the Generate browse info box. This tells the
   compiler to generate an intermediate SBR file for each source file.

3. Select the Browse Info tab. Select the Build browse info file box. This
   invokes the BSCMAKE utility when a project is built to generate a BSC file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
