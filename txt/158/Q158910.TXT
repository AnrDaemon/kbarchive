SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to ensure multimedia components are installed using
the Msbatch.inf file for batch installations of Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this article.
Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you proceed.

When you are installing Windows 95 using the Msbatch.inf file, specifying the
multimedia components might not install all of the components because the
multimedia hardware was not detected. Specifically, Audio Compression, Sample
Sounds, Volume Control, Sound Recorder, and other components may be missing. To
work around this problem, use the /p c- Setup switch.

When you run Setup, specifying the /p c- switch will disable safe class detection
and force detection of the multimedia hardware.

For example:

   Setup.exe /p c- (this disables safe class detection)

   Setup.exe (this uses safe class detection)

Safe class detection may not recognize all the multimedia hardware on a computer.
Disabling safe class detection helps ensure that the proper hardware is detected
for the multimedia components and that these components are installed.
