SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print to a local port from WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS, the print
job may not print until you exit the application. However, when you print to a
network port, the print job is successful.

CAUSE
=====

In WordPerfect, the Print to Hardware Port option is disabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following steps to enable this option in WordPerfect:

1. Press SHIFT+F7.

2. Press S for Select Printer.

3. With your current printer selected, press 3 for Edit.

4. Press 7 for Print to Hardware Port.

If this option is set to No, change it to Yes by pressing 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Print to Hardware Port option is used to help WordPerfect communicate with
nonstandard printer ports. This option may not work with all printer ports. It
may also be used to change the interrupt request level (IRQ) or base address of
the printer port.
