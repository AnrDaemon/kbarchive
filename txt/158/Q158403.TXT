TITLE   :PRB: "No Records Found" Error While Converting a Report in VFP
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following problem arises when a user attempts to convert a Visual FoxPro 3.0
for Mactintosh report to Visual FoxPro 3.0b Windows. When the MODIFY REPORT
<report file name> is entered in the Command window and the user is
attempting to open a Visual FoxPro 3.0 for Mactintosh report, the user is
prompted with the following dialog box:

   Do you want to convert the report <report name> to Visual FoxPro 3.0
   format?

   Continue Cancel Help

After the user clicks Continue, the conversion appears to begin. However, the
message "No Records for current platform!" appears.

CAUSE
=====

Since Visual FoxPro 3.0 for the Macintosh was developed after Visual FoxPro 3.0b
for Windows, it contains a later version of the Convert.app file. When a report
from another platform is opened (that is, Macintosh), the Visual FoxPro system
memory variable _CONVERTER is invoked and it calls Convert.app.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, copy the Convert.app file from the Visual FoxPro for
Macintosh folder to the Visual FoxPro for Windows folder.
