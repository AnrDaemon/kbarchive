-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run the command CHKDSK /F /R from the command line, Windows NT asks if
you want to schedule CHKDSK to run the next time the system is restarted. This
article describes how, in the event you choose YES, you can subsequently prevent
CHKDSK from running the next time you start the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To stop the execution of CHKDSK /F /R, you must edit the registry using Registry
Editor.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To stop the execution of CHKDSK /F /R, take the following steps:

1. Run the Registry Editor(Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

   \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager

3. Change the BootExecute entry from:

   autocheck autochk * /r\DosDevice\C:

   To:

   autocheck autochk *

If you have scheduled CHKDSK for multiple volumes, there will be an autocheck
entry for each volume. Delete the string from the BootExecute registry value for
each volume you do not want checked.

This procedure will reset the default string, and CHKDSK /F /R will not run on
reset.

Additional query words: CHKDSK /F /R AUTOCHECK
