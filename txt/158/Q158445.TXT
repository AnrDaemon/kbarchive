SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to load the Remote Control agent on a client computer running
Windows 95, the Remote Control agent fails with the following error:

   unable to get workstation name: use Lana 0

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem generally occurs on Windows 95 clients that have multiple protocols
loaded, and no protocol is selected as the default. Select the protocol desired
for Remote Control and set it as the default. You must restart the computer for
the change to take effect. After that, the Remote Control agent should perform
normally.
