SUMMARY
=======

Certain characters are converted when you pass them into the Internet Database
Connector (IDC) mechanism (Httpodbc.dll).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Internet Database Connector makes the following conversions on characters
when it passes from an HTML form into the IDC file.

The following can cause a problem when you try to pass portions of a Microsoft
SQL Server statement into an IDC file. It is not recommended to pass entire
portions of a SQL statement in via parameters. Due to malicious users
potentially being able to specify rogue SQL parameters alter intended
application usage.

 - Double all single quotes to prevent SQL quoting problem.

 - Remove escaped '\n's.

 - Replace all '&' parameter delimiters with real '\n'.
