The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you have installed Novell NetWare Client v3.5b for Windows NT and are using
the Autoreconnect feature (installed by default), you will not be able to
add/remove network components or administer services because the service
database states it is locked:

   STOP: The service database is locked.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To unlock the services database, you must disable the NetwareAutoreconnect
services by using Regedt32 to modify the Windows NT registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start REGEDT32.

2. Find the following key:

   \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\ 
   NetWareAutoReconnect

3. After selecting the NetWareAutoReconnect key, change the value of the Start
   entry by double-clicking the Start:REG_DWORD:0x2 and changing the value from
   0x2 to 0x4 (automatic to disabled).

4. Exit Regedt32. Restart Windows NT.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

Switch to the Microsoft Gateway Services or Client Services for NetWare
Redirector.

-or-

Do not use the Autoreconnect service. Keep it disabled if you are going to use
the Novell Requester.
