TITLE   :Printer Disappears After Upgrading to Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade from Windows NT 3.51 to Windows NT 4.0, your printer may no
longer exist.

CAUSE
=====

When you upgrade, the printer is not re-created if Setup cannot locate a
suitable printer driver with which to upgrade the current printer driver. This
behavior can occur if you are using a third-party printer driver or if the
Windows NT 3.51 printer driver name does not match the Windows NT 4.0 printer
driver name.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent the Windows NT printer from being deleted during the upgrade, change
the Windows NT 3.51 printer to use a driver that Windows NT 4.0 supports. In
Windows NT 3.51 Print Manager, select the Properties of the printer and then
select a printer driver that is supported in Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The printer driver name mismatch is usually caused by the use of a driver
supplied by the printer manufacturer.
