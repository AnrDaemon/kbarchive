SYMPTOMS
========

When you are compressing a write-protected disk in a removable media drive with
DriveSpace, you may receive a message stating that there are errors on the disk.
This message is likely to occur with large-capacity removable media when the
compress operation is approximately 16 percent complete, and with floppy disks
when the compress operation is approximately 25 percent complete.

CAUSE
=====

DriveSpace in OEM Service Release 2 and DriveSpace 3 in Microsoft Plus! perform
read and write testing.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the write protection on the disk and then run the DriveSpace operation
again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run ScanDisk with OEM Service Release 2 or Microsoft Plus!, ScanDisk
may report that the disk is write-protected when the operation is approximately
16 percent complete with large removable media or when the operation is
approximately 25 percent complete with floppy disks.

Windows 95 DriveSpace performs read testing but does not perform write testing.
