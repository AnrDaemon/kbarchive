SUMMARY
=======

When you try to run an emergency repair, and you do not have an emergency repair
disk, the emergency repair fails when you use the files located in the
\%Systemroot%\Repair folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Windows NT system files are on a file allocation table (FAT) partition,
or a partition formatted with MS-DOS, and you cannot start Windows NT, start to
MS-DOS by either selecting MS-DOS from the menu or from an MS-DOS startup floppy
disk. Copy the contents of the \%Systemroot%\Repair folder to the root of a
Windows NT formatted floppy disk.

NOTE: If creating an Emergency Repair disk booted via DOS from a FAT partitioin
then ensure that the System, Hidden, and Read-Only file attributes are removed
from the Setup.log file in the %SYSTEMROOT/REPAIR folder. This ensures that the
Setup.log file is copied onto the diskette.

If the Windows NT system files are on an NTFS file system partition, install
another copy of Windows NT into a separate and unique directory. Start Windows
NT from this install. Copy the contents of the \%Systemroot%\Repair folder to
the root of a Windows NT formatted floppy disk. Alternately, if you have a
backup tape from the failed system, you can restore the %Systemroot%\Repair
folder and copy the restored files to the root of the formatted floppy disk.

To create a Windows NT formatted floppy disk on Windows NT 3.51, double- click on
the File Manager icon, place a floppy disk in the floppy disk drive, click the
Disk menu, and click Format Disk. The Format Disk dialog appears. Select the
drive and capacity, and then click OK.

To format a floppy disk, from the Desktop, double-click My Computer. Place a
floppy disk in the floppy disk drive. Right-click the disk drive icon. Click
Format, and then click OK.

You can now run the repair process. Select "Emergency Repair Disk," and insert
the disk you just created.
