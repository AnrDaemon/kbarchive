TITLE   :Cannot Choose Icons in Executable File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to change the icon associated with an executable file that
contains icons of its own, you may be presented with a selection of icons found
in the default Windows\system\shell32.dll file.

Attempts to manually enter the path to the executable file may generate the
following error message:

   The file <filename> contains no icons.

CAUSE
=====

A space in the path to the file prevents the file's use as a source for icons.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reinstall the program to a new folder that does not include spaces in the path.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
