TITLE   :WD97: Backslash, Semicolon Dropped from XE Field
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfield

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create an index entry ({XE}) field that contains a backslash (\)
followed by a semicolon (;) and then convert the document to Word 6.0, Word 95,
or Rich Text Format (RTF), the backslash and the semicolon are dropped from the
{XE} field. Consequently, when you update your index, the result is incorrect.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, install the Word 97 converter on the computer where
you have Word 6.0 or 7.0. This allows you to open Word 97 documents in Word 6.0
or 7.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The backslash in the field indicates to Word that the semicolon is to appear in
the index and that it does not indicate the end of the material. If the
backslash is not present, the text that appears in the index ends with the
semicolon.
