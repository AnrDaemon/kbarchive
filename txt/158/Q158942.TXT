PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT may seem to stop responding (hang) or may display a stop screen after
being left idle.


CAUSE
=====

Power Management is enabled on the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Most computers allow you to disable Power Management features using the BIOS
Setup tool. The BIOS Setup tool can usually be started by pressing certain keys
after turning the computer on. Consult your computer's documentation or
manufacturer for specific instructions for your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 should not be used with BIOS Power Management features enabled.
Power Management works by shutting down portions of the computer hardware during
periods of low or no use.

Windows NT 4.0 requires direct access to the hardware on a continual basis and is
not currently designed to handle the delays associated with "powering up" of
various hardware devices after periods of inactivity.
