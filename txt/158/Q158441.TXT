TITLE   :Cannot Connect to Dial-Up Networking Server with Local User List
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:mspwsw95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Personal Web Server versions 1.0, 1.0a for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure Personal Web Server to use a local user list for security,
users may not be able to connect to the Dial-Up Networking server.

CAUSE
=====

When a local user list is used for security with Personal Web Server, the
Dial-Up Networking server may be disabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use both Personal Web Server and the Dial-Up Networking server, configure
Personal Web Server to use share-level or user-level security. To do this, use
the appropriate method:

Enable Share-Level Security
---------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Network.

3. On the Configuration tab, click File And Print Sharing.

4. Click the "I want to be able to give others access to my files" check box to
   select it.

5. Click the "I want to be able to allow others to print to my printer(s)" check
   box to select it.

6. Click the Access Control tab, and then click the Share-Level Access Control
   check box to select it.

7. Click OK until all dialog boxes are closed, and then restart your computer.

Enable User-Level Security
--------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Network.

3. On the Configuration tab, click File And Print Sharing.

4. Click the "I want to be able to give others access to my files" check box to
   select it.

5. Click the "I want to be able to allow others to print to my printer(s)" check
   box to select it.

6. Click the Access Control tab, and then click the User-Level Access Control
   check box to select it.

   NOTE: If you use user-level access control you must also type the name of the
   Windows NT domain, Windows NT-based computer, or Novell NetWare server used
   to provide pass-through validation in the "Obtain list of users and groups
   from" box.

7. Click OK until all dialog boxes are closed, and then restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the behavior described in this article occurs, you can choose from the list
of users entered in the local user list in Dial-Up Networking. However, when a
user dials into the Dial-Up Networking server, the server answers but does not
establish a connection.
