TITLE   :SMS: Configuration Command Line Ignores Specified Drive Letter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a shared application is configured to use a specific drive letter (for
example, drive F), and there is a configuration command line, the client will
not use that specific drive letter when it attempts to run the configuration
command line. Instead, it will use the next available drive letter to connect to
the package share.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
