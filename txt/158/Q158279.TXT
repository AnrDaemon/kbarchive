TITLE   :XCON: Dynamic RAS Connector Cannot Deliver Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs when using the Traditional Chinese version of Windows NT
Server 3.51. If you use a message transfer agent (MTA) with a name different
from the Microsoft Exchange Server name, when you send mail by a dynamic RAS
connector, the modem will dial out but no mail message is transferred. Warning
messages similar to the following appear in the application log:

   Event ID 289
   A connection to
   /O=MSFT/OU=RANDYYEH_CC1/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=CONNECTIONS/CN=RAS_CON_80 could
   not be opened. [MTA XFER-IN 19 26] (12)

   Event ID 1294
   An association with entity
   /O=MSFT/OU=RANDYYEH_CC1/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=CONNECTIONS/CN=RAS_CON_80 ended
   abnormally. [1 1 0 0 PLATFORM KERNEL 22 130] (10)

   Event ID 9316
   An RPC communications error occurred. No data was sent over the RPC
   connection. Locality table (LTAB) index: 7. Windows NT error: 9301. The MTA
   will attempt to recover the RPC connection. [BASE IL PIPE RAS 36 500] (12)

   Event ID 9311
   A RAS communications error has occurred for gateway
   /o=msft/ou=RANDYYEH_CC1/cn=Configuration/cn=Connections/cn=RAS_CON_80. RAS
   error code returned: 0, RAS Table index: 0. The MTA will attempt to recover
   the RAS connection. [BASE IL PIPE RAS 36 230] (12)

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the same MTA name as the Microsoft Exchange Server name.
