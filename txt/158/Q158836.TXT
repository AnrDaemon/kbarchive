PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::2,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use a Compaq USB camera with an OpenHCI (OHCI) USB host
controller, the camera may not be detected and may not work properly.

CAUSE
=====

The Compaq USB camera was designed and developed for use on the Intel Universal
HCI (UHCI) USB host controller. It is not supported on an OHCI controller.


MORE INFORMATION
================

OHCI host controllers employ optimization on the control endpoint zero, where
multiple transactions are submitted within a single frame. The UHCI host
controller sends only a single transaction per frame. The camera cannot respond
to a second transaction within a single frame.

The Compaq USB camera that is included with the Compaq Presario computer is
intended to be used only on that computer. For more information, contact Compaq.
