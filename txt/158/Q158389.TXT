SYMPTOMS
========

The screen may redraw slowly in the programs listed above when you are using
some ATI video drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem can be corrected by adding the following line to the [Display]
section of the System.ini file:

   STRETCHENGINE=0

MORE INFORMATION
================

Adding STRETCHENGINE=0 to the System.ini file changes the stretching of bitmaps
from the ATI video driver to Windows or the CPU. This solution may work for
other programs experiencing screen redraw problems using ATI video drivers.
