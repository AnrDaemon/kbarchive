PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta kbproof word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a document is formatted with multiple columns, revision marks may not
appear where you expect them to appear.

If You Specify Left Border Revision Marks
-----------------------------------------

When you compare one document to another and use revision bars to mark changes,
the revision bars are displayed on the left of each column but are printed along
the left edge of the page instead of along the left side of the edited column.

If You Specify Right Border Revision Marks
------------------------------------------

When you compare one document to another and use revision bars to mark changes,
the revision bars are displayed to the right of each column but are printed
along the right edge of the page instead of along the right side of the edited
column.

CAUSE
=====

Word prints all revision bars in the left, right, or outside page border,
depending on the option you have selected for Changed Lines. (On the Tools menu,
point to Track Changes, click Highlight Changes, and then click Options.) This
applies to both single and multi-column documents.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
This problem was corrected in Word 2000.





MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information about this problem, please see the following articles
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q176124 WD97: Revision Bars Display and Print in Wrong Location

In page layout view and print preview, the revision bars are shown beside the
lines that have changes, but within the columns of multi-column documents. If
you compare the printed version of a multi-column document with how it appears
in page layout or print preview, the location of the revision bars may be
different.

The revision bars will always be printed in the left border if you have selected
to print the revision bars in the outside border and have not selected
"Different odd and even" headers and footers (on the File menu, click Page
Setup, and click the Layout tab.) Try turning on this setting to see if the
problem is corrected.

Revision bars are used in conjunction with other revision marks (strikethrough
text, underlined text, colored text) to identify changed lines. Revision bars
are intended to draw the reader's eye to the general vertical position of the
changed lines.
