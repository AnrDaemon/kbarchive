TITLE   :WFW Err Msg: There Is Not Enough Memory Available
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11; winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error may occur when you attempt to connect from Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 to a network printer shared from an Windows NT server. After
clicking on the Windows NT server computer name in the Connect Network Printer
dialog box in Print Manager, you may see:

   STOP: There Is Not Enough Memory Available

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the printer's share name (the name that client computers
use to connect to Windows NT print shares) has a forward slash "/" in it. For
example, a printer shared as A1/LASER will produce this error.

RESOLUTION
==========

On the Windows NT Server where the printer shares were created, remove the "/"
(forward slash) from the printer's share name.

NOTE: A good rule of thumb for printer naming, especially when there are 16-bit
network clients like Windows for Workgroups, is to stick with 8.3 naming
conventions. For example, Printer9.pcl would be a good choice.
