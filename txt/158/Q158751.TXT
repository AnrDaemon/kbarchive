When you attempt to print on a computer running Windows NT Workstation the
following error message appears:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.

   Spoolss.exe

   Exception: access violation (0xc00000005), Address: <Hex address>

CAUSE
=====

These error conditions during printing may occur when third-party fax software
is installed either on an Windows NT print server computer or on a computer
running Windows NT Workstation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Some fax software programs modify the registry. It might become necessary to
remove the fax software in order to print. However, some programs do not clean
up the registry when they are removed. Check the registry to see if there are
entries added by a fax software program that might be causing one of the
previous errors.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and locate the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print

2. Look for any entries that might be related to a fax software program.

3. Delete these entries.

NOTE: Do NOT delete any of the subkeys of the Print key, such as Environments,
Forms, Monitors, Printers, and Providers.

NOTE: The symptoms described in this article may also be caused by third party
port monitor software, and it may be necessary to remove the port monitor from
the registry using the steps above.
