SUMMARY
=======

After restoring an optimized computer running Microsoft Exchange Server, it may
give false indications of a message transfer agent (MTA) failure if the registry
settings were not properly restored.

The typical scenario is as follows: the MTA will not start and the following stop
error message is generated:

   Could not start the Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent service on
   \\<server name>>.

   Error 2140: An internal Windows NT error.

In the event log the following error is found:

   An unexpected error has occurred which may cause the MTA to terminate. Error:
   Queue-Desc-Object (ID 1) not found {BASE MAIN BASE] (16).

If you run MTA check, the following error message appears:

   Error in Queue-Desc-Object (ID 1) initialization . Database contains serious
   errors and cannot be automatically repaired.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Restoring the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server or Windows NT Server
after optimization has occurred may result in its not properly pointing to the
location of the MTADATA subdirectory. Check the registry to ensure that the
registry key MTA database path is correct and points to the location of the log
files.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, check the following subkey:

      System\CurrentControSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters

3. If necessary, modify this key so that it points to the location of the log
   files.

4. Quit registry Editor.
