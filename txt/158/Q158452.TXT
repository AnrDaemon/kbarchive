SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the steps required to install and configure Windows 95 for
the Remoteboot service under Windows NT Server 4.0. Prior to performing any of
the steps outlined in this article, you must have properly installed the
Remoteboot service on Windows NT and have configured the remoteboot client for
MS-DOS. For more information, please see the following articles here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Article-ID: Q158454
   TITLE : How to Install Remoteboot on Windows NT 4.0

For this article, it is assumed that your system's Remoteboot service,
Server-Based Setup (SBS) installation directory, and machine directory reside in
a Windows NT 4.0 Server configured for remoteboot.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Requirements
------------

An SBS of Windows 95 requires 90 megabytes (MB) of available disk space on the
server, as well as an additional 2 MB for the Windows 95 client configuration
files and at least 10 MB for each Windows 95 machine directory. More disk space
is required if users install additional software.

The remoteboot client computer requires 8 MB of RAM, must use a 386DX or higher
processor, and must have a supported Remoteboot Network Card.

Installing SBS for Windows 95 Clients
-------------------------------------

The following procedures are taken from the Windows NT Server Networking Guide
Help file in the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit.

For more information about SBS servers, see the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource
Kit. The resource kit describes additional purposes, beyond remoteboot, that you
can use an SBS server for.

To install an SBS server for a Windows 95 client, you will need a Windows 95
installation compact disc (not to be confused with a floppy disk) and the
Windows 95 client computer. You must then complete the following steps:

1. On the server that will contain the SBS files, create a shared directory with
   90 MB of available disk space. The shared directory can have any name.

   NOTE: As you share the directory, assign read-only permission for regular
   users and full access for administrators. Use Server Manager to focus on the
   shared directory, and set read-only permission for the Users group and full
   permission for the Administrators group. In File Manager, on the Disk menu,
   click Share As (do NOT open the Security menu and click Permissions).

2. Install one regular Windows 95 client on the network or use an existing one.
   You will use this client to configure the SBS server.

3. Log on to the Windows 95 client using an account that has write access to the
   shared directory on the SBS server.

4. Put the Windows 95 compact disc in the client's CD-ROM drive. In Windows
   Explorer, switch to the Admin\Nettools\Netsetup directory.

   NOTE: Only the retail version of Windows 95 includes the Netsetup.exe utility.
   Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1, 2, and 2.5 do not include the Netsetup.exe
   utility.

5. Double-click the file Netsetup.exe.

   Note that you must run Netsetup.exe at a Windows 95 client. Errors will occur
   if you run this file on a computer running Windows NT.

6. In the Server-Based Setup dialog box, click Set Path, and specify the path to
   the SBS server. In specifying the path, you can type a drive letter for a
   mapped drive, a network name for a server (for example, \\server1\sharedir),
   or a network path to a specific directory (for example,
   \\server1\sharedir\rpl\win95). The button name becomes Change Path if a
   server was defined previously.

7. Click OK, then click Install.

8. Server-Based Setup now presents you with a series of dialog boxes asking you
   to select among various options. The boxes you see may include the following:

    - A dialog box for specifying an installation policy controlling how users
      can install Windows 95 from the server. If you support only remoteboot
      clients, click Server. If you support other SBS functions as well, click
      User's Choice. Do not click Local Hard Drive.

    - A dialog box for setting the source path for Windows 95 files. This is the
      path to the compact disc on the client.

    - A dialog box for indicating whether you want to create a default setup
      script. Specify that you do NOT want to create a default setup script.
      Setup scripts for Windows NT remoteboot installation require special
      settings.

    - A dialog box for providing a CD Key number for product identification.

    - A dialog box for directing Server-Based Setup to copy Windows 95 files to
      the SBS shared directory.

9. At the remoteboot server, insert the compact disc or floppy disk containing
   the Windows NT remoteboot for Windows 95 files. Change to the newly inserted
   disc or disk, then change to the Update\Win95 directory. To update the
   Windows 95 files for remotebooting, run Win95srv.bat. The following inputs
   illustrate this process:

      d:
      cd \clients\rpl\update\win95
      win95srv.bat <dest>

   where <dest> is the shared directory on the SBS server.

10. If you are updating from version 3.51 or earlier of the Remoteboot service,
   start the Remoteboot service at the remoteboot server (if it is not already
   started). Then run the program Rbootsrv.bat to update the remoteboot files
   and database for Windows 95 remotebooting. Thus, at the server's command
   prompt, you would type:

   d:
   cd \clients\rpl\update\win95
   rbootsrv.bat <SBS_path> <RPL_path> [\\servername]

   where:

    - <SBS_path> is the path to the installed SBS server's Windows 95
      files.

    - <RPL_path> is the path to the remoteboot directory.

    - \\servername is the name of the remoteboot server (you can omit this if
      you are typing at the remoteboot server).

11. At the remoteboot server, start Remoteboot Manager.

12. On the Configure menu, click Check Configurations to activate the new
   configurations.

Installing the First Windows 95 Client
--------------------------------------

Each remoteboot client has a machine directory. This directory contains
client-specific configuration information and data. Stored here are the
appropriate initialization and configuration files, the registry, desktop, start
menu directories, spool directories and the swap file and temp directories.
These machine directories can reside on any server on the network provided that
the server is running NetBEUI and IPX protocols and that there is ample disk
space available. You may want to spread the load of the machine directories
across servers.

1. On the server that will contain the machine directory, create a shared
   directory with at least 10 MB of space available per client. Additional space
   may be needed depending on the installed applications. The share directory
   can have any name and be located in any directory. One suggestion is that you
   create the directory under the WINNT\RPL and supply a name of Win95.mac.

   NOTE: The server for the machine directory must be in the same domain or
   workgroup as the SBS server.

   NOTE: The machine directories may not be subdirectories of the SBS directory.

2. Set the permissions for the share and directory (NTFS only). The group
   RPLUSERS and the group ADMINISTRATORS both need full control.

   NOTE: For added security (NTFS only), assign the permissions to a machine
   directory so that only the users who will use the client have full control of
   the machine directory for that remoteboot computer.

3. Boot the remoteboot client with DOS 6.2x.

4. Using the NET LOGON command, log on to the remoteboot client using an account
   that has read access to the SBS server and write access to the server with
   the machine directory share. Many users have found it easier to use the
   administrator account during the installation process for full access to all
   systems.

5. Using the NET USE command, map one drive to the SBS share and another to the
   machine directory share.

   NOTE: The drive letters used during this step cannot be changed and will be
   dedicated to the booting and operation of the Windows 95 remoteboot client.
   For example, in the following:

   net use F: \\NTSERVER\WIN95.SBS
   net use G: \\NTSERVER\WIN95.MAC

   drive F is mapped to the Windows 95 SBS and drive G is mapped to the Windows
   95 machine directory share. These drive letters cannot be changed or used for
   other shares since Windows 95 uses them during its operation.

6. Change to the drive letter mapped to the SBS share. In the above example,
   this is drive F.

7. Run the Windows 95 Setup program by typing:

   Setup /t:temppath

   where /t: is required and temppath is a path to a directory to store temporary
   files during the installation. This path could be G:\win.tmp. Note that the
   temp path is completely removed after completing the installation of Windows
   95.

   NOTE: You may want to use SETUP /T:TEMPPATH /IW /IS MSBATCH.INF. This bypasses
   licensing during setup and skips scandisk.

8. Setup will display the following dialog boxes:

    - Server-Based Setup dialog box. Select "Setup Windows to run from a network
      server."

    - Startup Method dialog box. Select "Start Windows from the network
      (remoteboot server)."

    - Machine Directory dialog box. Enter the drive letter and a directory to
      install the Windows 95. (The drive letter must be the same drive letter
      mapped for the computer's directory, and the directory name should reflect
      the configuration for the computer. For example, G:\DELL5166 might be used
      for a Dell Pentium 166. The directory is created during setup.)

    - Setup Options dialog box. Choose custom setup.

    - Analyzing Your Computer dialog box. Select "No, I want to modify the
      hardware list." (You should exclude as many hardware types and items from
      the auto-detection as possible. If during the auto-detection phase, the
      system fails, you should restart the setup process and exclude more items
      from the auto-detection phase.)

      NOTE: If your network adapter is using IRQ2 or IRQ3, this will conflict
      with the serial port detection and possibly cause the system to fail
      during Setup.

    - Select Components dialog box. Clear the checkbox for Communications if
      your remoteboot client doesn't have a modem.

    - Network Configuration dialog box. Select the appropriate network adapter
      and the desired protocols. If your network adapter is not displayed, you
      will have to add and configure your adapter.

      NOTE: If you add your network adapter, you must confirm the resource
      settings for the adapter by selecting OK. If you select Cancel, your
      Windows 95 remoteboot setup will fail to boot properly.

    - Identification dialog box. Make sure the workgroup name is the same as the
      domain or workgroup name of the SBS server and machine directory server.

When the Windows 95 setup program completes, reboot the client and either turn it
off or leave it at the prompt that asks you whether you want to boot from the
network or not.

9. At the remoteboot server, start the Remoteboot Manager.

10. Create a profile for the Windows 95 client. In the Configuration box, choose
   the Windows 95 configuration that corresponds to the client's network
   adapter type. The adapter type should be the same one used to do the DOS6.2x
   remoteboot.

11. Select the client's workstation record by double-clicking on it or selecting
   Properties from the Remoteboot menu, and assign the new Windows 95 profile.

12. Once the profile has been configured, you need to move the client- specific
   Windows 95 real-mode boot files from the client's machine directory to the
   Rpl\Rplfiles\ Profiles\<profile_name> directory on the remoteboot
   server. To do this, go to the remoteboot server (or a client with write
   access to the remoteboot server's Rpl directory), and run the
   Rpl\Bin\Win95clt.bat program by typing:

   cd <systemroot>\rpl\bin
   win95clt mach_directory \\rpl_server profile_name

   where:

    - mach_directory is the path to the client's machine directory.

    - \\rpl_server is the name of the remoteboot server.

    - profile_name is the name of the Windows 95 profile associated with the
      client.

   For example, you could type:

   cd \winnt\rpl\bin
   WIN95CLT G:\DELL5166 \\NTSERVER WIN95

   NOTE: You must have a drive letter explicitly pointing to the machine
   directory and cannot specify the UNC name for the location of the machine
   directory. If you try to use the UNC name, the remoteboot client will not be
   able to locate the full registry during the boot process.

   NOTE: If the machine directory is on the same computer as the Remoteboot
   service, then you can just type in the local path.

13. At the SBS server, edit the Machines.ini file in the SBS directory. Add the
   following lines for the new client.

      [Adapter ID]
      SysDatPath=G:\machine_dir
      G=\\mach_server\mach_share

   where:

    - Adapter ID is the network adapter ID (MAC address from manufacturer)
      specified in the remoteboot workstation record for this client.

    - G:\machine_dir is the location of the client's machine directory on a
      server.

   NOTE: The drive letter G: is the same drive letter assigned during the
   installation of Windows 95 for the machine directory.
   G=\\mach_server\mach_share assigns a drive letter to the shared directory
   where the machine directory resides. The G= should be the same drive letter
   assigned during the installation of the Windows 95 for the machine
   directory.

   Based on our previous examples, the Machine.ini for our client would contain
   the following:

         [12345AB67C89]
         SYSDATPATH=G:\DELL5166
         G=\\NTSERVER\WIN95.MAC

14. Power on the remoteboot client. The client will now boot to Windows 95 and
   complete the Windows 95 Setup program.

For more information about installation, refer to the Windows NT 4.0 Resource
Kit.
