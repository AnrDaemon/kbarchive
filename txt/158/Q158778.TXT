SYMPTOMS
========

In low memory situations, when you have background printing turned off the Apple
color printer may print out black vertical lines of varying thickness. Similar
to a UPC bar code.

If you try decrease the size of the Largest Unused Block to correct this problem,
Encarta may shut down with a bus error.

NOTE: These symptoms can vary depending on the computer used.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, obtain the latest driver from your printer
manufacturer.

To correct the Encarta Bus error, close all other open programs. This increases
the Largest Unused Block of memory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem has been observed with the LaserWriter 7.x drivers.

In some cases, a printer using the LaserWriter 8.1.1 driver may print the letter
"g" in place of each occurrence of a dash.
