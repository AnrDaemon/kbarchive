======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Not all processes, applications, and .bat files can be started with the AT
command.

MORE INFORMATION
================


In order to run an interactive application by using the AT command, the
application needs to be started with the local system account, and the "Allow
service to interact with desktop" check box must be checked. If the Schedule
service is set to log on as the local system, scheduled jobs cannot be validated
on the network. If you start the schedule service with a user account, jobs can
be validated on the network, but they cannot have any user interface, because
only the local system has sufficient privileges to allow a service to start a
program on the interactive desktop. Unless 16-bit applications have access to
the interactive desktop, they most likely not start as they run under Ntvdm.
Therefore, you can have network access or interactivity with the system (needed
by Ntvdm), but not both.



NOTE: This is by design, for security purposes. You do not want a regular user to
be able to schedule a job that would run when the administrator is logged on,
and use the administrator's credentials.

Additional query words: scheduler schedule
