KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual SourceSafe 4.0
---------------------

If you rename a file that is checked out in Visual SourceSafe 4.0, and you try to
check it back in, you get the following message:

   File "<working directory>\<filename>" not found

Where <working directory> is the working directory for the renamed file,
and <filename> is the new name of the file.

This behavior occurs because the copy of the checked-out file is not renamed by
Visual SourceSafe.

Visual SourceSafe 5.0 or later
------------------------------

If you try to rename a file that is checked out in Visual SourceSafe 5.0 or
later, the following message appears:

   Unable to rename the selected file

If you try to rename a file that is checked out to another user, the same message
appears.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before renaming a file in the Visual SourceSafe database, make sure that the
file is not checked out by any users.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
