======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SQL Server versions 6.0, 6.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating a new device in an application, such as SQL Enterprise Manager
(SEM), it may take several minutes to display the dialog box with the current
available devices and/or may possibly time out.

CAUSE
=====

If the computer has removable media, such as a removable floppy disk drive, and
it is not connected at the time the new device is being created, the system
times out when polling for available devices.

SQL Server makes a Win32 API call to GetDiskFreeSpace, which can take an extended
period of time to determine if the media is currently loaded. Any other
application that makes a call to GetDiskFreeSpace may experience the same
behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform one of the following:

 - Before creating the device, re-connect the removable media, such as a
   removable floppy disk drive or a zip drive.

-or-

 - If you are running SEM, you can increase the Query Timeout value by clicking
   the Tools Menu, then clicking Preferences, and then configure then the
   Connection tab.
