SUMMARY
=======

There are four different forms of X.400 O/R Addresses defined in Volume VIII,
Fascicle VIII.7 of the CCITT recommendations (that is, the X.400 Blue Book):
mnemonic, numeric, postal, and terminal.

Microsoft Exchange Server only supports the mnemonic form of the O/R Address,
which gives the description of a User or Distribution List in relation to the
Administration-domain-name (ADMD).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The mnemonic form of the O/R Address consists of the following attributes,
marked as either optional or mandatory:

   Administration-domain-name (ADMD)      MANDATORY
   Country-name (C)              MANDATORY

At least one of the following must be used, and any combination of the others in
the list may be used:

   Common-name (CN)              OPTIONAL
   Organizational-name (O)          OPTIONAL
   Organizational-unit-names (OU#)        OPTIONAL
   Personal-name                 OPTIONAL
      --may be either Surname(s),Given(g), or Initials(i)
   Private-domain-name (PRMD)          OPTIONAL

In addition to the above attributes, domain-defined attributes (DDAs) can also be
used.
