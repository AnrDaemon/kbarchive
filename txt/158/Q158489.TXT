SUMMARY
=======

When you migrate users from Microsoft Mail for PC Networks using the Microsoft
Exchange Migration Wizard, you may receive the following error:

   The selected Postoffice is read only. It must be writeable.

Verify that the Master.glb file is not locked open. For more information about
this problem, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q147506 XFOR: Err Msg: The Selected Postoffice is Read Only...

If it is not locked open, running the MAILINT utility against the postoffice will
return the following error:

   The GLB subdirectory was a file.

Checking the permissions of the GLB subdirectory will show that the subdirectory
has Read Only permissions. Removing that restriction will allow the Migration to
complete successfuly.

Note: MAILINT is a utility that checks the basic integrity of an Microsoft Mail
postoffice. It is available in the Microsoft Mail Resource Kit.

Additional query words: GLB directory files
