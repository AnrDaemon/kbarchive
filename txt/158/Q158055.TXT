PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a Word table into a PowerPoint presentation, some of the
gridlines do not display.

CAUSE
=====

The table gridlines are formatted with a 1/2 point line style. Word sends the
image to PowerPoint at a resolution of 300 dots per inch. This translation
results in the lines not displaying.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use a thicker line style, such as 1-1/2 points.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
