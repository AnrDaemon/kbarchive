TITLE   :XFOR: IMC NDR Resends Do Not Preserve Original Message Options
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Messages re-sent from Internet Mail Connector (IMC) non-delivery reports (NDRs)
do not preserve the options, such as sensitivity and priority, associated with
the original message. When a message goes through content conversion and is
returned with an NDR, some attributes are lost.

It is not possible to inspect the options exposed in the original message with
the Send Options button on the General tab of the message's property page,
because this button is disabled when resending.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If sending TNEF, the message integrity should be better than non-TNEF.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
