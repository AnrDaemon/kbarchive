TITLE   :PRB: ADDOBJECT Gives "A member object...already exists" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Adding an object to a container after removing that object, may result in the
following error message:

   A member object with this name already exists

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro does not allow the removal of an object if code for that object is
currently executing. Attempts to remove the object are delayed until the object
code has completed execution, and Visual FoxPro does not display any warning or
errors. This leads users to believe that the object has been removed when it has
not been removed. Trying to add the object back into the container causes the "A
member object with this name already exists" error because the object was not
removed and is still a part of the container.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Execute the following code (which instantiates a Form with a CommandButton
   object):

         PUBLIC oF
         oF = CreateObject('form')
         oF.AddObject('oCont','Cont')
         oF.Show()

         DEFINE CLASS Cont AS Container
           ADD OBJECT oCmd AS Cmd
           Visible = .t.
         ENDDEFINE

         DEFINE CLASS Cmd AS CommandButton
           Top = 50
           Visible=.t.
           PROCEDURE click
             oF.RemoveObject('ocont')     && No error occurs
             oF.AddObject('ocont','cont') && Produces error
           ENDPROC
         ENDDEFINE

2. When the Form appears, click on the command button. The "A member object with
   this name already exists" error message appears.
