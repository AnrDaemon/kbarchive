TITLE   :BUG: Incorrect Group Header Information in Report
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Group header information prints incorrectly when all of the following are true:

 - The group is set to start on a new page.

 - The group header is set to print on every page.

 - The group header and footer are the only bands that print on the page (no
   detail printed).

In this case, the group header information printed on the current page of the
group is actually the header information for the next record.

WORKAROUND
==========

For more information about one method of solving this problem, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q135617 BUG: Group Header Information Prints Incorrectly

The above method works in some cases, but may not work correctly with a Print
Preview. In the case of a Print Preview, follow these steps:

1. Move field(s) from the Group Header to Page Header. Double-click the field
   and change the following Print When options:

         Set the Print Repeated Values to No.
         In Also Print section,
            check When This Group Changes
            check When Detail Overflow to New Page/Column

2. Field(s) in the Group Footer remains the same.

3. Make sure that Group Properties (in Data Grouping) are set to "Start Each
   Group on a New Page" option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
