TITLE   :Stop 0x000000094 Running Windows NT 4.0 and NFS Maestro
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A STOP 0x00000094 error occurs on a system running Windows NT 4.0 and NFS
Maestro. The STOP code may look like the following.

   STOP: 0x00000094 (0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)
   KERNEL_STACK_LOCKED_AT_EXIT

CAUSE
=====

This STOP is caused by older versions of NFS Maestro, a 32-bit, kernel mode,
multithreaded NFS client. Because of changes in the file system APIs of Windows
NT 4.0, use of NFS Maestro versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.1.1, and 5.1.2 may result in a
STOP 0x00000094.

Version 5.1.3 of NFS Maestro for Windows NT 4.0 is designed to run on Windows NT
4.0 and will not cause these STOP error messages. Previous versions of NFS
Maestro do not support Windows NT 4.0 and can cause Windows NT 4.0 to have a
blue screen error message.
