MORE INFORMATION
================

The US Robotics Edgeserver is a hardware Remote Access Service solution that
combines Windows NT Server 4.0 within the US Robotics Total Control Enterprise
Network Hub. Windows NT Server 4.0 is pre-installed on the EdgeServer.

Although the Windows NT 4.0 Remote Access Service Server software supports
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS as a dial-up client, when used with the
Edgeserver, only PPP compliant clients are supported.
