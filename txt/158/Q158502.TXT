======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can only use the Macro Recorder and the Visual Basic Editor when there is a
presentation open. If you close all presentations and then click Macro on the
Tools menu, all the choices are unavailable (dimmed).

If you have the Visual Basic Editor open and close all open presentations, the
Visual Basic Editor closes when you close the last presentation.

   NOTE: The Macro Recorder is only available in PowerPoint 97 for Windows.

   There is no Macro Recorder for PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PowerPoint stores macros and Visual Basic code in presentations. If there is no
active presentation, there is no place to store the code. For this reason,
PowerPoint disables these features when no presentation is open.
