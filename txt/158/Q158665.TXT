TITLE   :FIX: 16-Bit Driver Keyset Cursor Operations with Query Timeout
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.65
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.65 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG #: 15946 (WINDOWS SQLBUG 2.65.0212)

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the client-side SPX Net-Library for Windows (Dbmsspx3.dll), the
Microsoft SQL Server 16-bit ODBC Driver version 2.65 may perform significantly
slower in operations involving both keyset-driven cursors and the setting of a
query timeout. Microsoft has observed a difference up to a factor of six when
Dbmsspx3.dll is used, versus the other available net- libraries. Note that for
this problem to occur, both a query timeout must be set and keyset-driven
cursors must be in use with Dbmsspx3.dll.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft client-side SPX
Net-Library for Windows (Dbmsspx3.dll) and Open Database Connectivity version
2.65. This problem has been corrected in U.S. Service Pack 2 for Microsoft SQL
Server version 6.5. For more information, contact your primary support provider.
