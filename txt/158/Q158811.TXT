PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit includes a utility called Performance Data Log
Service. This utility functions much like Performance Monitor except Performance
Data Log Service runs as a service and writes the performance data to a text
file for analysis in a spreadsheet or database package.

If Microsoft Exchange Server is installed, several objects are added to the list
of objects that can be monitored with the Performance Data Log Service. The
following Microsoft Exchange objects cannot be monitored with the Performance
Data Log Service.

   Microsoft Exchange Information Store
   Microsoft Exchange Information Store - private
   Microsoft Exchange Information Store - public

WORKAROUND
==========

The Microsoft Exchange objects listed above can be monitored with Windows NT
Performance Monitor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the resource kit utility
Performance Data Log Service. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
