TITLE   :FIX: CLEAR ALL with Object References Causes Page Fault
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If there are objects that reference each other, Visual FoxPro displays the
following error message when CLEAR ALL is carried out:

   This Program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

Visual FoxPro terminates due to an Invalid Page Fault.

WORKAROUND
==========

Delete object references before carrying out CLEAR ALL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create and run a program containing the following code:

         oform = CreateObject( "Form" )
         oform.AddObject("X", "CB")
         oform.AddObject("Y", "CB")
         oform.y.pointer=oform.x
         oform.x.pointer=oform.y
         CLEAR ALL  && This causes an Invalid Page Fault and
                    && shuts down Visual FoxPro.

         DEFINE CLASS CB as CommandButton
           pointer= .NULL.
         ENDDEFINE

Object references for "X" and "Y" above can be cleared by doing the following:

         oform.removeobject("X")
         oform.removeobject("Y")
