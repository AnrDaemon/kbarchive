TITLE   :One Drive's Directory List Is Replaced by That of Another
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The directory listing of a particular drive is replaced by the directory listing
of a floppy disk drive.

WORKAROUND
==========

drop-down box to select the desired drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Place a disk with files on it in drive A.

2. On the View menu, click Options, then choose Single Windows mode.

3. Open drive C and place it at the top of the screen. Consider this instance 1.

4. Below instance 1, open a second instance of My Computer. Consider this
   instance 2.

5. Double-click the drive A icon (instance 2).

6. Before instance 2 finishes its refresh, touch the windows of instance 1
   (either on the title bar or somewhere inside; the important thing is making
   instance 1 active).

The contents of drive A are now applied to the active window, which was drive C.
