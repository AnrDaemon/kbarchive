======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are working in a master document and you attempt to link text boxes in
subdocuments, the insertion point is displayed as a pitcher icon or you get the
following error message:

   Word cannot link text boxes if they are in different subdocuments.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Word allows you to link text boxes in the same document or
subdocument. Text boxes can be added to any subdocument in a master document;
however, a text box in one subdocument cannot be linked to a text box in a
different subdocument.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and exit text box linking mode (represented by a
pitcher icon), press the ESC key.
