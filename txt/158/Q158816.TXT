SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a hyperlink, another instance of the browser is loaded.

CAUSE
=====

An invalid frame name was specified as the target frame for the hyperlink. An
invalid name is a name that does not reference a frame in the current frame set.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most Web browsers allow you to target different frames within a frame set.
Assigning a target frame that exists within the context of the current frame set
activates this feature.

When a frame is assigned as a target, the name must exactly match a frame that
exists in the current frame set (note that these names are case-sensitive). If
the name of the frame is incorrect, a new instance of the browser will be
started.

Take for example, a frame set page with two frames aligned vertically where the
left frame is named "content" and the right frame is named "main." If you want a
hyperlink that is activated in the "content" frame to load a specified page in
the "main" frame, you must specify "main" as the target frame.

If, however, you set a link in the "content" frame to display a page in the
"Main" frame (and you use an uppercase "M" instead of a lowercase "m"), a
separate instance of the Web browser will be started.

For more information about frames and frame sets, click the Index tab in
FrontPage Help, type the following text

   "frames pages, creating" (without the quotation marks)

double-click "overview," and then double-click the "About Frames and Frames
Pages" topic.
