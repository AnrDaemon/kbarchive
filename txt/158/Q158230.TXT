======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A table-type or dynaset recordset may not see changes made by another recordset
even though the page timeout setting (set in the registry) has expired for that
ISAM. The internal recordset cache will not reflect the changes of the table.
This happens with DAO ISAM types such as FoxPro and Paradox.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only known way to get the recordset to successfully refresh the cache is to
call MoveFirst() for the recordset or move a large number of records ahead in
the recordset so that the cache gets refreshed.

If you choose to call MoveFirst() to refresh the cache, you can get the current
record position by calling CDaoRecordset::GetBookmark() and then calling
CDaoRecordset::SetBookmark() after the call to MoveFirst() to get back to the
record you were on. At that point, the record contains the new contents.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in DAO 3.0 version 3.000.2627.
Microsoft will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
