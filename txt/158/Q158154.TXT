TITLE   :WD97: Multiple Line Table Row in Text Box Won't Break
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Some text in a multiple-line table row disappears in a text box.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the following methods:

Method 1: Force the table row to break to the next linked text box by inserting
additional blank lines, or removing unnecessary lines before the table.

Method 2: Resize the text box and/or table to control where the table rows break.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a table row is large and expands to several lines, Microsoft Word permits
that row to break across page breaks, if needed. When this happens, part of the
table row would be on one page of the document and the remainder of the same
table row would be on the next page of the document. This behavior of Word
tables is selected by default. To check this option, select the Word table then,
on the Table menu, click Cell Height and Width, then select the Row tab. The
option that allows for this behavior is "Allow Row To Break Across Pages."

This behavior is not supported inside Text Boxes.

A single-line table row breaks from one text box to the next linked text box, as
expected. However, a multiple-line table row does not break from one text box to
the next linked text box until the entire table row is forced out of the current
text box. This behavior causes a multiple-line table row to be chopped off until
the entire table row is forced to the next linked text box.
