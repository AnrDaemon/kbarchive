TITLE   :XFOR: ErrMsg: Event ID 1035 - Unable to Open or Read a Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector displays the following event log
messages shortly before causing an application exception error:

 - 1035: Unable to open or read a message in the Microsoft Schedule+ Free/Busy
   Connector Inbox from %1.

 - 1022: 1 inbound message processed.

 - 1038: Unable to access the Microsoft Schedule+ Free/Busy Information Folder

If symbols are loaded, the Dr. Watson log normally indicates that an exception
error occurred in the RtlEnterCriticalSection function, often at location
77f6748e.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector may cause an exception error when
processing a message containing Free/Busy data from another server that contains
multiple users, and the users are not in the directory service. The users
existed at one time and were deleted. The tombstone on the information has not
yet expired, causing the last update of Free/Busy data to be sent.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Exchange Server 4.0 and 5.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on obtaining the
