======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Changing the Microsoft Exchange Organization name is a complex task. If you
change the Microsoft Exchange Organization name, you must reinstall Microsoft
Exchange Server on all servers in all sites.

This article explains how to change the name of a Microsoft Exchange
Organization.

NOTE: You will need to create new client profiles for all users with mailboxes
within the site. The Outlook client profile caches the X500 directory name of
the mailbox server.

If you do not create a new profile, you may receive the following application
event IDs on the server:

Event ID: 1023
MsExchangeIS Private
Type: Failure Audit
Category: Logons

Description: Domain\User was validated as
/o=ORG/ou=SITE/cn=Recipients/cn=USER
but was unable to log on to /o=OLDORG/ou=OLDSITE/cn=Recipients/cn=USER.

MORE INFORMATION

To change the name of a Microsoft Exchange Organization, follow the steps
below:

1. Copy all user mail to Personal Folders (PST file).

2. Copy all Public Folders to Personal Folders (PST file).

3. Using the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, export all
   mailboxes, custom recipients, and distribution lists to a .csv file.

4. Modify the .csv file created in Step 3, replacing all instances of the old
   Organization name with the new name.

5. Remove and reinstall Microsoft Exchange with the required Organization and
   Site names.

6. Using the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, import all the
   data from the .csv file created in steps 3 and 4.

7. Move the mailbox and Public Folder information from the PST file(s) created
   in steps 1 and 2 to the server-based store.

The above steps will have to performed on each server in each site of the
Microsoft Exchange Organization. All connectors will have to reinstalled. If the
Key Management server was installed, it will have to reinstalled and all
mailboxes will have to security enabled again.
