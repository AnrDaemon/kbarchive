TITLE   :XCLN: Unable to Download the Offline Address Book
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0; :4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange for Windows 95, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On the Tools menu, when you click Synchronize and click Download Address Book,
the following error message may appear:

   An error occurred while connecting to the Microsoft Exchange Server.

This is followed by a second error message:

   Unable to download the offline Address Book.

This can occur if the profile contains only the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
transport.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The expected behavior is that this option will be grayed out when the Microsoft
Exchange transport is not present. Microsoft Mail for PC Networks has its own
Download Address Book function.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
