TITLE   :FIX: Setting Grid RowHeight to Large Number Affects Page Down
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500aFIX kbvfp500bugkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set the RowHeight of a grid to a large number and you cannot see two
complete rows in the grid, the PAGE DOWN key might not function properly. It
might page down once and stop, or it might not page down at all. If the
RowHeight is set to a number such as 150 or higher, then a general protection
fault (GPF) might occur when you press the PAGE DOWN key one or more times while
in the grid.

WORKAROUND
==========

Make sure that there are at least two rows of data showing in the grid, or set
the RowHeight property of the grid to a smaller number.

STATUS
======

This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0a.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The RowHeight of a grid must be set so that you can see at least two rows of
data in the grid or else the PAGE DOWN key does not move through the records
properly. The PAGE UP key and the ARROW keys work correctly, but PAGE DOWN key
does not work. When the RowHeight is set less than 100, the PAGE DOWN key does
not work. When the setting is more than 150, a general protection fault occurs
when you press the PAGE DOWN key one or more times.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form and add a table to the DataEnvironment.

2. Add a grid to the form and set the RowSource to the table in the
   DataEnvironment.

3. Change the RowHeight of the grid to 75.

4. Run the form and press the PAGE DOWN key. Note that it might page down once
   or not at all.

5. Modify the form and change the RowHeight of the grid to 200.

6. Run the form and press the PAGE DOWN key one or more times. A general
   protection fault occurs and Visual FoxPro closes.
