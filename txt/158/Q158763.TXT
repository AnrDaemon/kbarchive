TITLE   :FIX: Server Out of Memory when Inserting into Text/Image Fields
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER::2.5,2.65
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, versions 2.5, 2.65 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG #: 16076 (NT: 6.5)

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the 32-bit SQL Server Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) driver to insert
chunks of data into text/image columns with the SQLPutData API may cause error
701, "There is insufficient memory to execute the query," from SQL Server 6.5.

WORKAROUND
==========

The amount of data inserted into the image/text field can be increased by
increasing the amount of memory allocated to SQL Server and the amount of memory
allocated to the procedure cache.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft ODBC driver
versions 2.5 and 2.65. This problem has been corrected in the SQL Server ODBC
driver included with the U.S. Service Pack 2 for Microsoft SQL Server version
6.5. For more information, contact your primary support provider.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If your system is configured to the minimal SQL Server configuration of 8 MB of
memory and 30 percent of memory allocated to the procedure cache, data that is
over 2 MB in size may exhibit the problem. Data of about 1 MB in size does not
exhibit any problem.
