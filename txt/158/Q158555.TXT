======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Windows 
 - Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 97 Deluxe for Windows 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you've installed Encarta 97 in Windows 3.x, Windows does not restart.

CAUSE
=====

Some S3 video drivers conflict with the WIN32S components that Encarta 97
installs. This prevents Windows from running correctly.

WORKAROUND
==========

Edit the System.ini file and to comment out the reference to W32s.386. To edit
the file, do the following:

1. From the MS-DOS prompt, type the following and then press Enter:

   "Edit C:\Windows\System.ini" (without the quotation marks)

2. To comment out the line, type a semicolon in front of the following line,
   located in the [386 enh] section of the System.ini.:

         DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WIN32S\W32S.386

So that the line reads:

        ;DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WIN32S\W32S.386

NOTE: This workaround allows you to get back in to Windows. To fully resolve this
problems, obtain an updated video driver for your video card from the
manufacturer of your video card.

NOTE: If the new video driver does not correct the problem, you will need to use
the steps above to comment out the reference to W32S.386 again.
