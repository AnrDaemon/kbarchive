TITLE   :HOWTO: Deploy a Project Adds Two .GIF Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When deploying a Web project, two files that are not in the project are created
in the deployment location. By default, they are FOLDER.GIF and HTMLFILE.GIF.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can customize these images by editing the following lines in the SRCSAFE.INI
file:

   Img_File = HTMLFILE.GIF
   Img_Folder = FOLDER.GIF

to read, for example:

   Img_File = MYIMGFILE.GIF
   Img_Folder = MYIMGFOLDER.GIF

NOTE: The default .GIF files are located in the Visual SourceSafe install
directory on the server. If you customize these SRCSAFE.ini lines, you need to
be sure to have the actual .GIFs in this location. For example, not having
MYIMGFILE.GIF under the VSS directory will prevent it from being copied to the
deploy location.

Placing a semicolon (;) at the beginning of these lines will also prevent these
files from being copied to the deployment location and will cause the Site Map
file to be created with a red "X" glyph where these glyphs would normally
appear.

Steps to Reproduce
------------------

1. Create a Visual SourceSafe project.

2. In the Visual SourceSafe administrator, designate this project as a Web
   project and specify a Deployment Path, such as C:\deploy.

3. In the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, deploy the project. Note that the
   deployment folder contains the files from the project and the two additional
   .gif files.
