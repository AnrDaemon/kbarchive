TITLE   :SMS: Hardware Inventory Stops Responding with Madge Token Ring
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbhw kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

During the Hardware Inventory phase of a Systems Management Server client
computer running Windows 3.x, the client may stop responding and need to be
restarted. Further analysis shows that the client is stopping at the
NovellNetcardInfo stage.

This problem may occur on computers running MS-DOS and Windows 3.x with the
NetWare redirector and a Madge Token Ring network adapter card.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is due to the revision of the Madge Token Ring driver that is being
used. As of October 28, 1996, the latest driver is version 4.3. This version of
the driver can be obtained from Madge (www.madge.com).

By replacing the Madge driver with the latest version, the inventory process will
complete and the network adapter card will be inventoried correctly.
