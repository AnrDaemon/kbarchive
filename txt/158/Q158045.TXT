======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the total size of the files in a folder is 4 GB, Windows Explorer reports the
size as 0 bytes. If the total size is greater than 4 GB, Windows Explorer
reports the total size less 4 GB.

CAUSE
=====

Windows Explorer is limited to reporting a total size of 4 GB in a folder.
Although you can see folders larger than 4 GB, Windows Explorer does not report
the correct total size.

RESOLUTION
==========

To see the total size for files in a folder, use the DIR command at a command
prompt.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
