The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC SDK version 2.5 
 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, versions 2.5, 2.65 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

While fetching results using ODBC SQL Server driver, you may occasionally see
the following error message:

   SQLState 22002: Indicator variable required but not supplied

This error message is not documented in either the SQL Server driver Help file or
the ODBC 2.5 SDK specification document Readme25.txt that ships with the ODBC
Desktop Driver Pack 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem is a documentation bug with the ODBC 2.5 SDK for the SQL State 22002
on SQLFetch. The SQL Server driver follows the ODBC SDK 2.5 specification and
returns the error message correctly, as described in the specification.

According to the ODBC 2.5 specification, the driver should return error 22002 on
SQLFetch when the data fetched in the particular column is NULL and the
SQLBindCol function did not specify a valid pointer for the pcbValue parameter
(indicator variable). This is because the driver returns SQL_NULL_DATA in the
pcbValue parameter when the data fetched for a particular column is NULL. When
the pcbValue is specified as a NULL pointer in your application, the driver
raises the correct error message according to the specification.

NOTE: It is generally a good programming practice to specify valid pointers to
the pcbValue parameter.
