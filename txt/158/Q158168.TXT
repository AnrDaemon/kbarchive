TITLE   :XADM: SA Failed to Start: Logon Error 7013
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange System Attendant service may fail to start; error message
7013 appears:

   The user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer.

This will cause other Microsoft Exchange services to not start.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the error, verify the appropriate properties are set for the service
account in User Manager. If that does not resolve the error, enter the service
account and password for the failed service, as follows:

1. In Control Panel Services, click System Attendant and click Startup.

2. Type the Exchange service account and password for This Account.

3. Start the System Attendant

This may need to be done for other Microsoft Exchange services as well.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error may be received if the service account password is correct and the
account is able to logon to the local computer. If changing the password and
rebooting the computer does not resolve the error, the above steps may prevent
the error 7013 or other related logon failures.

The Log On As option in This Account is used to assign a logon user account to a
service. If there is an existing user account for that service make certain that
the user account has the Password Never Expires option selected, and has
memberships in the appropriate groups.
