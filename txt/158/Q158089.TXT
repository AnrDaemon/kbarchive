======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Macintosh 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a link (for example, Web Links or Yearbook) to the Internet from
Encarta 97, your web browser opens, but the Encarta page does not open.

CAUSE
=====

Your browser does not support GURL AppleEvent. This is used by Internet Config
and is required to connect you to the Encarta Internet site.

RESOLUTION
==========

Update your web browser to a version that supports GURL AppleEvent and remove
all previous versions of your web browser. Browsers that support this
requirement include Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 or later, or Netscape 2.0 or
later.

NOTE: Microsoft Internet Explorer version 2.1 is included on the Encarta 1997
compact disc.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Encarta 1997 uses Internet Config version 1.3 to determine what application to
connect to a specific URL on the Internet. If the application does not
understand the instructions Internet Config sends, the browser application may
start, but it does not connect to the designated Web location.
