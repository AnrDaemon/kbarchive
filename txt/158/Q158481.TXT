The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a Word 97 document in Word 6.x or 7.x, if that document contains
floating objects and was saved in either Microsoft Word 6.x/95 format or Rich
Text Format (RTF), the objects are stacked one on top of the other on the first
page.

NOTE: This problem does not occur when you save a Word 97 document that contains
inline objects into Microsoft Word 6.x/95 or RTF formats.

CAUSE
=====

During conversion, the objects become detached from their original anchors.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, save the document in Word 97 native format, and
install the Word 97 converter on the computer where you have Word 6.x or 7.x
installed. When you open the document, the objects will be positioned
correctly.
