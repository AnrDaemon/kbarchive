TITLE   :XCLN: Options Not Available in Forms Designer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer, following options may be
unavailable:

   Include a link to the selected item
   Attach a copy of the selected item

These check boxes are grayed out.

CAUSE
=====

The options are not available because Microsoft Exchange does not currently
support messages as attachments for custom message types.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do not use a custom form for the Response form's
item type. Choose a standard type like IPM.Note or IPM.Post.

1. When designing a form, on the View menu, click Form Properties.

2. On the Events tab, select a standard response form.
