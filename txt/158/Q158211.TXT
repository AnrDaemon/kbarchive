KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An SNA Server connection changes from Active to Inactive status and cannot be
reactivated. This causes all users who are using this connection to lose their
sessions. The following events are logged in the Microsoft Windows NT
Application Event Log (in the following order):

   Event ID: 579
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: Source and destination incompatibility, Message = <aa,bb>,
   Parameters = <cc,dd>

   Event ID: 699
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: Invalid message: MsgType 16, MhType 1
   Message Header: <data>

The following events may also be logged, following the 579 and 699 errors:

   Event ID: 360
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: (B4A) Unexpected error logged

   Event ID: 39
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: Connection <name> failed: No link service available

NOTE: This problem occurs more frequently when you connect over the SNA Server
NetWare IPX/SPX client interface.

CAUSE
=====

If the SNA Server receives notification that an SNA client LAN session has
ended, at the same time when a message is being sent to an SNA Server link
service, an internal SNA Server addressing problem occurs, causing the
underlying link service to fail.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
2.1, 2.11, and 2.11 Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest
Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
