SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install Clipboard Viewer using the Msbatch.inf
file for batch installations of Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this article.
Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you proceed.

When you specify that Clipboard Viewer should be installed using the Msbatch.inf
file, it is not installed. To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that the [OptionalComponents] section of the Msbatch.inf file
   contain "Clipboard Viewer"=1 instead of "Clipboard Viewer"=0.

2. Create or modify the Custom.inf file to include these entries:

   [Precopyfiles]
   clip.inf

   [load_inf]
   clip.inf

The completed Custom.inf file should look similar to the following example. Your
exact file may vary:

   [Version]
   LayoutFile=layout.inf
   Signature="$CHICAGO$"

   [Custom_Precopy]
   CopyFiles=PrecopyFiles

   [DestinationDirs]
   PrecopyFiles=2

   [PrecopyFiles]
   clip.inf

   [load_inf]
   clip.inf
