TITLE   :Error Level 2 Returned on DELETE Command When No Files Found
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The DELETE command returns an error level of 0 for a successful operation.
However, beginning with Windows NT 4.0, DELETE returns an error level of 2 if it
finds no files to delete.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This change was made so that batch file designers can detect whether or not
files are actually deleted. Batch files that expect 0 to be returned if no files
are found to be deleted must be modified for the new return value.

All versions of MS-DOS, Windows 95, and earlier versions of Windows NT return 0
in this circumstance.

Additional query words: prodnt errorlevel
