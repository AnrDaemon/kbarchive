KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork kbtshoot kbusage smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 1.2 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Quick Windows Viewer remains unavailable when you try to remotely control a
computer running Windows NT 4.0 (Build 1381, U.S. or French version) that is
both configured with the French Regional Settings and located in a domain other
than the one containing the computer running Systems Management Server 1.2 (U.S.
or French version).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when all of the following conditions are true:

 - Either the Windows NT 4.0 client or the computer running Systems Management
   Server on Windows NT 4.0 are configured with the French regional settings.

 - These two computers are located in different domains, without a trust
   relationship.

 - These two computers attempt to use the same user account with a different
   password.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do any of the following:

 - Use the same user account and password.

 - Use the trust relationship (for example, DOMAIN2 trusts DOMAIN1) and include
   the DOMAIN1\MFST user account to the local administrator's group of DOMAIN2.

 - Use the English regional settings.
