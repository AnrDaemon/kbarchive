TITLE   :XCLN: Setup Could Not Write to File Mapiform.vbx
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you use the Chess form and you quit and log off the client, if you run the
Microsoft Exchange client Setup, the following error message may appear:

   Setup could not write to file: "c:\win95\system\mapiform.vbx" This file is
   currently being used by another application. Close any open applications.

CAUSE
=====

Mapiform.vbx should be unloaded after you have quit the Microsoft Exchange
client and closed all messages and executable files, but Chess.exe is not
unloaded when you quit and log off the client. Therefore, Mapiform.vbx and
Mapi.dll remain loaded in memory and affect Setup when it tries to update or
remove them. This only occurs with the Chess form.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
