TITLE   :Cannot Connect to Personal Web Server from Remote System
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:mspwsw95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Personal Web Server versions 1.0, 1.0a for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After sharing files with Personal Web Server, you may not be able to connect to
the computer from a remote system.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may be caused by a problem with name resolution. When you attempt
to connect to a remote system using a machine name with the Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), TCP/IP must first find the Internet
Protocol (IP) address of the remote system. If the remote machine name is not
registered with the Domain Name System (DNS) or Windows Internet Name Service
(WINS) server you are using, or is not listed in your HOSTS file, TCP/IP cannot
resolve the name.

RESOLUTION
==========

The user of the remote system should contact the system administrator or
Internet service provider (ISP) and have the machine registered in the DNS or
WINS servers on the network. Or, the user of the client system can contact their
system administrator to add an entry to the HOSTS file for the remote system.
