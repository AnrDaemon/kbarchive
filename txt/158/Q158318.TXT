TITLE   :XFOR: IMC Doesn't Deliver Mail When Service Is Started
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Mail Connector (IMC) does not deliver mail immediately upon startup
when it is past its scheduled time to dial.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want the IMC to dial upon startup instead of waiting for the next cycle,
you can configure the IMC to use available RAS phone book entries to retrieve
and send mail.

1. Ensure that you are using Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 Service Pack
   2 (SP2) or a later version.

2. When configuring the dial-up properties, choose to dial "Every."

REFERENCES
==========

See the online help for the Dial-Up Connections on "Dial" for details.
