TITLE   :XFOR: Dir-Sync: Map Template Info Between MSMail & Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

During directory synchronization, Microsoft Mail postoffices can exchange
template information with each other and with Microsoft Exchange. In order to
accomplish this, each Microsoft Mail template attribute must be mapped to a
Microsoft Exchange property using the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator
program. Additionally, Microsoft Exchange can also send template information to
Microsoft Mail postoffices during directory synchronization. This information
must also be mapped in the same manner.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program and open the
   Configuration Container - Servers - Directory Synchronization.

2. For Microsoft Exchange to Microsoft Mail template mapping, click the Outgoing
   Templates tab, or, for Microsoft Mail to Microsoft Exchange template mapping,
   click the Incoming Templates tab.

3. Click New. You will be asked for the Microsoft Mail attribute as it appears
   in the *.tpl file (without punctuation: that is, "Address", not "~Address")
   and the Microsoft Exchange attribute to map to\from.
