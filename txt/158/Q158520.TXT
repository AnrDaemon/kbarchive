TITLE   :NwSapAgent Service Will Not Start with DiscPort CD-ROM Tower
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install NwSapAgent on a Windows NT Server computer that has a DiscPort
CD-ROM tower attached, the NwSapAgent service will not start and the following
errors will appear in Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 7023
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Description: The Sap Agent terminated with the following error: The service
   has not been started.

   Event ID: 8504
   Source: NwSapAgent
   Description: The description for Event ID "8504" in source "NwSapAgent" could
   not be found.

CAUSE
=====

The DiscPort CD-ROM tower software loads as a service in Windows NT. When the
DiscPort service starts prior to NwSapAgent, NwSapAgent fails to start. When
attempting to start NwSapAgent after the Windows NT Server computer is running,
the service will still fail to start.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, the NwSapAgent must be started prior to the DiscPort
CD-ROM tower service. Use Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) to change the DiscPort
service to start after the NwSapAgent, as follows:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and locate the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MTDPServices

2. From the Edit menu, click Add Value. Type "DependOnService" (without the
   quotation marks) in the Value Name field. Select REG_MULTI_SZ for the Data
   Type. Type "NwSapAgent" (without the quotation marks) in the String field,
   and then click OK.

3. Quit Registry Editor.

4. Shutdown and restart your computer.
