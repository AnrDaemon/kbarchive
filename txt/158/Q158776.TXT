TITLE   :SNA Server May Log Event 23, Qualifier 0x000A
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1,3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP1, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using SNA Server version 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later with a remote
link service (which communicates to a distributed link service running on a
"remote" computer running SNA Server), SNA Server may log Event 23 with a
qualifier code of 000A. This code is not documented in the "SNA Server Reference
Guide:"

   

   Event:  23
  Source: SNA Server
  Description: Connection TOKEN1   using Link Service SNAREM1  failed
               Qualifier = 000A

CAUSE
=====

This qualifier can occur if:

   The server running the distributed link service has been powered off or has
   failed.

   -or-

   The LAN session between the remote link service and the distributed link
   service has been lost. To diagnose the cause of a LAN disconnect, a Network
   General Sniffer(TM) or Microsoft Network Monitor trace of the LAN session
   disconnect should be captured.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If a connection failure occurs, SNA Server logs Event 23 to the Windows NT
application event log, indicating a "qualifier" code that provides information
on the cause of the failure. These qualifier codes are documented in the "SNA
Server Reference Guide."

However, a qualifier code of 000A is not documented in the SNA Server Reference
Guide, because this special code is returned by the remote link service that is
new with SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1.
