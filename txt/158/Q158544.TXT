KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Notes:

 - The information in this article has been tested by Microsoft running
   Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0. This has not been confirmed by
   Hewlett-Packard; however, they did conclude that the IBM MPA/A is not listed
   as a supported or tested device on their Vectra series computers.

 - The following assumes you have disabled SERIAL.SYS, parallel ports, and any
   COM ports that use interrupts that could cause conflicts when you use this
   card.

After you configure an IBM Multiprotocol SDLC Adapter on a Hewlett-Packard Vectra
XU 6/150 computer, the connection status may remain in an inactive state after
you try to activate the service.

CAUSE
=====


RESOLUTION
==========

Use a different SDLC card. Supported adapters can be found in the SNA Server
Companion Product Catalog and in Isvcatal.doc in the \Collatrl\General directory
on the SNA Server compact disc.

The IBM and Hewlett-Packard products discussed here are manufactured by IBM and
Hewlett-Packard Corporation respectably, vendors independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products performance or
reliability.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you run a DLC trace (linkmsg.trc), you will see an open link response (rsp)
error 000A. This is a fatal LLC hardware error that is also reported in the
application log of the event viewer.
