SUMMARY
=======

When troubleshooting objects and counters being used by Performance Monitor, you
need to locate all the Extensible Counters. Extensible Counters are counters
that are added to Performance Monitor by applications. Examples of applications
that add counters to Windows NT are SQL Server and Microsoft Exchange. Both of
those applications install extensible counters to Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use Exctrlst.exe, which comes in the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit, to bring up a
list of all of the Extensible Counters found in the Registry. The location of
the counters is:

Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\ 
ServiceName\Performance\Library

Exctrlst.exe can be run locally or remotely.

If you believe that one of the Extensible Counters is causing a problem on your
computer, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
