TITLE   :Protocols Major and Minor Version Registry Keys Not Updated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Srvinfo.exe that ships with the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit against
a server that was upgraded to Windows NT 4.0 from a previous version of Windows
NT, the protocols may be listed as being from the previous version (even though
they were upgraded to the Windows NT 4.0 version of those protocols).

CAUSE
=====

The following keys were not updated during the upgrade process:

WINS CLIENT (TCP/IP)
--------------------

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\NETBT\CurrentVersion\MajorVersion

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\NETBT\CurrentVersion\MinorVersion

NETBEUI Protocol
----------------

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\NBF\CurrentVersion\MajorVersion

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\NBF\CurrentVersion\MinorVersion

NWLink NetBIOS
--------------

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\NwlnkNB\CurrentVersion
\MajorVersion

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\NwlnkNB\CurrentVersion
\MinorVersion

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

NWLINK IPX/SPX Compatible Transport
-----------------------------------

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\NwlnkIpx\CurrentVersion
\MajorVersion

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\NwlnkIpx\CurrentVersion
\MinorVersion

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use Registry Editor to change the MajorVersion from 3 to 4 and change the
MinorVersion from 51(decimal) to 0. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and edit each of the earlier protocol
   subkeys to the following:

   MajorVersion:REG_DWORD:0x4
   MinorVersion: REG_DWORD:0

2. Quit Registry Editor and restart your computer.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
