SUMMARY
=======

Dbdaoawx.exe contains the source and implementation of two Custom AppWizards for
creating MFC-based DLLs or EXE applications that utilize the DAO SDK. The DAO
SDK is shipped with Visual C++ and is separate from the MFC DAO classes. This
sample provides AppWizard support for the DAO SDK, which otherwise would not
have any.
