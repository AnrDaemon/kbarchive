 - Microsoft GEX, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to play GEX with a keyboard.

KEY CONTROLS
------------

To progress through the game, GEX must collect the remote control in each level
to continue to the next level. The following describes which keys cause each
action.

Key      Action

X        Jump/Enter TV
Z        Tail whip/Remote bar
C        Tongue lash
V        Run
F1       Help
F2       Start a new game
F3/PAUSE Pause
F4       Toggle between full screen and window
F5       320 x 224 window
F6       640 x 448 window
ESC      Exit the game

IF GEX KEYBOARD CONTROLS DON'T WORK
-----------------------------------

If GEX keyboard controls don't work, make sure all connections between your
keyboard and computer are properly secured.

NOTE: Certain key configurations will not allow three simultaneous key presses,
which often results in not being able to perform certain game actions
simultaneously. You will hear a keyboard "tick" from the PC speaker when this
happens.
