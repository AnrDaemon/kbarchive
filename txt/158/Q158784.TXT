SYMPTOMS
========

When you share a folder for Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) access in
Windows Explorer, enabling the Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) option does not
affect the server.

CAUSE
=====

SSL security is not supported in Personal Web Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is currently no support for SSL security in Personal Web Server. If you
require this functionality, consider upgrading to Microsoft Windows NT Server
and Internet Information Server.

NOTE: The version of Personal Web Server that is included with Microsoft Windows
95 OEM Service Release 2 is the only version that has an option for SSL
security. The versions of Personal Web Server included with Microsoft Internet
Explorer Starter Kit and released on the Web do not have the SSL option.
