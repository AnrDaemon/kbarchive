SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install the Network Monitor agent using the
Msbatch.inf file for batch installations of Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this article.
Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you proceed.

Using the Infinst.exe tool from the Admin\Nettools\Netsetup folder on the Windows
95 CD-ROM, point to the Admin\Nettools\Netmon folder. This incorporates all the
settings and files into the network Setup.

Once this process is complete, get the updated Nm95setp.dll file.

In the Msbatch.inf file, modify the [Network] section to include the following
line:

   services=nmagent
