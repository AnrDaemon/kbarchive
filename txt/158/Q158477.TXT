TITLE   :WD97: Object Deleted When You Run Letter Wizard
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbtemplate

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you add an object or WordArt text effects to your document and then run the
Letter Wizard (Tools menu), the object may be deleted.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the object is anchored to a paragraph that was modified
when you ran the Letter Wizard. For example, if a WordArt object is anchored to
a paragraph that is formatted with the Date style, and you change the Date Line
on the Letter Format tab in the Letter Wizard, the WordArt object is removed.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you have already run the wizard and your object has been deleted, click the
Undo button until your object appears. Attach the object to a paragraph that is
not a Letter Wizard element--for example, attach the object to a paragraph
formatted with the body text or Normal style and then rerun the Letter Wizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
