SUMMARY
=======

To deploy Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or 3.01 with Systems Management
Server, download Ie30.pdf from ftp.microsoft.com. The file is located in the
Bussys\Winnt\Sms-public directory. After downloading the file, copy it to the

server. During the package creation, import the Ie30.pdf file.

The Ie30.pdf file supports both an automated installation of Internet Explorer
and a custom installation, in which the user provides setup information. Be
aware that if you choose the automated installation, the client computer will be
restarted during the Internet Explorer Setup process.

You can customize Internet Explorer 3.0 before using Systems Management Server
to deploy it. With the Internet Explorer Administration Kit 3.0 (IEAK), you can
do any of the following:

 - Customize the look of Microsoft Internet Explorer with a company name or
   logo.

 - Create a single, one-click installation package of all Microsoft Internet
   Explorer components, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, NetMeeting
   conferencing software, and Internet Mail and News for distribution or
   download.

 - Preconfigure and control options for users within corporations.

 - Manage browser settings and user options on an ongoing basis from a single,
   central server location within an intranet.

You can obtain the new version of the IEAK from Microsoft by completing the
online request form at http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ieak/.
