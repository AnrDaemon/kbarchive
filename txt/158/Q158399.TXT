MORE INFORMATION
================

The destination message transfer agent (MTA) will look at the time stamp given
to the message by the receiving/initial MTA, interim MTA's, or the originating
client. If there is more than seven days difference among the date/time of the
destination MTA and the time/date stamp on the messages, messages will time out
with this NDR. Messages can be sent from Exchange users on the destination MTA
server with no apparent problems. Sending or telnetting messages will arrive in
the system and can be verified in the logs, but will not be delivered. The above
NDR will be sent to the originator. To resolve the problem:

1. In Control Panel Date/Time, change the date and time to the correct date and
   time.

2. Verify that the date and time on any other Microsoft Exchange Server
   computers in the Site are correct.

3. Verify that the client computer originating the message has the correct date
   and time.

4. Verify that any interim Message Transfer Agents such as PCMail External.exe
   and X.400 MTA's have the correct date and time.
