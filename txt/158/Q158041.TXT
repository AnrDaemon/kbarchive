TITLE   :Xircom CreditCard Ethernet Adapter IIps with Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT 4.0 Server and Workstation compact discs provided the driver for
the Xircom Ethernet Adapter IIps in the following directory:
I386\Drvlib.nic\Xircom\Ce2. The driver can be installed through the Control
Panel PCMCIA tool or through the Control Panel Network tool.

If the Control Panel PCMCIA tool is used to install the Xircom driver, the tool
will request the use of the CE2NDIS3 driver, which is the older Windows NT 3.5x
driver, and the driver will not install.

If the Control Panel Network tool is used to install the driver, the Xircom
Adapter will fail to initialize correctly. In some cases, the driver appears to
load, but does not function correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The PCMCIA database located in the Windows NT registry references the older
version of the driver, CE2NDIS3. The Windows NT 4.0 driver is referenced by
CE2XPS, which conflicts with the PCMCIA database.


STATUS
======

The Windows NT 3.51 driver does work as a temporary solution; however, an
alternative network adapter is recommended until a new driver is available. The
driver is supplied by Xircom and can be downloaded from the Xircom web site,
http://www.xircom.com/

If you currently have Windows NT 3.51 the driver can be found in the
Drvlib\Netcard\X86\Xce10 on the CD and be copied to the root of a floppy disk.

In either case, use the Control Panel Network tool and select the Have Disk
option from the Adapters tab to install the driver.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
