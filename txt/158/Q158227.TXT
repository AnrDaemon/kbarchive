TITLE   :Mac Encarta 97: Pasting Text into Search Box Finds Nothing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER::1997 edition; WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhowto

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Macintosh 
 - Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Windows 
 - Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 97 Deluxe for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to perform a search in Encarta, nothing is found.

This occurs when you perform a search by copying two or more words of an article,
and then pasting it into a text box in the Word Search flyout.

CAUSE
=====

Encarta copyright information is pasted into the text box along with the
selected text.

The Encarta copyright information accompanies the selected text when you copy
more than one word at a time. This is by design.

The following is an example of the copyright information:

   "Greek Mythology," Microsoft(R) Encarta(R) 97 Encyclopedia(C) 1993-1996
   Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

WORKAROUND
==========

Manually type the words you want to search for into the text box, or copy the
words one at a time into the text box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because each article does not contain the copyright information in the actual
text, Encarta's search engine will not find all of the words specified in the
query.

You can view all of the copied text by pasting it into a word processor, such as
Microsoft Word, or Apple's SimpleText.
