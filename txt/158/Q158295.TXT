TITLE   :XCLN: Remote Mail: The Mail Headers Could Not Be Displayed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Remote Mail on the Tools menu in Microsoft Exchange Server, you
may receive one of the following error messages:

   The mail headers could not be displayed. Internal MAPI error while
   establishing remote interface MAPI 1.0 - 839 - [80004005]

OR

   Microsoft Exchange
   The mail headers could not be displayed. Internal mapi error : there is a
   communication problem between this application and the service provider.
   Restart the application.

OR

   The item could not be displayed. The action could not be completed. Microsoft
   Exchange Client - 9997 - [80070005]

NOTE: "Sync all folders" appears to function properly. Connecting with Windows 95
dial-up networking (DUN) first and then starting Microsoft Exchange Server
online also works correctly.

CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur if your computer name contains the "at sign" (@). The
first error message listed above occurs when you try to use the Remote Mail
feature in Microsoft Exchange. The second error message occurs when you send a
message with The Microsoft Network Online Service information service installed
in your default profile.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the at sign from your computer name. To do so, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. Click the Identification tab.

3. Change the computer name so that it does not contain the "@" character, and
   then click OK.

4. When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.
