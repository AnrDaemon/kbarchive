TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Start VFP from Run Open Line If Space in Path
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Visual FoxPro is installed in a directory with a space in the folder name,
Visual FoxPro cannot be started from the Run Open line in Windows 95 or Windows
NT.

One of two things happen: either a directory screen is displayed or a message
like the following appears:

   Cannot find the file 'C:\Directoryname'(or one of its components). Make sure
   the path and file name are correct and that all required libraries are
   available.

The directory screen or folder appears when the first word (used prior to the
space in the name) matches the name of an existing folder. For instance, if
Visual FoxPro is installed in the My vfp folder and you have another folder
called My, the My folder is displayed.

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro is installed in a directory with a space in the folder name.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you need to start Visual FoxPro from the command line, do one of the
following:

   Enclose the entire path in quotes.

   -or-

   Make sure there are no spaces in the path to the Visual FoxPro executable.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

This problem is not specific to Visual FoxPro. Other programs such as Word do not
start from the Run Open line if there is a space in the path name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Place a space somewhere in the path to Visual FoxPro.

2. Start Visual FoxPro from the Open line in the Run window.
