The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a file embedded in Public Folder with some older
applications, the following error message may appear:

   A problem occurred while working with, or connecting to, an embedded object
   or its source application.

This is known to be a problem with the following applications:

   Microsoft Word 2.0
   Microsoft Excel 4.0
   Microsoft Powerpoint 3.0
   Microsoft Project 4.0
   Microsoft Excel 5.0, 32-bit version only

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, do one of the following:

 - Copy or move the document to the file system and open the document.

   -or-

 - Upgrade to the newest version of the application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem will occur even if you use a later version of an application but
post to the public folder in an older file format. For example, you create a
presentation in PowerPoint version 7.0 and save it in PowerPoint version 4
format. If the file is placed into a public or private folder using a
drag-and-drop operation, the same error occurs when you attempt to open it.

This issue is documented in the Readme.wri on the Microsoft Exchange Server
compact disc as follows:

   1.4 Opening Files in Folders
   If you cannot open a file in a Microsoft Exchange folder, highlight it, save
   it on your hard disk, and then use the appropriate application to open it.
