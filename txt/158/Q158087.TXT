SYMPTOMS
========

When you play the MindMaze game in Encarta Encyclopedia, no background music
plays.

   - or -

When you go to the Collage section of Encarta 97, you do not hear any theme music
on a 68K Macintosh.

STATUS
======

This is by design. Encarta 97 is not designed to play background music in
MindMaze on any Macintosh. The program also does not play theme music in the
Collages on a non-Power Macintosh (680x0 processor).

Only Macintoshes with a PowerPC chip play music in the Collages.
