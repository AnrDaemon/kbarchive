TITLE   :XGEN: Exchange SP3 May Install on Servers Without SP2
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) may not correctly
detect whether or not the server it is being applied to has already had Service
Pack 2 (SP2) applied to it. The SP3 Update.exe proceeds with the installation,
without issuing a warning message that SP2 has not been correctly applied.

CAUSE
=====

If SP2 is removed from a Microsoft Exchange Server computer by clicking Remove
All from within the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program, not all registry
keys associated with this installation are removed. Specifically, the key that
stores the currently installed server and SP version information remains. If a
fresh copy of Microsoft Exchange Server is then installed on this Windows NT
Server, the SP3 Update.exe will not detect that this server has not had SP2
correctly applied to it, and the SP3 Update.exe proceeds without warning.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the server you are upgrading had an SP2 installation removed, make sure you
re-apply SP2 before applying SP3.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
