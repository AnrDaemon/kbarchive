TITLE   :SMS Trace and the SNMP Trap Receiver Log File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbsmsUtil smssnmp smsutil

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server Trace utility does not correctly display the
information in the Trapfltr.log file. Trapfltr.log does not follow the standard
syntax conventions for the Systems Management Server logs. As a result, the
Systems Management Server Trace utility may discard or improperly display log
file information.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use a text editor such as Notepad to open the
Trapfltr.log file. Note that Notepad only reads the log file once, upon opening.
In order to see updates, the file must be closed and reopened.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
