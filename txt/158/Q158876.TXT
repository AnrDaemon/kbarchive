This article describes how to remove the Welcome To Windows dialog box using the
Msbatch.inf file for batch installations of Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this article.
Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you proceed.

In the Msbatch.inf file, modify the [Install] section to include the following
line:

   addreg=remove.welcome

Also, add the following section and key:

   [remove.welcome]
   HKU,.default\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\explorer\

Note that the Welcome to Windows dialog box is displayed the first time Windows
starts.
