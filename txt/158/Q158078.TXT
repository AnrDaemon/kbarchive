TITLE   :Configuring an HP JetDirect EX Plus 3 Interface Card
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Hewlett-Packard (HP) JetDirect EX Plus 3 (multiple port) interface card
is incorrectly configured, all print jobs print to the first printer.

CAUSE
=====

This can be caused by having uppercase letters or spaces in the port name. These
cards are case-sensitive. If DLC protocol is used instead of TCP/IP, this will
also cause all jobs to go to only one printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Configure the printers to use TCP/IP instead of DLC.

 - When adding a Hewlett-Packard Network Port, in the Name box use only
   lowercase letters with no spaces. For example, use raw1, raw2, and raw3 or
   text1, text2, and text3.

   NOTE: The port names must have the sequential numeric value of 1, 2, 3 after
   the lowercase name in order for all three ports to be used.
