PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.0 4.1 4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDAOsearch kbDatabase kbMFC kbODBC kbVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Visual C++ Debugger found in Developer Studio in the Windows NT
environment, it is possible to see the following or similar messages, in the
Output window:

   

   LDR: Dll MSJINT32.DLL base 10000000 relocated due to collision with
        C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DAO\DAO3032.DLL

   

   LDR: Dll MSJTER32.DLL base 10000000 relocated due to collision with
        C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DAO\DAO3032.DLL

The actual names of the DLLs reported in this message may be different.

CAUSE
=====

MSJINT32.DLL, DAO3032.DLL, and MSJTER32.DLL all incorrectly use the same base
address.

RESOLUTION
==========

Typically, the impact on performance is minimal and these messages can be safely
ignored.


STATUS
======

The DAO components were corrected in Visual C++, version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The impact on performance can be minor or significant depending upon the load
other applications are placing on your system. Each time a DLL is relocated, the
fix-ups for that DLL have to be recalculated. This is performed internally
within the operating system and cannot be controlled by applications utilizing
these DLLs.
