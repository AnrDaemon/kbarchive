TITLE   :WD97: Cannot Use ScanProt with Word 97
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage word97

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Word 97, when you attempt to run the ScanProt macro virus protection tool,
you get one of the following error messages:

   Run-time error '548'
   Unable to create or edit macros using the WordBasic object.

   -or-

   Run-time error '438'
   Object doesn't support this property or method.

CAUSE
=====

When you open the ScanProt template, Word 97 automatically converts the ScanProt
macros to Microsoft Visual Basic code. After conversion, these macros no longer
work. They contain WordBasic macro commands that do not function in Visual Basic
for Applications.


RESOLUTION
==========

Word 97 has a built-in detection scheme that warns you when you are opening
documents or templates that contain macros. This process gives you the
opportunity to open the document or template with or without the macros. If you
suspect that a document or template contains macros that you do not want, you
can open the document or template without the macros.

When you convert document templates to Word 97 formatted files, Word
automatically converts all macros to Visual Basic code. During the conversion
process, Word 97 looks for specific ScanProt code in your Normal.dot file, and
if found, does not convert these macros.


Microsoft recommends that you install anti-virus software that is specifically
designed to detect Word macro viruses. Such software is available from several
third-party companies. For additional information virus protection software
