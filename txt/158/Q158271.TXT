TITLE   :SNA Windows 95 Client Not Support Windows NT Password Change
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use SNA Server version 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1) Windows 3.x client
software, and you connect to SNA Server over TCP/IP sockets, NetWare IPX/SPX, or
Banyan IP, you may experience the following problem.

The SNA Server Windows 95 client software does not support the ability to change
the Microsoft Windows NT password during SNA client logon. If the Windows NT
administrator has configured their Windows NT user accounts for User Must Change
Password at Next Logon, or if the user password has expired, the SNA Server
Windows 95 client will display the following error messages:

   SnaBase
   ERROR: Cound not open sponsor connection to <servername>
   Do you want to run the SNA Client configuration program ?

   ERROR: The SnaBase Service is not started.

NOTE: Many possible causes exist for a logon error besides a bad user ID,
password, domain, or expired password. Other possibilities include:

 - The user account has been disabled.

 - The user account has been locked out due to excessive failed logon attempts.

 - Restricted user logon hours has been defined.

 - The user must logon from a specific workstation.

 - The user is logging on using a trusted domain account and Windows NT is
   currently unable to contact a domain controller in the trusted domain.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Windows 95 client does not support the Windows NT password change
function.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do one of the following:

 - Use the Windows 95 Control Panel Password utility to change the user[ASCII
   146]s Windows NT password. This requires that the Windows 95 user is already
   logging into the Windows NT domain (for example, to the domain user account
   that has been assigned SNA Server resources) and his or her Windows 95
   computer is configured with the Microsoft Networking redirector.

 - Disable password expiration on the Windows NT account used by the SNA Server
   Windows 95 user.

 - Require the Windows NT administrator to reset the Windows NT account when the
   SNA Windows 95 client logon fails.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
2.11 and 2.11 Service Pack 1 Windows 95 client software. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
