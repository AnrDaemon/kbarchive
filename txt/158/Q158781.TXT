SUMMARY
=======

To determine which LANA numbers are being used on a Windows 95 client, type "net
diag /status" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt.

The resulting prompt asks you to enter the remote computer's NetBIOS name, or to
press ENTER to examine a local adapter's status. It then prompts you to select
the LANA number you want to use.

NOTE: You are prompted for a LANA number to use only if you are using more than
one protocol.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A NetBIOS-providing protocol set to be the default protocol is set to LANA 0. To
find out which protocol is on which LANA, check the following registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\NetTrans

Beneath this key is a series of \000x branches corresponding to the network
protocols installed. Skipping the NetBIOS-providing protocol set as the default
protocol, find the NetBIOS protocols being used and number their LANA numbers
backwards from seven.

Examples
--------

A Windows 95-based computer is using NetBIOS over IPX, TCP/IP, and NetBEUI. All
three are NetBIOS providers. NetBEUI has been set as the default protocol. The
NET DIAG /STATUS command shows:

   Please enter remote computer's NetBIOS name, or press ENTER to examine a
   local adapter's status.

   Please enter the LANA number you wish to use. Choose from the following
   NetBIOS-providing LANA(s): 0 6 7

The registry shows:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

\System
\CurrentControlSet
\Services
\Class
\NetTrans
\0000 - IPX/SPX
\0001 - NetBEUI
\0002 - TCP/IP
\0003 - NetBIOS over IPX
Using the above guidelines, you can determine that:

 - NetBEUI is on LANA 0 (default protocol)

 - NetBIOS over TCP/IP is on LANA 7

 - NetBIOS over IPX is on LANA 6

Note that IPX/SPX is skipped because it is not a NetBIOS-providing protocol. Had
NetBEUI not been set to be the default protocol, the NET DIAG /STATUS command
would not have listed LANA 0:

   Please enter the LANA number you wish to use. Choose from the following
   NetBIOS-providing LANA(s): 6 7

In this case, LANA numbers 6 and 7 are being used, and no NetBIOS- providing
protocol has been set as the default protocol. Otherwise, the display would show
LANA 0 being used.
