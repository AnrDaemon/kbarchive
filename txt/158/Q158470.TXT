the magnification of the document window and to display two pages:

      Sub SeeTwoPages()
         With ActiveWindow.View
            ' Switch to page layout view.
            .Type = wdPageView
            With .Zoom
               ' Set view to two pages wide.
               .PageColumns = 2
               ' Set view to one page high.
               .PageRows = 1
            End With
         End With
      End Sub
