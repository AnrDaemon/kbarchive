INSTALLING SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT SERVER 1.2 SERVICE PACK 4
-------------------------------------------------------

To install Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4, follow the steps below:

1. Create a new directory called SMS12SP4 (example directory) on a local
   workstation or your Primary Site Server.

2. Download SMS12SP4.EXE and copy it into the directory created in step 1.

3. From a Command Prompt, type the following command:

   C:\SMS12sp4> SMS12SP4.exe

4. You will be prompted to unzip to a folder. By default c:\temp is displayed.

5. Change the path and directory to that location specified in step 1 and choose
   unzip.

6. Message will be displayed that unzip was successful.

NOTE: The Service Pack 4 Setup program can not run from the same drive where SMS
has been installed. Steps 7-9 will work around this problem by sharing the
SMS12SP4 directory to a network drive and running Setup from the new drive.

7. Share the \SMS12SP4 directory. For example, to create a share called SMSUPGRD
   for C:\SMSUPGRD, use the following command:

   C:\> net share SMS12SP4=C:\SMS12SP4

8. Connect a network drive connection to the SMS12SP4 share. For example, to
   connect S: to share SMS12SP4: C:\> net use S: \\ServerName\SMS12SP4

9. Run Setup.CMD from the network drive connection. For example:

   C:\> S:
   S:\> setup.cmd
