SYMPTOMS
========

Special characters, such as the "smiley face" symbol or Greek characters, that
are included as part of a comment, may not appear in the ScreenTip even though
they are displayed correctly in the comment pane.

NOTE: The ScreenTip appears when you rest the pointer over the comment mark,
which is shaded with light yellow.

CAUSE
=====

The font selected for the ToolTip does not support this or similar characters.
To locate the font selected for the ToolTip, open the Display Properties dialog
box (Control Panel), and select the Appearance tab.

In Word, the Wingdings font is used to automatically render characters stored as
AutoCorrect entries when AutoFormat As You Type is turned on. Note that other
characters typed in other symbol fonts are rendered incorrectly in ScreenTips.

WORKAROUND
==========

To view all characters in a ScreenTip, avoid using symbol characters and use
characters supported by non-symbol fonts, such as Arial or Times New Roman.

NOTE: Not all characters that you insert using this workaround will appear
correctly in the ScreenTip. Some characters will appear correctly, some
characters will appear similar, and some characters will not appear at all.

To work around this problem, insert the character from the Symbol dialog box. For
example, the "sad face" character will appear as ":|" in the ScreenTip when you
use the following steps. (The "smiley face" character is not displayed in the
ScreenTip when you use this method.)

1. On the Insert menu, click Comment.

2. In the Comment pane, type the text you want.

3. On the Insert menu, click Symbol.

4. In the Font list, select Wingdings, click the "sad face" character, and then
   click Insert.

For other symbols, such as general punctuation, accented characters, and
letter-like symbols (for example, the trademark symbol), use the following
steps:

1. On the Insert menu, click Comment.

2. In the Comment pane, type the text you want.

3. On the Insert menu, click Symbol.

4. In the Font list, select (normal text), click the character you want, and
   then click Insert.
