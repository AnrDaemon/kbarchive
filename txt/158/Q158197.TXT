SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the ODBC API to bind input, output, and return
values to parameters of stored procedures. This is a workaround using the
rdoPreparedStatement object to accomplish this behavior.

RDO has problems binding parameters to an rdoPreparedStatement if your ODBC
driver does not correctly support the SQLDescribeParam and SQLProcedureColumns
functions. RDO depends on information returned from these functions to determine
the type, direction, and size of each parameter in a stored procedure. If any of
this information is missing or invalid, RDO fails with one of the following
error messages:

   Invalid parameter value

   or

   Illegal syntax or access violation

RDO generates the error the first time you access the rdoParameters collection
(check the Count property or try to get an item from it), because RDO calls
SQLDescribeParam or SQLProcedureColumns and attempts to build the parameters
collection at that time.

NOTE: RDO uses SQLProcedureColumns if the SQL uses the ODBC {Call} syntax and
SQLDescribeParam for all others, such as the proprietary Execute for SQL
Server.

One way to avoid this problem is to pass the input parameters to your stored
procedure "in-line," without using an rdoPreparedStatement. The following line
of code demonstrates this:

   Set rs = cn.OpenResultset("{call GetNames ('Jones')}")

NOTE: Oracle 7.2 cannot return a result set from a stored procedure.

In the case of this sample, a stored procedure named GetNames received one input
parameter with the value of "Jones," and should return a result set with each
row from the table that contained that value in a certain column. This works
fine for a stored procedure that only accepts input parameters, but it is not
useful for a stored procedure that returns output parameters or return values.

To work around this problem, a class module has been developed that uses the ODBC
API to call your parameterized stored procedure without the use of
SQLDescribeParam or SQLProcedureColumns. This class module does not have the
ability to return a result set from the stored procedure, but you can set
multiple input, output, and return values. This sample, Odbcbind.exe, is
available for download as a class module that you can include in your
application or compile into an OLE DLL.
