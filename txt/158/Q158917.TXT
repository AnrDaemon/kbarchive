SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to send a message using Windows Messaging, you may receive the
following error message:

   Microsoft Windows Messaging Subsystem
   The MAPI Spooler has shut down unexpectedly. Close all mail-enabled
   applications before attempting to log on again.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if the personal message store (.pst) file is damaged and
has a message stuck in the Outbox.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following steps:

1. Create a new Windows Messaging profile and a new .pst file. To do so, follow
   these steps:

   a. Use the right mouse button to click Inbox on the desktop, and then click
      Properties on the menu that appears.

   b. Click Show Profiles, and then click Add.

   c. Click the appropriate information services to add them to the profile.

   d. Type a name in the Profile Name box, and then click Next.

   e. Follow the instructions in any wizards that run to configure the
      information services.

   f. When you are prompted for the Personal Folders file, make sure to specify
      a new file name. For example, instead of Mailbox.pst, you could use
      Mailbox2.pst.

   g. Click Finish, and then click the new profile in the "When starting Windows
      Messaging, use this profile" box.

   h. Click Close.

2. Copy the messages from your original .pst file to the new .pst file. To do
   so, follow these steps:

   a. Start Windows Messaging, click Tools, and then click Services.

   b. Click Add, click Personal Folders, and then click OK.

   c. Locate the original .pst file, and then click Open.

   d. Click OK, and then click OK.

   e. Copy all of the messages from the original set of Personal Folders to the
      new Personal Folders, except for the Outbox.
