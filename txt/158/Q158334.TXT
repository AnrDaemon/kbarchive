SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot install any eariler version of PowerDesk 2.02/2.04 in Windows NT 4.0.
When you try to do so, an error message appears, but may vanish before you can
read it.

CAUSE

PowerDesk requires the Microsoft Windows 95 Kernel32.dll file. This file is not
included with Windows NT.

RESOLUTION

are garbled and some functions do not work as expected. Do not use PowerDesk
with Windows NT.
