======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Macintosh 
 - Microsoft Encarta 98 Encyclopedia for Macintosh 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Encarta 97, installation takes a very long time to
complete, or it does not complete.

CAUSE
=====

A virus protection program may be running while you are trying to install
Encarta.

RESOLUTION
==========

Turn off the virus protection program until you finish the installation.

To turn off virus protection, use the Extension Manager. You can also use a
similar program that allows you to selectively disable extensions and control
panels.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Virus detection programs may report errors when you try to install software
because they are loaded into memory and they monitor any changes to the system.
Sometimes the actions of a setup application make the virus detection program
think the setup application is a virus. For example, this can occur when the
installation software adds items to the System Folder, or changes preferences.
