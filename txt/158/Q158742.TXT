TITLE   :Cannot Open Halmps.dll
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The information in this article applies to the 
Korean version(s) of Windows NT Server.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply Service Pack 2 for Windows NT Server Hangul version 3.5, the user
receives the following message:

   Non-Critical Error which cannot open Halmps.dll and Ntkrnlmp.exe.

CAUSE
=====

Both of these files are not included in Service Pack 2, however, it can be found
on the Windows NT Server Korean version 3.5 CD in the i386 directory.
Halpmps.dll is the hardware abstraction layer for multiprocessor computers.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Copy both files to the existing Windows NT directory.

2. Reapply the service pack.

However, the files are actually not there in the specific directory (but found in
the Windows NT 3.5 U.S. Service Pack 2). This is a noncritical error and
apparently does not affect functionality.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Hangul version 3.5.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
