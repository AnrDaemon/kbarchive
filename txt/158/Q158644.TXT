TITLE   :SMS: Windows NT 4.0 Upgrade Job Repeats Continually
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork kbPCM smspcmkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT 4.0 unattended upgrade will continually cycle through the
installation process when sent as System Background task. Note that the upgrade
installs correctly, but the job repeats infinitely.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you run the upgrade as a System Background task and no
user is logged on to the computer. The Package Command Manager (PCM) service
fails to report a job completion status. Disabling this option will allow the
upgrade to complete successfully.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in System Management Server version
1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

The upgrade will be performed correctly, but once it is done, the upgrade will
start again. Sending the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack (as a System Background
task) works as expected, and does not display this problem.
