PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client is not supported connecting over
ShivaRemote (version 3.59) under OS/2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a remote solution is needed, it may be possible to use a third-party dial-up
networking program to connect the OS/2 computer to the network with the
Microsoft Exchange Server. Assuming Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communication is
supported over this remote connection, the Microsoft Exchange client should be
able to connect to the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server over the
existing slow link connection. Contact IBM for information about possible remote
solutions for the OS/2 operating system.
