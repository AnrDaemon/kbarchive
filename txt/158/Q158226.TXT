WORKAROUND
==========

There is no way to save your personal data in Encarta Encyclopedia. However, you
can copy your data into a word processor, spreadsheet, or any other text capable
application (i.e., Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, or Microsoft Exchange).

1. On the Personal Nutrition drop-down menu (the triangle pointing down, located
   in the upper left corner of the Personal Nutrition window), click Copy Data.

2. Open your word processor, spreadsheet, or other program.

3. On the Edit menu, click Paste to paste the copied data.
