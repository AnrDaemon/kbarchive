TITLE   :XGEN: Cannot Update When Only Exchange Administrator Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program and clear every check box
except Administration, only the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program
components will be installed. If you later try to update to Microsoft Exchange
Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) on this computer, the Service Pack
update will stop. The following error message appears:

   This version of Exchange Setup can only upgrade servers that are
   4.0a/SP2.Upgrade the server to 4.0a/SP2 and then run Setup again.

CAUSE
=====

When Microsoft Exchange Server is installed, entries are written to the registry
that identify build version information. When only the Administrator components
are installed, some of the entries are not written to the registry. Microsoft
Exchange Server 4.0 SP3 checks the version. Because some registry entries are
missing, Update for SP3 cannot determine the current version of Microsoft
Exchange Server and terminates.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add the missing entries to the registry. You can
update the registry using Regini.exe from the Windows NT Resource Kit.

The registry values that need to be added to the registry are:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup
   NewestBuild REG_DWORD  value = 0x3E1
   Build REG_DWORD  value = 0x345

1. Use the following script file with Regini.exe (from the Windows NT Resource
   Kit) to update the registry with the correct values. Copy the script commands
   below to a text file named Exch.ini.

   \registry\machine\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup
   NewestBuild=REG_DWORD 0x3E1
   Build=REG_DWORD 0x345

2. To have Regini.exe update the registry, carry out the following command:

   regini exch.ini

Note: This workaround assumes that Regini.exe is located in your path and
Exch.ini is in the current directory.
