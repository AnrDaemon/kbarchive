TITLE   :PRB: Cloaked Projects are Deployed
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Cloaking is a new feature in Visual SourceSafe 5.0 that excludes specified
subprojects from recursive actions on a higher level project. If the parent
project is a WEB project, when the project is DEPLOYed, the cloaking has no
effect.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. While cloaking is set by the individual user to
determine whether a given subproject will be included in a recursive GET or
CHECKOUT for that user only, deploying a project is a "universal" action that
affects an entire project, including all its subprojects.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Deploying a project is, in effect, identical to performing a recursive Get
Latest Version. Because the cloaking affects the behavior of the Get, you might
expect it to affect the Deploy in the same way.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a WEB project (the parent project) that has at least one subproject.

2. Mark one of the subprojects as Cloaked.

3. Deploy the parent project. Note that the subproject is also Deployed.
