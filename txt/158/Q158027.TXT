SUMMARY
=======

The following information is the enhancement codes for Hellbender. These
enhancement codes allow you to warp to different planets, boost your ship's
strength, make you invincible, or provide you with full weapons. The codes can
be used by typing the code name (without pressing ENTER) from within the
Hellbender game.

These codes are implemented for testing and support purposes only. They will be
leaked at an appropriate time after the product has been shipped to help create
excitement among gamers. The enhancement codes will not be enabled during
multiplayer games.

List of the enhancement codes and what they do:

Cheat Code     Effect
----------     ------

FRAMEIT        Displays a frame counter

TOTLPOWR       Makes main energy 100%

STEROID        Makes the player invincible

URDEAD#        The number (#) represents a number 0 - 9. These correspond
               to the weapon number a player pushes to get a particular
               weapon. This code will give the player the desired weapon
               as if they just picked up that weapon's power up.

               For example: URDEAD1 = Dispersion Cannon

URAGONR        Gives the player the secret weapon

MAXMEUP        Makes the hull 100 percent

IMPUMPD        Gives the player all weapons as if they picked up one
               power up of each weapon

AUNTEM#        This warps the player to the planet corresponding to
               the number entered at the end of the code.
               The numbers will be 1-8.

               For example, AUNTEM2 = Planet EYRIE

IMSTUCK        This skips the current mission and advances the player
               to the next mission.
