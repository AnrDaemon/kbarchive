======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the Microsoft Exchange Directory service fails to start, either because the
computer name has been changed or there is file corruption, you need to
determine the organization name, site name, and possibly the computer name. To
re-create the same machine configuration, you must determine the computer name.
To determine these names, you need to find the file called "Exchange Server
Setup.log," located in the root of the disk drive where the Microsoft Exchange
Server is installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine the organization, site, and computer name:

1. In the root directory of the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server,
   locate a file called "Exchange Server Setup.log."

2. Using Notepad or another text editor, search the log for the first occurrence
   of "Creating." This will display the organization, site, and computer name.
   Because the file is appended each time Setup is run, there may be multiple
   Setup details in the file.

3. To display the latest log, go to the bottom of the file and search upwards
   for the "Creating Object" line.

   In the "Creating Object" line, the organization, site, and computer names are
   displayed as shown below:

      /o=<Organization>/ou=<sitename>/cn=configuration/ 
      cn=servers/cn=<computername>

Additional query words: recreate dir.edb directory salvage
