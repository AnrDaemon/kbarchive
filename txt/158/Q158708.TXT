TITLE   :XCLN: Newprof Fails to Create a Profile
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Newprof.exe fails to create a profile if the command line path to the profile
descriptor file (.PRF) contains a space.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Find the 16-bit directory name for the directory with a space in its name. To
   find the 16-bit name, view the directory in File Manager.

2. Substitute the 16-bit directory name for the entry with a space after the -P
   switch.

   For example, instead of using the command line

   C:\EXCHANGE\NEWPROF.EXE -P c:\test newprof\default.prf

use:

   C:\EXCHANGE\NEWPROF.EXE -P c:\testne~1\default.prf

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The workaround described above is usually not a viable option if you are using
the variable %USERNAME% in a Windows NT login script to signify the directory
where the profile descriptor file is located and the path to the user's home
directory contains a space.
