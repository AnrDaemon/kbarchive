-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you update fields in a Word 97 document while tracking revisions, the page
number field does not appear as deleted and reinserted. For example, Word does
not display the page number twice, marked once for deletion (with strikethrough
formatting) and once for insertion (with underline formatting). Word places a
revision bar in the margin to indicate that it was updated. This behavior is
different from previous versions of Word, in which the page number is displayed
multiple times, once for each field update.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior was changed at the request of Word users.
