The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server Quick Windows Viewer will experience display
problems when you remotely control a client computer running Windows for
Workgroups IPX that has a Trident 8900d video card, if the client's color depth
is greater than 256 colors. The Quick Windows Viewer will display that client's
desktop as mostly black, although the icons may be visible.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reduce the color depth on the client computer to
256 colors or less.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
