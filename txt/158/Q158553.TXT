-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 96 Encyclopedia for Windows 
 - Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Windows 
 - Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 97 Deluxe for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Chemical formulas for simple or complex compounds in the Encarta Encyclopedia
dictionary are incorrect. Nearly all the compounds checked are incorrect.

For example, the chemical formula for Carbon Dioxide should be CO2 (with the 2
shown in subscript). The formula actually appears as CO, which is the formula
for Carbon Monoxide.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the 1996 and 1997 editions of
Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
