TITLE   :Re-creating Admin Shares Causes Exception Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you re-create administrative shares (ADMIN$, C$, D$) from Windows NT
version 4.0 Server Manager, a general protection fault occurs with the following
message:

   services.exe
   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x77f64bc3

CAUSE
=====

When you try to specify the permissions when re-creating the administrative
shares through Server Manager, it causes an access violation in services.exe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to reproduce the problem
------------------------------

1. Open Server Manager.

2. Select Shared Directories from the Computer drop down list on the option bar.

3. Stop sharing one of the admin shares (Admin$, C$, or D$).

4. Re-create the admin share and specify the permissions.

For example:

1. Select ADMIN$ and select Stop Sharing.

2. Click New Share, and put in ADMIN$ for the share name.

3. Click the Permissions key, remove Everyone, and add Administrators.

4. Click OK.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not set the permissions on the new administrative share. This problem does
not appear if you do not try to specify the permissions for the newly created
administrative share.

NOTE: This problem does not exist in Windows NT 3.51. If you specify the
permissions, Server Manager displays an informational pop-up window that
states:

   This has been shared for administrative purposes. The permissions cannot
   be set.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
