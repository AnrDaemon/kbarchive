TITLE   :Sage.dat Files Do Not Match When Compared After Backup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you compare files after performing a backup operation, the Sage.dat files
may not match.

CAUSE
=====

System Agent accesses this file when it runs an event (such as a check for low
disk space notification). If this occurs after the Sage.dat file is backed up,
but before the comparison is completed, the date and time stamps differ.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, disable System Agent before you perform a backup
operation. To disable System Agent, use the right mouse button to click the
System Agent icon on the taskbar, and then click Suspend System Agent on the
menu that appears.

When the backup operation is finished, activate System Agent again by using the
right mouse button to click the System Agent icon on the taskbar, and then
clicking Suspend System Agent on the menu that appears.
