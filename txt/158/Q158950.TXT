SYMPTOMS

If you have two ISA network adapters of the same model and type installed,

1. During Setup, after the first adapter is detected, click Next to view the
   settings for the first network adapter.

2. Click Find Next. This should display the settings for the second network
   adapter and allow you to install it.

-or-

After Setup is finished, use the Network tool in Control Panel to manually add
the second adapter.
