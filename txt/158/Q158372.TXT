TITLE   :Black Screen During Windows NT 4.0 Upgrade on DEC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform an upgrade to Windows NT 4.0 on a DEC PC XL 590 computer with a
Diamond Viper 9000 video card, the screen may go black when the computer
switches from text mode to graphical mode during Setup.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if you initiate the upgrade with the /B switch.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Install Windows NT 4.0 again. Install Windows NT into a folder other than the
   one that currently contains Windows NT.

 - Do not use the /B switch. Run Setup using the three boot floppy disks.
