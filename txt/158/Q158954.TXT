TITLE   :Fd8xx.sys Times Out Repeatedly with Quantum xp32150
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Quantum xp32150 SCSI hard disk with a Future Domain
8xx-series SCSI controller, Fd8xx.sys times out repeatedly. The system may pause
and application error messages may occur.

CAUSE
=====

An incompatibility exists between the Quantum xp32150 hard disk and the Future
Domain 8xx-series controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

Removing the xp32150 hard disk from the SCSI bus prevents the timeouts from
occurring.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Windows NT is installed on the Quantum hard disk, frequent timeouts can
result. A demonstration of the timeouts can be performed by running Disk
Administrator and attempting to detect tape devices at the same time. This can
cause the system to pause for up to 10 seconds.
