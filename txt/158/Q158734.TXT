SUMMARY
=======

Execute.exe is used to run a two-phase Setup program under the Package Command
Manager (PCM) program of SMS. A two-phase Setup is one that is actually two
different programs; the first program starts the second one, and then it stops
itself. When the first program ends, PCM severs its network connection, leaving
the second program without a network connection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Execute.exe runs the command-line for a Windows program, and then polls for its
end. When it ends, it temporarily pauses, and waits until no window possessing a
given window title and window class can be found. Use the Spy.exe program
(distributed with Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5) to determine the Window class and
title for the second phase of a Setup application.

The Execute.exe program must reside in either the root directory of the package
share, or the logon server MSTEST directory (logon.srv\MSTEST).

NOTE: Execute is only for 16-bit applications running under Windows 3.1, Windows
NT, or Windows 95.

The syntax of Execute.exe is:

      Execute.exe "command_line" "window_caption" "window_classname"

where:

 - Command_line is the command line to be executed.

 - Window_caption is the string to appear in the title bar of the window running
   command_line.

 - Window_classname is the name of a window class.

Either or both of window_caption or window_classname may be blank by specifying
an empty double quote string (""). Do not omit the quotes even if they are
empty; the double quotes around each parameter are required syntax.

The following lines are examples of Execute.exe:

      Execute "Setup.exe /B4" "Microsoft PowerPoint" "PPApplicationClass"

   -or-

      Execute "Setup.exe /B4" "" "PPApplicationClass"
