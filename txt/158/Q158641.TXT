PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbualink97

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view your document in online layout view and the document contains a
large watermark (picture), the line spacing appears greater at the bottom of the
watermark.

CAUSE
=====

Word resizes the watermark such that it is displayed incorrectly in online
layout view.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, insert a picture in the background. Word will
automatically resize the picture so that it is displayed properly in online
layout view.

NOTE: When you insert a picture using these steps, the picture will appear only
in online layout view. It will not be printed nor displayed in page layout or
print preview.

To insert a picture in the background, use the following steps:

1. On the View menu, click Online Layout.

2. On the Format menu, point to Background, and then click Fill Effects.

3. On the Picture tab, click Select Picture. Select the picture you want to use
   and click OK.

4. Click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Online layout view is a new feature in Word 97 that optimizes the layout of your
document to make online reading easier. For example, text appears larger and
wraps to fit the window. Online layout view does not display the document as it
will look when printed.
