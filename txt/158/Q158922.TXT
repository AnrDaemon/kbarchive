KEYWORDS:osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Add New Hardware Wizard, it may not detect a device that has
been removed in Device Manager on a multiple-profile user system.

CAUSE
=====

Removing a Plug and Play device from one profile and leaving it in another
causes a flag to be set in the registry to prevent the device from being
enumerated on the next startup, and may also cause the Add New Hardware Wizard
to bypass the device. The flag exists only in the profile in which the device
was removed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem from occurring, disable the device in Device Manager
instead of removing it. To disable a device, click the Disable In This Hardware
Profile check box for the device in Device Manager.

To restore (or redetect) the device, remove it from all profiles and then run the
Add New Hardware Wizard.
