SUMMARY
=======

When you set the Site Properties Clients to automatically start the Remote
Troubleshooting component, you may observe different behaviors, depending on the
operating system the client is running. The following list shows the observed
behavior for different operating systems:

 - MS-DOS clients: USERTSR and USERIPX are installed and placed in the
   Autoexec.bat file, to be started automatically when the computer starts.

 - Windows 3.1 and 3.11 clients: USERTSR and USERIPX are installed and started
   automatically from the Autoexec.bat file. WUSER is installed, but must be
   started manually, regardless of the 'automatically start this component'
   setting.

 - Windows for Workgroups clients: USERTSR is not loaded. If the client is a
   NetWare client, USERIPX is started automatically. WUSER is not started
   automatically, regardless of the 'automatically start this component'
   setting.

 - Windows 95 clients: USERTSR and USERIPX are not loaded. WUSER is installed,
   but must be started manually.

 - Windows NT clients: The Remote Control Agent service is installed and started
   automatically, regardless of the 'automatically start this component'
   setting.
