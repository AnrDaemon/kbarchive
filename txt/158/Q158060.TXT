PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97; :Service Release 1 (SR-1)
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbother kbdta kbconversion kbdtacode word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, version Service Release 1 (SR-1) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a Word 97 document that contains Visual Basic code in another
document format, such as Rich-Text Format (RTF), the Visual Basic code is lost.

NOTE: In the version of Microsoft Word 97 prior to Service Release 1 (SR-1), Word
does not display a warning dialog box that macros will be lost when you save to
another document format.

In Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1), a warning appears as follows:

   All macros in this document will be lost if the document is saved in
   <Selected Document Format>. Do you want to save in this format anyway?


CAUSE
=====

None of the converters that ship with Word 97 supports the conversion of Visual
Basic code. If you need to save a document in a format other than Word 97, make
sure you have a backup copy of your Word 97 document before you convert it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
