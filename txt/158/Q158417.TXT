The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 2.0, 2.5 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you install MSN, The Microsoft Network, the cache files for some shows may
not be installed on computers that use real-mode drivers for the CD-ROM drive.
This causes longer download times when first viewing shows and content on MSN.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The show files on the MSN CD-ROM use long file names. CD-ROM drives that use
real-mode drivers cannot view long file names and do not install the show files.
This has no adverse effect on installing other MSN program files.

You can work around this problem by using Windows 95 drivers, if available, for
the CD-ROM drive.
