TITLE   :SAS Window: Winlogon.exe Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbsetup kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows NT and you log on, the following error message may
appear:

   Error: SAS Window: Winlogon.exe
   There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive A:

CAUSE
=====

Systems that have bootable CD-ROMs and Award BIOS with a date code prior to
September 25, 1996 may experience this problem. The Award BIOSes with release
dates prior to September 25, 1996 enable bootable CD-ROM support by using floppy
and hard disk emulation. Windows NT 4.0 does not support emulation mode CD-ROM
booting.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable the bootable CD-ROM functionality of the system BIOS or of the SCSI
controller BIOS.

To disable the bootable CD-ROM support of the Award BIOS:

1. Restart the system.

2. Press the DEL key to enter the BIOS Setup menu.

3. Move the cursor to BIOS Feature Setup and press the Enter key.

4. Click BOOT Sequence.

5. Change the boot sequence so that the CD-ROM appears after the hard disk
   drive.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
