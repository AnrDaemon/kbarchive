 - Microsoft GEX, version 1.0

SYMPTOMS
========

GEX may stop responding (hang) if you do not have your system configured
correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

If GEX hangs, make sure your computer is at least a Pentium 75 with a minimum of
8 MB of RAM. Running GEX on a computer with a lower configuration may result in
hardware and performance difficulties.

2. Clear the Sound Effects check box.
