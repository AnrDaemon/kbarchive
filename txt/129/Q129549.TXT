You can use the Windows NT Server Tools Event Viewer under Windows 3.1 or
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 to view security events of a remote Windows NT
computer. If you don't have administrative rights and you attempt to view the
security log in Event Viewer, the following description appears for each event:

   found. It contains the following insertion string(s): <Strings vary for
   each Event ID number>.

where <xxx> is a specific Event ID number.

3.11 user administrative rights.
