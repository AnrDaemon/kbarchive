TITLE   :FoxPro Obtains Exclusive Open on Shared Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under Windows NT 3.5, Microsoft FoxPro can obtain an exclusive open of a DBF
file when it should be denied access.

CAUSE
=====

When a FoxPro database file is stored on a Netware Server, and accessed from a
Windows NT Workstation or Server, it is possible to obtain an exclusive open of
the file when it is not appropriate. The attributes of the DBF file must be set
to R, W and S (read, write, and share) for this to occur. Deleting the DBF file
S attribute prevents the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
