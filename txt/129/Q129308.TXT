TITLE   :PRB: Pivot Table in Excel Does Not Update
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a Pivot Table in Microsoft Excel using Visual FoxPro's Pivot Table
Wizard and then change the data in the table on which the Pivot table is based,
the Excel Pivot Table does not update to reflect the change in the underlying
data.

RESOLUTION
==========

To update the data, right click any cell in the Pivot Table in Excel. Then
choose Refresh Data from the context sensitive menu.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design because of performance issues associated with
Microsoft Query having to retrieve data from a FoxPro table in Excel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FoxPro ODBC driver passes data to Microsoft Query. Excel then retrieves the
data from Microsoft Query. For the data to be automatically updated in the Pivot
Table, FoxPro would have to notify Microsoft Query every time data changes in a
table on which a Pivot Table is based.

Additional query words: VFoxWin 3.00
