TITLE   :PRB: Clicking a Tab Does Not Activate Page in a Tabbed Dialog
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a page in a tabbed dialog, the caption of the Tab becomes bold.
However, the page is not activated until the mouse button is released.

CAUSE
=====

The page is activated in a two-step process. It becomes active when the mouse is
released, which is when the MouseUp event occurs. This design provides
flexibility by allowing users to drag the mouse off without selecting the tab.

WORKAROUND
==========

If, as with tabbed dialogs in Microsoft Excel and Word for Windows, you want to
activate a page as soon as you click the tab, you can trap for the MouseDown
event on the page frame. Then locate the position of the mouse in relation to
the pageframe, and activate the correct page by setting the ACTIVEPAGE property
of the page frame to the desired page.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
