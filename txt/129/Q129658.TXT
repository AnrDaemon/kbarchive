SUMMARY
=======

Windows applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, read and write
metafiles in a format known as Aldus Placeable Format. This format is
incompatible with the Windows GetMetaFile(), CopyMetaFile(), and PlayMetaFile()
functions. This incompatibility occurs because placeable metafiles begin with a
22-byte header.

Sample code is available in the Microsoft Download Center that you can use to
read and write these placeable metafiles.
