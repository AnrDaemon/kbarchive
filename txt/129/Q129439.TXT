TITLE   :PRB: Connection Designer Doesn't Have OK or Cancel Buttons
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Connection Designer does not have an OK or Cancel button. You can open the
Connection Designer by typing CREATE CONNECTION or selecting the Connection
Designer from the New File dialog.

CAUSE
=====

The Connection Designer is a designer. It is not a dialog box, but a modeless
window, so just like the Form Designer, it does not include an OK or Cancel
button.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can save a connection by selecting File Save As, and you can cancel it by
closing the window without saving changes.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Connection Designer provides an interface to create a connection to use with
views. Connections are saved in a database. For more information about the
Connection Designer, search for the "Connection Designer" topic in the Visual
FoxPro Help menu.
