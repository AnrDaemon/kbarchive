MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
contains specific information for working around problems.

Disk 3 Doesn't Work with Windows
--------------------------------

Three floppy disks are included with "Microsoft Word 6 Resource Kit," second
edition. Although disks 1 and 2 install correctly on your Windows- based
computer, disk 3 is for the Macintosh and cannot be recognized as a formatted
disk by a Windows-based system.

Correction:

The disk labels for all three floppy disks should be changed as follows:

 - Disk 1: Change "Disk 1 of 3" to "Disk 1 for the PC"

 - Disk 2: Change "Disk 2 of 3" to "Disk 2 for the PC"

 - Disk 3: Change "Disk 3 of 3" to "Disk 1 for the Mac"

Comments:

Only the first two disks are formatted for Windows. The third disk is only for
Macintosh computers, and you should not attempt to install it on a Windows-based
machine.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
