SYMPTOMS
========

You are not able to log on to a Windows NT domain from a client computer after
you have changed the computer name.

RESOLUTION
==========

From Server Manager for Domains on the domain controller, delete and re- create
the computer name and then synchronize the entire domain.

Occasionally, after doing this, when you next attempt to log on, the following
error message appears:

   System can not log you on to the domain because the systems computer account
   in its primary domain is missing or the password on that account is
   incorrect.

If you receive this error message, follow these steps:

1. On the client, in the Network component of Control Panel, configure the
   computer to be a member of a new workgroup. You can use any workgroup name
   other than the domain name.

2. Using Server Manager for Domains on the domain controller, delete and
   re-create the computer name.

3. On the client, re-configure the computer to be a member of the domain again.
