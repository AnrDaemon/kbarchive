OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you check the details of an user name in Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows,
the following error message may be displayed:

   Address is no longer valid. User or PO no longer exists.

All mail sent to this user name will be returned with the following error in the
body of the message:

   The recipient has been deleted or has no email address.

CAUSE
=====

The address list contains invalid extended information. The invalid information
consists of default template fields associated with a postoffice other than on
the one where the user's account resides. This condition can occur if customized
user template *.TPL files are present on the remote user's workstation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the latest version of MSRMTUI.DLL and manually update your address lists
per the instructions included with the MSRMTUI.EXE self-extracting file on the
Microsoft Software Library. The updated MSRMTUI.DLL file provided in this update
will prevent the customized user template *.TPL files from being copied to the
remote user's workstation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows. This problem was corrected in MSRMTUI.DLL version
3.2.0.4001. If you do not have version 3.2.0.4001 (or later), you can find
