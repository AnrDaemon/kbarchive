SYMPTOMS

When you run Remote Control from a server that has a Tseng ET-4000 SVGA video
card to a client computer that has an ATI Mach 32 video card, the Quick Windows
Viewer color mappings are displayed poorly -- gray-whites appear as yellow.

This problem occurs when the Tseng ET-4000 SVGA video card is running at 1024x768
with 256 colors, and the ATI MACH 32 video card is running at 1024x768 with 16
colors.

STATUS
