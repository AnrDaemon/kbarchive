TITLE   :Piping Text Files Using RSH Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can use the RSH command to pipe a text file as input to a remote command and
execute it on a remote host. For example, the following command sends the
<file name>.TXT to the remote host, which lists the file contents and
displays the output on the local computer:

   type <file name>.TXT | RSH <host name> more

When you do this under Windows NT version 3.5, the file contents are not
displayed and the following error message appears:

   Terminal read: The pipe has been ended.

NOTE: In certain circumstances, Windows NT sends an empty file as input for the
remote command.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use another command such as RCP to remotely copy
the file and then use it as input for the remote command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
