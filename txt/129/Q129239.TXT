TITLE   :SMTP: Err Msg: Warning SMTP Output Retry Count Exceeded...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message sometimes appears in the SMTPGATE.LOG file:

   Warning SMTP output retry count exceeded saving to m:\SMTP\outbad.api

CAUSE
=====

Once an outgoing message is detected by the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, the
gateway then tries to connect to the UNIX Smarthost to send the message. By
default, the gateway will try 180 times before timing out. Once it has timed
out, it will write the above error message into the SMTPGATE.LOG file. Then it
will save the message in the M:\SMTP\OUTBAD.API file.

RESOLUTION
==========

This error usually indicates that there is something wrong with either the
network or the UNIX Smarthost. Use a Ping or Telnet command to ensure that the
UNIX Smarthost is up and running. Also check that the SMTP Deamon is running on
the UNIX Smarthost. If the error occurs frequently, check the network with a
protocol analyzer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the -Q command-line option to change the default of 180 times that
the gateway will try to connect to the UNIX Smarthost. For more information on
the -Q option, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
