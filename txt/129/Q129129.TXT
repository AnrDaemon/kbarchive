PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to change the string value of the sysContact, sysName, and
sysLocation objects using an SNMP manager (such as the Hewlett Packard
OpenView), the following error message appears:

   SNMP error - sysContact read only (OV3122)

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT 3.5 SNMP agent only allows read access for the sysContact,
sysName, and sysLocation objects. According to Internet MIB-II definition in RFC
1158, these SNMP objects should allow read and write access as follows:

   sysContact  OBJECT-TYPE

               SYNTAX  DisplayString (SIZE (0..255))
               ACCESS  read-write
               STATUS  mandatory
               DESCRIPTION
               "The textual identification of the contact person for this
               managed node, together with information how to contact this
               person."
               ::= { system 4 }

   sysName     OBJECT-TYPE

               SYNTAX  DisplayString (SIZE (0..255))
               ACCESS  read-write
               STATUS  mandatory
               DESCRIPTION
               "An administratively-assigned name for this managed node.
               By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain
               name."
               ::= { system 5 }

   sysLocation OBJECT-TYPE

               SYNTAX  DisplayString (SIZE (0..255))
               ACCESS  read-write
               STATUS  mandatory
               DESCRIPTION
               "The physical location of this node (e.g., 'telephone
               closet, 3rd floor')."
               ::= { system 6 }
