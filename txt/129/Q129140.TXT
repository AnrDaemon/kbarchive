TITLE   :SMTP: Gateway Hangs While Processing Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Gateway to SMTP hangs in the middle of processing a message.

CAUSE
=====

The Cisco Systems IGS router needs Firmware version 9.0.2 or later for SMTP mail
to move correctly. The IGS is a model of the Cisco Systems router. If a previous
version of the firmware for this model is used, the Microsoft Mail Gateway to
SMTP processes until the message is sent through the gateway to the router and
then hangs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable mail to flow correctly through the gateway, update the firmware on the
IGS Cisco Systems router. Once the firmware is updated, mail will be processed
correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMTPGATE.LOG file will contain a portion that resembles the following:

   :
   :
   :
   [tx] MAIL FROM:<user1@company1.com>
   [rx] 250 <user1@company1.coml>... Sender ok
   [tx] RCPT TO:<user2@company2.com>
   [rx] 250 <user2@company2.com>... Recipient ok
   [tx] DATA
   [rx] 354 Enter mail, end with "." on a line by itself
   [tx] ...message body...

After this, the gateway hangs.
