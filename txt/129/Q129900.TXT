TITLE   :PC Win: Can Not Store Folders Separate from MMF
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The "User's Guide" for Microsoft Mail Windows and Presentation Manager states
the following on page 29:

   You can store your messages in folders that you keep on your hard disk or on
   the postoffice. Folders kept on your hard disk are private, whereas folders
   kept on your postoffice can be private or shared with other users on your
   postoffice.

This incorrectly implies that you can store private folders on your local hard
drive separate from the Mail message file(MMF).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Shared Folders
--------------

Shared folders created with the Windows client will always be stored on the
postoffice. You cannot store shared folders on your local hard drive.

Private Folders
---------------

Private folders are always stored inside the MMF. If your MMF is stored on the
postoffice, your private folders will be kept inside the MMF on the postoffice.
If your MMF is stored on your hard disk, your private folders will be stored
inside your local MMF.

You cannot store your private folders outside of your MMF; therefore, you cannot
choose where your private folders will be stored independently of the MMF.
