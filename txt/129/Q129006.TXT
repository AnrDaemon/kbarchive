The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HP-PCL printer drivers included with Windows NT 3.1 and 3.5 always
command the print device to send output to the top tray (the default). This
feature is not configurable. The command overrides the print device's front-
panel configuration, so there is no way to force output to the lower
(rear)tray using these versions of Windows NT.

In Windows NT 3.51, the HP-PCL printer driver no longer sends an output
tray command, so the device's front-panel configuration can be used. For
example, if you configure the print device using it's front panel to use
the lower output tray, a Windows NT print job will not override this
setting, and the output will go to the lower tray. However, there is no way
to specify the output tray through the printer driver's user interface in
Print Manager. This feature is being considered for future releases of the
driver.
