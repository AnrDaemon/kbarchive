TITLE   :PRB: "Syntax Error" When Using the GETDIR() Function
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Calling the GETDIR() function returns a "Syntax Error" in Visual FoxPro version
3.0. It did not return any error in FoxPro for versions 2.x for Windows.

CAUSE
=====

Three parameters are used when the GETDIR() function is called. For example, if
the following command is issued, the "Syntax Error" message is displayed:

     cnewdir=GETDIR("","Save to:","Save")

Although this syntax was incorrect in previous versions of FoxPro, an error
message was not returned. The GETDIR() function accepts only two parameters.

WORKAROUND
==========

Correct the command to use only two parameters:

      cnewdir=GETDIR("","Save to:")

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
