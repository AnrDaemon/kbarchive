The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Mail Multitasking MTA (MMTA) for OS/2, running OS/2 version 1.3, is limited
to 16 megabytes of memory. However, the MMTA running under Microsoft Windows NT
can use all available memory on the Windows NT machine.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some of the memory management limitations of OS/2 1.x are removed. The most
important of these is the limit of 16 MB of physical RAM. The OS/2 subsystem
uses the large memory capability of Windows NT. As a result, you get an increase
in performance, and the applications can use the additional memory.

Protection Model
----------------

The OS/2 subsystem implements protection between OS/2 applications. It constructs
their address spaces (both the flat address space and LDTs) and implements the
same protection as in OS/2.

Segment Swapping
----------------

The OS/2 subsystem uses the Windows NT paging mechanism; no segment swapping is
performed. Paging works better than segment swapping, and it exists in OS/2 only
to support the 80286 processor, which is not supported in Windows NT.
