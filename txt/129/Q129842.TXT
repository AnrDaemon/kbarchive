KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

The NBF (NetBEUI) transport uses SendPacketPoolSize and ReceivePacketPoolSize
parameters to limit the maximum number of send and receive packets it
dynamically allocates. If send and receive packet exhausted errors occur
frequently, you may need to increment the values of these parameters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Receive packets are used by NBF to handle the incoming frames. Send packets are
used for connection oriented data. SendPacketPoolSize and ReceivePacketPoolSize
control the maximum number of send and receive packets NBF can allocate at one
time. The default value of SendPacketPoolSize is 100 and the default value of
ReceivePacketPoolSize is 30.

Under normal load, these parameters do not need to be changed. In some cases,
these parameters need to be adjusted. For example, too many reads and writes are
carried out by client workstations, and you need to optimize network throughput.
You may also want to change these parameters if a workstation cannot connect to
a server when the network is under heavy load.

To see if the values of these two parameters need to be modified:

1. Run Performance Monitor.

2. Choose NetBEUI Resource.

   The followig three counters are available in the Counter list box:

      Times Exhausted
      Used Average
      Used Maximum

   The Instance list box shows counters for each net board installed.

3. To see the number of times ReceivePackets exhausted, select Times exhausted
   in the Counter list box and \Device\NbfAdopter ==>Receive Packet (23).

To add or modify the SendPacketPoolSize or ReceivePacketPoolSize parameters:

The following details steps to take to add /modify the WARNING: Using Registry
Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide problems that may require you
to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any
problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool
at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

      \Services\NBF\Parameters 

3. If the SendPacketPoolSize or ReceivePacketPoolSize key exists, choose Edit
   Value from the Edit menu and change the value as needed.

4. If the SendPacketPoolSize or ReceivePacketPoolSize key does not exist, choose
   Add Key from the Edit menu and add the following information:

      Value Name: SendPacketPoolSize
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
      Value:      Insert the desired value
