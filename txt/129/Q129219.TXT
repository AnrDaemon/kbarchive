TITLE   :PC-NFSpro 1.1 Not Supported in Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot install PC-NFSpro 1.1 from Sun Microsystems in Windows 95. If you
were running PC-NFSpro before you installed Windows 95, you can no longer run
PC-NFSpro after installing Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

The .INF file included with PC-NFSpro 1.1 (OEM_NFSW.INF) is not in the correct
format for a Windows 95 OEMSETUP.INF file. Therefore, Windows 95 cannot install
PC-NFSpro as an additional network client.

In addition, PC-NFSpro is not a supported network in Windows 95. Windows 95 does
not have the ability to detect the presence of this network during Setup. When
you install Windows 95 over an installation of Windows for Workgroups 3.x with
PC-NFSpro 1.1 installed as a primary or secondary network, Windows 95 does not
recognize PC-NFSpro as an installed network, essentially disabling PC-NFSpro.

RESOLUTION
==========

Call Sun Microsystems and obtain part number #102467-01. This is an updated
PC-NFSpro .INF file.

STATUS
======

This situation is most likely caused by design changes in Windows 95. Microsoft
has confirmed that it is not caused by a problem in Windows 95. For more
information about resolving this issue, please contact Sun Microsystems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PC-NFSpro is manufactured by Sun Microsystems, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
