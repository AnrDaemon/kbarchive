PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error may occur in the event log when you attempt to authenticate
with a third party PPP server using MD5 authentication:

   Event ID 20066
   General named pipe failure occurred in the Point to Point Protocol engine.

   Data is 6 Hex.

CAUSE
=====

Code specific to Microsoft CHAP (MD4) is being executed regardless of the
authentication type. This code verifies that password length does not exceed the
14 character password length allowed in Microsoft networking. The password
length for MD5 authentication may exceed 14 characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.

NOTE: Microsoft Windows NT U.S. Service Pack 2 must be installed before you
install this fix. If it is not, RASPHONE will fail.
