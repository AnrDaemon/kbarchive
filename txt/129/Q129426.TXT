PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

One of the following error messages appears when you use a MultiTech MT2834
modem with the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Remote Access Service (RAS)
software:

   Error 652 Unrecognized Text Response: <h86><h9E>]<h86>

   -or-

   Error 652 Unrecognized Text Response:
   <h1C><h00><h00><h00><h00>...

NOTE: You may see a different response string other than the two noted above.

This error message appears if you have enabled callback for the account used to
dial-in to the RAS server. If you connect to the RAS server without callback
enabled, no error messages appear.

Increasing the CALLBACKTIME parameter in MODEM.INF does not solve the problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not enable callback for your RAS account if you
are using a MultiTech MT2834 modem. If you need to have callback enabled, use a
different modem, or use Windows NT 3.5 RAS as your RAS client software.
