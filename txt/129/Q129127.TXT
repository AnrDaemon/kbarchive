The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11a 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

File transfers to a computer running Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and TCP/IP- 32
may take a long time.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the TCP Receive window size shrinks down to 1460
bytes, which is equal to the TCP segment size. It takes the Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 client approximately 200 milliseconds to send an acknowledgment
(ACK).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows
for Workgroups, version 3.11a. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
