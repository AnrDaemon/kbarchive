The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Mail for Windows, when you add a gateway address to your Personal
Address Book, the following error may occur:

   A TPL file is missing from your server - contact your administrator.

NOTE: To select the Address Book, do the following:

1. From the Mail menu, choose Address Book.

2. Click the Custom Address icon. (It looks like a note card.)

3. Select the desired gateway, and click OK.

CAUSE
=====

The TPL file that corresponds with the selected gateway is either missing from
the TPL directory on the postoffice or is damaged. Each gateway has a
corresponding TPL file; for example, the SMTP gateway has a SMTP.TPL file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restore the correct TPL file from another postoffice, the original installation
diskettes, or a backup of your postoffice.
