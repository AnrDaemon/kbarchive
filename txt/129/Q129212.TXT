TITLE   :Problems Using Diamond Viper VLB Video Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows 95 on a computer with a Diamond Viper VLB video card
and the Diamond Windows 3.1 video drivers, you may experience one or more of the
following problems:

 - 16-color VGA is the only resolution listed.

 - You can use only one setting. For example, you can use only the 640 x 480 x
   256 setting.

 - When you restart Windows 95 you receive an error messages stating that the
   display adapter is not configured properly.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 does not detect the Diamond Viper VLB video card (with the Weitek
P9000 chip set), so it installs the standard VGA adapter driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are Diamond-supplied Beta 32-bit video drivers on the Windows 95 CD-ROM in
the Drivers\Display\Diamond folder. Please note that these are Beta drivers, and
may not function correctly with all hardware. If you have the floppy disk
version of Windows 95, you can obtain these drivers from Diamond directly. For
information about obtaining these drivers from Diamond, please see the Viper.txt
file.

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System icon.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

4. Double-click Display Adapters, click Standard Display Adapter (VGA), then
   click the Remove button.

   NOTE: Do not restart your computer when you are prompted to do so.

5. Double-click the Add New Hardware icon in Control Panel.

6. Click Next, click the No button to select it, and then click Next.

7. Click Display Adapters in the Hardware Types list, and then click Next.

8. Click Have Disk, select the Drivers\Display\Diamond folder on the Windows 95
   CD-ROM, and then install the appropriate Diamond Viper driver for your video
   adapter.

9. Shut down and restart your computer.

   NOTE: You still need a Viper.ini file (created by Vprmode.exe) stored in the
   C:\Viper folder or another location referenced by the "Set ViperPath="
   statement in the Autoexec.bat file. After installing these beta drivers, you
   cannot use the Windows 3.1 Diamond Install tool in Control Panel. It will
   cause a general protection fault.

MORE INFORMATION
================


After you remove the standard VGA adapter from Device Manager, you must use the
Add New Hardware tool in Control Panel to add a new video adapter if you replace
the Diamond Viper card.
