TITLE   :PC MMTA: Err Msg: Mail Bag Is Locked by: F:P1\<hex>.0LK
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the OS/2 Multitasking MTA (MMTA) is used with BW-Connect NFS for Windows
NT, it does not deliver mail between postoffices that reside on a UNIX machine.
If the MMTA parameters "Q123" are used, the following error will occur in the
SESSION.LOG:

   Mail bag is locked by: F:P1\<hex>.0LK

CAUSE
=====

Mail is not delivered because files on a UNIX system are written in lower case.
The Microsoft Mail OS/2 MMTA expects \P1\<prefix>.0LK files to be in upper
case. Specifically, the semaphore file is thought to be from another instance of
External when it differs from the upper case .0LK files. As a result, mail is
not dispatched.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, from Program Manager Main group, run the Control Panel.
Select Network, Beame & Whiteside NFS Client, and Configure. From the
Default Links category, choose either Upper Case or Preserve Case.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Multitasking MTA. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.20 MTA Beam
