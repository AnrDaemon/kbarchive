When you try to drag a message from Microsoft Exchange to a printer, the mouse
pointer changes to the "Unavailable" pointer while it is on top of the printer,
and you cannot print the message.

CAUSE

The Microsoft Exchange message document type is not supported for direct drag
and drop printing in Windows 95.

To print the message, use the Print option on the File menu, or save the message
to the desktop and drag it to the printer.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange version
