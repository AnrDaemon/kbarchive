-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for CListBox::SelItemRange says that it can be used to select
one or more items in a CListBox. This is not correct. SelItemRange can only be
used to select two or more items. This is because CListBox::SelItemRange uses
the windows message LB_SELITEMRANGEEX which deselects the item if the first and
last index of the range are equal.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here are two possible ways to enable the ability to select one or more items:

 - Test for the condition when the first and last items are equal, and in that
   case, use CListBox::SetSel.

-or-

 - Use the windows message LB_SELITEMRANGE. The following code fragment
   demonstrates how to use this message. The code works when CMyListBox is
   derived from CListBox.

Sample Code
-----------

   int CMyListBox::MySelItemRange (BOOL bSelect,
                                   int nFirstItem,
                                   int nLastItem)
   {
      ASSERT_VALID(this);
      return (int)SendMessage(LB_SELITEMRANGE,
                                 bSelect,
                                 MAKELPARAM(nFirstItem,nLastItem));
   }

NOTE: This problem was fixed in Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version
4.0. The following is from the Visual C++ 4.0 Books On-Line entry for
CListBox::SelItemRange:

   Selects multiple consecutive items in a multiple-selection list box.

   Use this member function only with multiple-selection list boxes. If you need
   to select only one item in a multiple-selection list box that is, if
   nFirstIem is equal to nLastItem call the SetSel member function instead.
