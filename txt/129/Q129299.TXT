TITLE   :Setup Requests Disk 9 with Multiple CD-ROM Drives

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT 3.51 Setup goes through two processes when choosing the CD-ROM
drive from which Windows NT 3.51 will be set up. First, when Setup is in text
mode, Setup prompts you to choose SCSI drives on your machine and loads Windows
NT 3.51 from the first drive specified. Second, when Setup is in the graphical
user interface (GUI) mode, Setup accesses the CD-ROM drive depending on the
priority that the CD-ROM drive has in the computer. This situation might cause
the following error message to be displayed:

   Please insert Windows NT Workstation/Server diskette # <disk number> or
   Windows NT Workstation/Server CD-ROM.

RESOLUTION
==========

To set up Windows NT 3.51 on computers with multiple CD-ROM drives installed:

 - Choose the CD-ROM drive that has first priority. You will not be able to view
   which CD-ROM drive has priority on your computer, but you can follow this
   list:

   SCSI devices
   IDE (ATAPI) devices
   Non-SCSI devices in the following order: Sony, Panasonic, Mitsumi

   -or-

 - Place the Windows NT 3.51 CD in each CD-ROM drive until the CD-ROM drive that
   has priority on your computer accepts it for copying files.
