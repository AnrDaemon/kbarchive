TITLE   :X.400 SMTP: Mixed Gateway Addresses on the To: Line
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a message is sent to both an X.400 user and an SMTP user, the Reply All
feature does not work.

CAUSE
=====

When a message is sent to an X.400 user and an SMTP user, the X.400 recipient
will not have a valid route to send mail to the SMTP recipient. The message
shows both the SMTP name and the X.400 name in the TO: header. However, the SMTP
user does not have a return address route. When the X.400 recipient chooses to
Reply All, he or she can see only the original MSMail sender, NOT the SMTP user.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is working the way it is supposed to work. There is no way for the "remote"
X.400 system to route mail to SMTP. Our mail program does not allow mail coming
in from one gateway to be routed out through another gateway. The TO: field does
include both recipients. Users will need to reconstruct their own addresses to
reach the SMTP user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Be sure you do not strip out the gateway headers when you set up your gateways.
If you strip the headers, you will not know who the original recipients were.
