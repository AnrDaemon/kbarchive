SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to select a biography for a player that doesn't have one, you
receive the following message:

   A biography for the selected player is not available.

   Complete Baseball contains biographies for major players and personalities in
   Baseball. To view these biographies, click OK. To return to the selected
   player's statistics, click Cancel.

If you click OK you return to the default Hank Aaron screen, and the Choose
Player and Show Players With default biographies selection.

Cancel returns you to the Tommie Aaron statistics screen, rather than the
selected player's statistics.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the Microsoft Complete
Baseball Guide for Windows, 1995 edition. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
