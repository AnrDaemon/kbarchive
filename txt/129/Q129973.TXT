TITLE   :MS-DOS-Based Program's Setup Causes Blue-Screen Error Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an MS-DOS-based program's Setup, you may receive the following
error message on a blue screen after you change disks:

   Error reading disk in drive <x>: Please insert disk with serial number
   <n> in drive <x> Press ENTER for OK or ESC to cancel.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 supports an "Accessed" date stamp that stores the last time a file
was opened. The error message stated above can occur when a Setup program opens
a file on a floppy disk but does not close it when you change disks.


RESOLUTION
==========

You may be able to work around this problem by using one of the following
methods:

 - Insert the program's Disk 1 and press ENTER.

 - If you write-protect the first disk before you run Setup, Windows 95 may not
   try to write the Accessed date stamp. Note, however, that some programs
   require write access to Disk 1 for Setup to run correctly.


If you continue to have problems with the application, please contact the
application's manufacturer about a possible workaround or update.
