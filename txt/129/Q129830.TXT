   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT allows you to install printer drivers from a trusted print server
share, rather than from the remote print server that your print service is
connected to.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install printer drivers from a trusted print server:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers\LanMan Print
   Services\Servers

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. From the Edit menu choose Add Value.

4. Add the following:

      Value Name:   LoadTrustedDrivers
      Data Type:    REG_DWORD
      Data:         1

5. From the Edit menu choose Add Value.

6. Add the following:

      Value Name:   TrustedDriverPath
      Data Type:    REG_SZ
      String:       \\<server name>\<share name>

Add a Unicode string representing the path from which the user can install
printer drivers. That path represents the trusted print server shares (for
example, \\<computer>\print$\w32x86). This is not a path, but a single
trusted print server that has the drivers installed, not a share with the image
of a CD-ROM.

7. Quit Registry Editor.

8. Stop and restart the Spooler service.
