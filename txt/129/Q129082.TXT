TITLE   :Cannot Access Shared or Password-Protected Resource
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msnets win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to access a shared or password-protected resource on a computer
running an international version of Windows 95 (such as German) from a computer
running the U.S. version of Windows 95, you may receive one of the following
error messages, even though you have entered the correct share name or
password:

   \\<computername>\<sharedresourcename>
   The network name cannot be found.

   The password is incorrect. Try again.

CAUSE
=====

The password or the share name on the computer running the international version
of Windows 95 may contain one or more of the following extended ASCII characters
(the decimal value of these characters is listed):

   131, 133, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 147, 149, 150, 141, 152,
   161, 162, or 163

These characters can cause problems for computers running the U.S. version of
Windows 95.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the password or share name on the computer running the international
version of Windows 95 so that it does not contain any of the extended ASCII
characters listed above.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Shared Folders
--------------

Using one or more of the extended ASCII characters listed above in the share name
of a shared folder on a computer running an international version of Windows 95
causes the folder to be inaccessible by a computer running the U.S. version of
Windows 95.

When it is connecting to a shared folder, Windows 95 converts the characters in
the share name to upper case. The characters listed above do not have uppercase
equivalents on a computer running the U.S. version of Windows 95, so the share
name does not match after Windows 95 converts the name.


Password Validation
-------------------

Using one or more of the extended ASCII characters listed above in a password
string for a shared resource on a computer running an international version of
Windows 95 causes that resource to be inaccessible by a computer running the
U.S. version of Windows 95.

Shared resource passwords are not case sensitive in Windows 95. When a password
is entered, Windows 95 converts the password to upper case and then encrypts the
password and compares it to the original password. The extended ASCII characters
listed above do not have uppercase equivalents on a computer running the U.S.
version of Windows 95, so the password does not match after it is converted to
upper case.

NOTE: If the two computers are running the same national version of Windows 95,
the passwords do match.
