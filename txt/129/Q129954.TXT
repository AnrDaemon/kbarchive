TITLE   :DOCERR: ICM_DECOMPRESSEX_QUERY dwParam1 and dwParam2 Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
 - Microsoft Video for Windows Development Kit, version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The online help (DK_DOC.HLP or DK_DOC.MVB) in the Microsoft Video for Windows DK
incorrectly documents the ICM_DECOMPRESSEX_QUERY message. The incorrect
documentation states the following:

   dwParam1 - Specifies a far pointer to an ICDECOMPRESSEX data structure
   describing the input format.

   dwParam2 - Specifies zero or a far pointer to an ICDECOMPRESSEX data
   structure used to return the output format. Zero indicates that any output
   format is acceptable.

The correct documentation for this message is listed below:

   dwParam1 - Specifies zero or a far pointer to an ICDECOMPRESSEX data
   structure used to return the output format. Zero indicates that any output
   format is acceptable.

   dwParam2 - Contains the size in bytes of the structure pointed to by
   dwParam1.

The ICSAMPLE sample code from the Microsoft Video for Windows DK correctly
handles the ICM_DECOMPRESSEX_QUERY message.

NOTE: The similarly named ICM_DECOMPRESS_QUERY message is documented correctly.
