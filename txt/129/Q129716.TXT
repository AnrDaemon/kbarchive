SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Windows 95 on a computer running the ITT XtraDrive disk
compression software you receive the following warning:

   *******************************************************************
   The following program(s) or driver(s) are running on your computer.
   Windows may not install or run correctly with these programs. It
   is recommended that you close these programs before continuing with
   Setup. To remove these programs, you may have to modify your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS files. When you are done, restart your
   computer, and then run Setup again. For more information, see
   SETUP.TXT on Setup Disk 1 or the Windows CD-ROM.

   Click OK to continue with Setup or click Cancel to Quit Setup, and
   then remove these programs.

   *******************************************************************

CAUSE
=====

This warning is somewhat misleading. The problem detected is that the ITT
XtraDrive software is configured to use write caching.

RESOLUTION
==========

Cancel Setup and reconfigure XtraDrive to disable write caching. Once you have
disabled XtraDrive's write caching, Windows 95 Setup will run correctly. For
information about how to disable write caching in XtraDrive, please refer to the
XtraDrive documentation.
