SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the Move User utility, and attempt to move a single user from one
postoffice (PO) to another PO, the following error message can occur on the
destination PO:

   A user already exists on the Postoffice Address List with the same user name.
   Change the user name assigned to this user.

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete the externally defined name in the Postoffice Address List (POL) from the
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Administration program (ADMIN.EXE); from the
Address menu, choose Delete.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On page 136 of the Microsoft Mail 3.2 "Administrator's Guide." it explains why
you may want externally defined addresses in your POL.

   "You want to add a group containing external addresses to the Global Address
   List (GAL). You do this by adding the external addresses to the POL, creating
   a group, and then rebuilding the GAL either via directory synchronization or
   with the Rebuild utility. Groups that were on the Postoffice Address List are
   automatically added to the GAL."
