TITLE   :PRB: Excel Chart Wizard Crashes When Accessed from a Form
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the user double-clicks an embedded Excel Chart object in an OLE Container
object on a form, and then uses the Excel Chart Wizard to modify that chart, the
system returns an Excel "error" dialog stating that "an error has occurred in
your program..." and giving you the options to "Close" and "Ignore."

This behavior occurs when using Windows version 3.11 or Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11, and the behavior has been observed occasionally in Windows NT
release 3.5 for workstations.

STATUS
======

This is not a bug in FoxPro. It appears to be a problem in Excel. Microsoft is
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Command window, type:

      MODIFY FORM Testchrt

2. Place an OLE Container Control on the form.

3. From "Insert Object" dialog, select Excel 5.0 chart.

4. Save the form.

5. Run the form by entering the following in the Command window:

      DO FORM Testchrt

6. Double-click the embedded Excel chart.

7. From Excel's bar of tools, select Chart Wizard. In step 1 of the Chart'
   Wizard, you select the "Range." Click anywhere in the Range text editing box.
   At this point, an error dialog box appears stating "An error has occurred in
   your application. If you choose Ignore, you should save your work in a new
   file. If you choose Close, your application will terminate."

8. Choose the "Close" option. If you're using Win32S in Windows 3.11 or Windows
   for Workgroups 3.11, the next dialog box will advise that "Excel caused a
   General Protection Fault in module EXCEL.EXE ..."
