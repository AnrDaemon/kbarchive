SUMMARY
=======

When you print in duplex mode on a Hewlett-Packard (HP) printer, the recommended
way to load a letter-head paper (for example, paper with pre- printed company
logo) in the paper tray is face down, with the letter-head away from the
printer. If you load the paper differently and the page orientation matches your
output preference, it is likely that the application has altered the print job.

For example, Microsoft Word for Windows version 6.0 includes a "reverse print
order" option which alters the way jobs print in duplex mode. Some applications
may include macros which can also alter page orientation.
