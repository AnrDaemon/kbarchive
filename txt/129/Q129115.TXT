-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Compaq Support Software Diskette (SSD) version 1.13 or later,
a Service Control Manager error may appear indicating a service or device failed
to start. The system log may contain Event ID 7022 or 7026 referencing
PRLNTSS.SYS. The error may state: The following boot-start or system-start
driver failed to load. Source PRLNTSS


CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you inadvertently install PRLNTSS.SYS when you run Compaq
SETUP.CMD. PRLNTSS.SYS allows the Compaq Fast SCSI-2 controller to run the
Compaq external disk array. You do not need it unless you are using an external
disk array.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, run Control Panel, choose Devices, and disable (stop)
Compaq Proliant Storage Subsystem.
