TITLE   :Renaming User Account Does Not Keep Permissions in LAN Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you rename a user account on a Windows NT Server primary domain controller
(PDC) and the user account has specific permissions on a Microsoft LAN Manager
Server backup domain controller (BDC), the new user account does not have the
same permissions on the LAN Manager BDC's network share.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Change the access control lists (ACLs) of all files on the LAN Manager Server
   to reference groups rather than individual users before you rename the user
   account.

2. After you rename the user account, change the ACLs of the files to include
   the new user name.

Additional query words: prodnt 2.2b 2.2c user name
