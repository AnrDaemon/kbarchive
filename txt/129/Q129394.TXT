SUMMARY
=======

There are 3 possible values for Password Solicitation with Microsoft Remote
Program Load (RPL) RemoteBoot:

   - Always

   - Optional

   - Not Solicited

This article explains the steps necessary to configure the password requirements
of a RemoteBoot workstation using the RPLCMD utility provided with RemoteBoot
for Microsoft Windows NT Server 3.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To modify the RPL database using RPLCMD, open a command window and type RPLCMD.
This list of options is displayed:

   Adapter  Boot  Config  Profile  Service  Vendor  Wksta  [Quit]

1. Type "W" for Workstation.

2. Type "S" for SetInfo.

3. Type "2" for Information level.

4. Type the name of the workstation, as defined in RPLMGR.

5. The next two prompts are optional, leave them blank to accept the current
   values.

6. At the third prompt:

   Is Remoteboot password Required, Optional or Not solicited [R, O, N]=

   type one of these password values:

   R - Required - User is prompted for password.

   O - Optional - User is given 5 seconds to enter password. If no password is
   entered, boot proceeds with a blank password.

   N - Not Solicited - Does not allow password entry.

   NOTE: Pressing ENTER at this prompt will abort the RPLCMD utility.

7. The remaining prompts are also optional.

NOTE: Microsoft strongly recommends that RPL accounts be defined via RPLMGR with
non-blank passwords to prevent unauthorized persons from booting the RPL
computer.
