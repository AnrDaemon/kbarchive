SUMMARY
=======

This article describes what property pages are and suggests diagnostics for
situations where a property page for a particular OLE control (.OCX file) might
not appear.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Property pages are the interface through which a control's properties may be
viewed and/or edited at design time. Each related set of properties appears in
its own property page. To see them, right-click the OCX at design time, and
choose Properties from the Context menu.

There are two kinds of property pages, Custom and Stock. Custom property pages
are those that need to be defined by you, the developer. Stock property pages
(like Colors, Pictures, and Fonts) are already supplied by the control
development kit (CDK).

Property pages are objects too. Each type of property page defines a new OLE
class and has a CLSID (class identifier) assigned to it. Thus, property pages
for OLE controls rely on the system registry. If a system registry entry for a
property page is missing for some reason, that property page is no longer
accessible. While this will not cause any errors, the property page will always
be invisible.

For custom property pages, this problem can be fixed by re-registering the OCX.
This can be done by choosing Custom Controls from the Tools menu, browsing to
find the control, and then selecting the appropriate .OCX file.

Standard property pages are provided by OC30.DLL for the 32-bit Visual Basic and
OC25.DLL for 16-bit Visual Basic. If the registry entries for these DLLs are
missing, then these property pages will be missing for all controls that use
them. To re-register these DLLs, reinstall Visual Basic version 4.0.
