SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Digiboard PC/Xem on an AT&T Globalyst 600 ISA computer
and initialize the Digiboard driver in Windows NT version 3.5, one or all of the
following error messages may appear:

   Digiboard FEP failed because no serial device was successfully loaded. The
   driver will unload.

   Unable to properly access NT XEM2's memory. Check for device conflicts or
   valid memory ranges.

   Digiboard adapter NT XEM2 was unable to initialize properly.

   Unable to reset NT XEM2. Wait confirmation failed.

CAUSE

The AT&T Globalyst 600 ISA computer is Plug-n-Play compliant. No memory
address for non-Plug-n-Play compliant device was reserved on the computer's
advanced BIOS setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, configure the AT&T Global 600 ISA advanced BIOS
settings. The following changes are recommended:

1. Create a 32K window.

2. Reserve a memory address for the Digiboard PC/Xem (for example, C800, (D000,
   or D800).
