-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The 3COM Etherlink 3C501 network interface card NDIS driver (ELNK.DOS) is
supported with Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) only when sharing is disabled.
However, Workgroup Connections version 1.0 does support this adapter and
includes an appropriate driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To disable sharing when you are using WFWG version 3.1, use either of the
following methods:

 - Start WFWG in standard mode by typing the following line at the MS-DOS
   command prompt:

   win /s

 - Start WFWG in 386 enhanced mode and disable sharing. To disable sharing,
   double-click the Network icon in Control Panel and then clear the Enable
   Sharing check box.

   You can also disable sharing by adding the following line to the [network]
   section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

   NoSharingControl=1

   Setting this value to 1 causes the Enable Sharing section of the Microsoft
   Windows Network dialog box to be unavailable. Setting this value to 0 causes
   the Enable Sharing section to be available so that you can select or clear
   the Enable Sharing check box. The default value for this entry is 0.

When you use the 3COM Etherlink 3C501 network interface card NDIS driver
(ELNK.DOS) with WFWG version 3.11, WFWG either will not start successfully with
the network loaded or will not allow you to create any network connections once
WFWG starts. However, WFWG will load correctly with a real- mode redirector
installed.

To use the 3C501 network adapter with the WFWG protected-mode redirector, add the
following line to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file

   C:\<windows>\NET START NETBEUI

where <windows> is the WFWG directory.

The 3COM 3C501 driver (ELNK.DOS) is not compatible with any NDIS 3 protocols.
Using the 3C501 network adapter in a WFWG network server in 386 enhanced mode
may cause data corruption on certain computers. We do not recommend or support
this configuration. The 3C501 network adapter is supported with Workgroup
Connections and LAN Manager.
