TITLE   :Cannot Use Icon When Setting Up Share Package
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a share package and select an icon for that package, some icons
fail to appear when the file containing the icon is chosen. A specific case can
be reproduced with MSOFFICE.EXE and MACRODE.EXE from the Microsoft Office CD:

1. Create new share package.

2. Choose the New button next to Program Items.

3. Choose Change Icon.

4. Choose the "..." button next to the File Name box.

5. Change to the directory that contains the setup and .EXE files for Microsoft
   Office.

6. Choose MSOFFICE.EXE.

No icon is displayed for this file. In Program manager, you can create a new
program item, change the icon using the same file name as above, and it will
show the icon.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server version
1.1.
