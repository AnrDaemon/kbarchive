SYMPTOMS
========

A file added to SourceSafe with no extension and a period (.) character is
handled incorrectly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Microsoft SourceSafe versions 3.04
and 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Microsoft Visual SourceSafe version
4.0. Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. From the command line, add a file to SourceSafe with no extension:

         SS ADD makefile.     << make sure you add the period.

2. Issue an SS DIR command. You will see the file listed.

3. Issue an SS GET makefile command. The error, "makefile is not an existing
   name or project" will occur.

4. Issue an SS GET makefile.* command. This will get the file.

5. From the command line, add the file with no period:

         SS ADD makefile

6. You will see the file listed twice when you use the SS DIR command.


1. You can remove the makefile that has no period, but you cannot now remove the
   one with a period (makefile.).
