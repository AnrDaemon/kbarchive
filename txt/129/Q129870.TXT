The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, you may receive a
message with an attachment; however, the attachment will not have an extension
on the name. If a file does not have an extension, you can not double-click it
to open and read it.

You can open a file without an extension into the NOTEPAD.EXE application by
pressing the ALT key and double-clicking the attachment icon.

NOTE: Notepad will be launched in the background. As a result, you will have to
switch to Notepad to see the attached document. However, if the file is not
ASCII text, it may not be readable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows applications have a feature called File Association that will launch a
specific application when you double-click an attachment. However, this feature
will not help you open a file without an extension.

For additional information, please see the File Associations topic in your
Microsoft Windows documentation.

Additional query words: 3.20 attachments extension
