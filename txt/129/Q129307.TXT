TITLE   :PRB: Project Manager Can't Be Docked at Bottom of Desktop
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot dock the Project Manager Window at the Bottom or Side of the Visual
FoxPro Desktop.

CAUSE
=====

The Project Manager Window is not dockable at the bottom or sides of the Visual
FoxPro Desktop.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A 'true' toolbar is 'dockable in all locations on the screen. The Project
Manager is not a 'true' Toolbar, so it is not 'dockable' in all locations of the
screen. The Project Manager is classified more as a Window than a Toolbar.
Because of this limitation, you can sometimes move the Project Manager window to
locations where it cannot be retrieved with the mouse.

For example, the Project Manager Window may become positioned off the bottom of
the screen to a spot where it is not visible or where it is barely visible but
not moveable with the mouse. In these situations, use the "MOVE WINDOW
<W_name> CENTER" command to put the Project Manager back in a useable
location.

The name of the Project Manager Window is as follows:

   "PROJECT MANAGER - "+<Project Name>

and a Project named "Test" would be re-centered like this:

   MOVE WINDOW "Project Manager - Test" CENTER
