TITLE   :PRB: OLE Error Messages Contain Both English & German Text
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An error, like the following, which contains text in both English and German
appears:

   OLE Fehlercode 0x80010007: The callee (server (not server application)) is
   not available and disappeared; all connections are invalid. the call may have
   executed. OK Hilfe"

CAUSE
=====

A German version of Visual FoxPro calls an OLE object that was created in the
English version of the server application. The error dialog (with the OK and
cancel) comes from FoxPro, so it is in German. The error message text comes from
the called application, so it is in English.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Assuming you have the German version of Visual FoxPro, and the English version of
Microsoft Draw, you can reproduce the behavior by following these steps:

1. In the Command window, type the following commands:

      CREATE TABLE german (object g)

   APPEND BLANK

2. From Edit menu (in German), select Insert Object (in German), and from the
   Insert Object dialog, select "MS Drawing."

   At this point, Microsoft Draw will crash giving the following English error
   message:

   

      ED   Application has caused an error ...Close Ignore

3. Choose Close. At this point, Microsoft Draw causes a general protection (GP)
   fault.

4. Click FoxPro's Window. Now you will see an error message from FoxPro that is
   mixture of German and English.
