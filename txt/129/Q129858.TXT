TITLE   :Error C00000BC When Changing Password in Trusted Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5x
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5x 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to change your user password in a trusted domain using TCP/IP,
the following error message appears:

   Unable to change the password on this account (C00000BC).
   Please consult your system administrator.

CAUSE
=====

When changing password in trusted domain using TCP/IP, the workstation searches
for <domainname><20> to find the primary domain controller (PDC).
However, no domain controller registers <domainname><20>.

If the workstation issues a session setup to this NetBIOS name, the session
request is rejected, and the error message above appears.

Because there is no application or server which registers
<domainname><20>, this problem occurs only when WINS or DNS server
resolves the NetBIOS name <domainname><20> to a valid IP-address
because of an erroneous WINS or DNS entry.

This entry can be caused by a client naming their computer the same name as the
domain name. This seems to cause an erroneous entry in the Wins database.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server version
4.0.

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - If you use WINS, delete the following entry: <domainname><20>

 - If you use DNS, delete the following entry: <domainname>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT Workstation or Server version 4.0.
