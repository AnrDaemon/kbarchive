TITLE   :Type 1 Font Converter Does Not Convert Some Fonts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This error message appears when you attempt to convert a complex Type 1 font to
a TrueType equivalent using the Fonts applet in Control Panel:

   Could not create "C:\<%systemroot%>\system\<name of .TTF file>"
   file. Error reading input file "A:\<name of .PFB file>" or "A:\<name
   of .PFM file>".

However, the input files in question are not corrupt, and the font is a valid
Type 1 font.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, install the font as a Type 1 font without
converting it to TrueType. Note that this provides a printer font without a
TrueType equivalent, so you will not have a matching screen font. Also, the font
will only be available for printing on PostScript print devices.

To install a Type 1 font without converting it to TrueType, follow these
instructions:

1. Start the Fonts component of Control Panel

2. Choose the Add button

3. Specify the Type 1 font you wish to install

4. Choose the OK button

   This may produce a copyright warning message. The warning only applies when
   you convert Type 1 fonts to TrueType. If you follow these steps you will not
   convert the font, and the warning will not apply.

5. Clear the Convert Type 1 Font to TrueType check box. Make sure the Install
   Type 1 Font Files for Use on a PostScript Printer option is selected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
