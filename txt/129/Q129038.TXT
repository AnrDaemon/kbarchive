SUMMARY
=======

FtDisk, the Windows NT fault tolerant driver, provides the mechanisms for
redundant data storage, volume management, and dynamic data recovery.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Dynamic data recovery is only available on SCSI drives. FtDisk works between the
physical disk drivers and the file system drivers, and works with all the
supported files systems (FAT, HPFS, and NTFS). Windows NT file system (NTFS) is
the only file system with built-in data recovery mechanisms.

The table below lists the data recovery options available when you have FtDisk
installed on an NTFS drive.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fault tolerant volumes include mirror sets (RAID 1) and stripe sets with parity
(RAID 5).

Note: If FtDisk finds a bad sector on a fault tolerant volume, and the physical
disk supports spare sectors, and has spare sectors available, FtDisk replaces
the sector. This is true for all tree supported file systems (FAT, HPFS, and
NTFS); the file system remains unaware of this mechanism.

Custer.
