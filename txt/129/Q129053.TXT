======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In order to run non-Microsoft 16-bit Windows Sockets (WinSock) applications on
RemoteBoot MS-DOS workstations, you must enable WinSock support. This article
lists a method of enabling WinSock support for RemoteBoot operation using the
16-bit real mode TCP/IP stack.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For WinSock support in RemoteBoot operation, do the following:

1. Ensure that the following lines are present in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file located
   in the %SystemRoot%\RPL\RPLFILES\<profile name> directory:

   UMB.COM
   LOAD TCPIP
   NMTSR.EXE
   SOCKETS.EXE

2. Ensure the following is included in the PATH statement:

   C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\TCPIP

3. Ensure that following lines are present in the DOSBB.CNF file located in the
   %SystemRoot%\RPL\BBLOCK\NETBEUI\<adapter name> directory:

   EXE BBLOCK\RPLBIND1.EXE ... TCPDRV.DOS

   NOTE: If any changes are made to the network card configuration details, make
   the appropriate changes to the PROTOCOL.INI file in the
   %SystemRoot%\RPL\BBLOCK\NETBEUI\<adapter name> directory.

4. Add the following line to the [tcpglobal] section of the TCPUTILS.INI file
   located in the %SystemRoot%\RPL\RPLFILES\MACHINES\<machine name>
   \<profile name>\WKSTA directory:

   [tcpglobal]
   hostname = <your computer name>

5. Add the following section to the TCPUTILS.INI file located at the
   %SystemRoot%\RPL\RPLFILES\MACHINES\<machine name>\<profile
   name>\WKSTA directory:

   [DNR]
   drivername=DNR$
   bindings=TCPIP_XIF
   domain=<TCP/IP domain name>
   nameserver0=<address of nameserver, separated by spaces>

   NOTE: Changes made to the TCPUTILS.INI file affects only the individual user
   profile. If the nameserver begins with a numeric digit, add quotes to the
   entry.

6. Add the following line to the [machinewritable files] section of the
   DOS622.FIT file located in the %SYSTEMROOT%\RPL\RPLFILES\RPLFIT directory:

   C:\LANMAN.DOS\TCPUTILS.INI\ MACHINES\(cname)\(profile) \WKSTA\TCPUTILS.INI

   NOTE: This line indicates that the TCPUTILS.INI file to be used is located at
   the individual user's profile directory instead of the global file.
