SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with the Automap
products listed at the top of this article, the car seems to bounce, or drift on
the map. The affect seems to be more noticeable when you are stationary.

RESOLUTION
==========

Try physically moving to a new location where you might receive a clearer GPS
signal. If that does not work, or you cannot move, try one of the following
troubleshooting methods:

 - Check the GPS application to verify the selected city is the closest city.
   This can be done by clicking on GPS from the menu and then selecting the
   Nearest City.

 - Verify the GPS time is accurately set. This can be verified by choosing GPS
   from the menu and then selecting Use GPS Time.

 - Look in the lower-right portion of the status bar to verify the correct time.
   Generally, if the time is wrong, it is be off in one hour increments only.

NOTE: More recent versions of the software, such as Automap Streets Plus, Automap
Trip Planner, Expedia Streets 98, and Expedia Trip Planner 98, no longer have
the ability to adjust your GPS hardware using a menu. Almost all handheld GPS
receivers use menus built into the GPS hardware to adjust the time and city
location. For additional information, consult the manual provided with your GPS
receiver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem is not related to the GPS application. Some potential causes of the
drifting symptoms include:

 - Inconsistent satellite signals

 - Signals not strong enough to establish a clean position fix

 - GPS is jumping between satellites to search for a better signal
