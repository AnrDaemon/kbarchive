KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Logitech Cyberman does not work correctly when you try to use it with an
MS-DOS-based program in a window. This problem usually occurs with MS-DOS-based
games.

CAUSE
=====

The Cyberman does not function correctly in a window because the Windows 95
Logitech mouse driver does not support Cyberman. The real-mode Cyberman drivers
for Windows 3.x provided by Logitech do not work correctly in a windowed session
in Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run MS-DOS-based programs that require the Logitech Cyberman's 3-D functionality
using the MS-DOS Mode option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you upgrade a system configured with the Logitech Cyberman from Windows or
Windows for Workgroups 3.x to Windows 95, the real-mode driver for the Cyberman
is moved from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to the DOSSTART.BAT file for MS-DOS Mode
compatibility. Setup also removes the old Logitech mouse driver from the
SYSTEM.INI file.

The hardware detection portion of Setup detects the Cyberman as a serial mouse
and installs the Windows 95 driver for the serial mouse. This lets you use the
Cyberman as a mouse with no 3-D capabilities in Windows 95.

Cyberman is manufactured by Logitech, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make
no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
