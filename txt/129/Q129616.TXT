KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience any of the following problems when you are using a Canon
BJ-200ex, BJC-600e, or BJC-4000 printer:

 - When you click the Printer button in a Windows-based application's Print
   dialog box, you receive the following error message:

   Cannot find CANON.DRV

 - After you choose the Specific Printer button in the Print dialog box, the
   Orientation, Paper Size, Paper Resource, and Options buttons are unavailable.

 - A Windows-based application causes a general protection (GP) fault when it
   cannot find the printer driver file.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program provided with the Canon printers listed above puts an
incorrect entry in the [devices] section of the WIN.INI file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Printers icon.

2. Close the Printers dialog box.

Performing this action once corrects the problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Opening and closing the Printers dialog box from Control Panel causes Windows to
correctly rewrite the [devices] section of the WIN.INI file by sorting the
[PrinterPorts] section of the file.

The Setup program that is included with the printers listed in this article add
an incorrect line to the [devices] section of the WIN.INI file. For example,
Setup might add the following line:

   Canon BJC-600e=Canon BJC-600e,LPT1

In this case, the correct line is:

   Canon BJC-600e=bjc600e,LPT1

This problem does not occur if you install the printer through Control Panel.
Canon is aware of this problem and has updated the Setup program to correct this
error.
