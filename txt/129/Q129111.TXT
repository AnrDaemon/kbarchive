TITLE   :PCI Adapter Incorrectly Identified on Dual-bus Computers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some adapters on the second bus of a dual-bus PCI computer are not correctly
detected, causing the driver to fail to load.

CAUSE
=====

On systems with dual PCI buses, Windows NT 3.5 incorrectly reports that all
adapters on the second PCI bus (bus 1) are memory-mapped. An I/O-mapped adapter
that is installed on the second bus will be incorrectly identified as
memory-mapped. I/O-mapped adapters are correctly identified when installed on
PCI bus 0.


STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
