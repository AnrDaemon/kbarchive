To replace your SCHEDMSG.DLL file
---------------------------------

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER:

   " copy schedmsg.dll <destination> " (without the quotation marks)

   where <destination> is the drive and directory where your SCHEDMSG.DLL
   file currently resides. For example, if SCHEDMSG.DLL is located in the
   MAILEXE directory on drive C and you ran the self-extracting file from the
   TEST directory on drive D, type the following command:

   " copy d:\test\schedmsg.dll c:\mailexe " (without the quotation marks)

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   " copy <mailexe>\setup.inf <mailexe>\setupinf.old " (without the
   quotation marks)

   where <mailexe> is the complete path to the directory containing the
   Microsoft Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE program. For example, if SETUP.EXE is
   located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following command:

   " copy c:\mailexe\setup.inf c:\mailexe\setupinf.old " (without the quotation
   marks)

3. Using any text editor, edit the SETUP.INF file. In the [MSMAIL] section,
   replace the following line

   1, schedmsg.dll,,,, 1993-03-09, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY,,,,,SHARED,
   75936,,,, 3.2.0.4027,

   with:

   1, schedmsg.dll,,,, 1995-04-12, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY,,,,,SHARED,
   75952,,,, 3.2.0.4086,

   Save the file and close the text editor.

   NOTE: For these changes to affect the entire network, each existing user must
   run Setup again.
