PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbVBp400

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

 - Microsoft Excel 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Excel does not display the name specified in the HostName property of
the OLE control in its worksheet when an embedded worksheet object is opened.
This behavior is exhibited by both the 16-bit and 32-bit versions of Microsoft
Excel version 5.0.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is from the Remarks section of the HostName topic in the Visual
Basic help file:

   "When editing an object, the HostName property setting may be displayed in
   the object's window title. However, some applications that provide objects
   don't display HostName."

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add an OLE Client control to Form1. When the Insert Object dialog box
   appears, select Microsoft Excel 5.0 WorkSheet.

3. Select the HostName property of the OLE control and set it to "My Server."

4. Press the F5 key to Run the program.

5. Right-click the OLE Client control, and choose Open.

The worksheet in Microsoft Excel displays "Book1" rather than "My Server."
