KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbConfig smsconfig

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Systems Management Server client software on a computer running
Windows 3.1, and VSafe was started from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, WIN.INI LOAD=
entry, WIN.INI RUN= entry, or from the Startup group, several error messages
appear referring to the Systems Manager Server client software files. The
following is one of the error messages that appears on a Windows 3.1 computer:

   SMS caused a fatal exception error at <mem address> in VXD VMM

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the entry of VSafe to "VSAFE /8-" (without
the quotation marks), or:

1. Clean boot to MS-DOS and run VSafe (Detect and Clean).

2. Run SMSLS and exit Windows. You may receive an error message from VSafe.
   Choose the Update option and reboot the computer.

3. When the following error message appears, run VSafe (Detect and Clean) again:

   Access to the specified device, path or file is denied.

4. If you receive errors during verification of files, choose Update on all
   files and reboot the computer.

5. Install the Systems Management Server client software again.
