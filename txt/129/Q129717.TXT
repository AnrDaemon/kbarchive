SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to rename a folder on a Novell NetWare network server you receive
the following error message:

   Cannot rename Folder: Cannot find the specified file.
   Make sure you specify the correct path and filename.

CAUSE
=====

The computer from which you are trying to rename the folder is configured to use
the real-mode NETX network redirector and is connected to the server using a
universal naming convention (UNC) connection. The NETX redirector does not
support renaming directories (folders) on UNC connections.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reconfigure the computer to use either the Novell NetWare VLM redirector or the
Windows 95 client for NetWare networks.
