TITLE   :Automated Setup Does Not Install BDC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Computer Profile Setup (CPS) and Unattended Setup fail to install a backup
domain controller (BDC). Setup configures the machine as a primary domain
controller (PDC) rather than as a BDC.

CAUSE
=====

NTLANMAN.INF performs an incomplete comparison of the variable STF_AUTOPRIMARY.

     ifstr(i) $(!STF_AUTOPRIMARY) != ""
         set NCPA_CMD_LINE = $(NCPA_CMD_LINE)" /t STF_AUTOPRIMARY = YES"
         endif

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, edit your answer file before using it to install
Windows NT Server. Change the line that reads:

   !AutoPrimary =    "no"

to

   !AutoPrimary =     ""

If you are running CPS, make the above modification to
%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\DEFAULTS.INF on the Distribution share after running
UPLODPRF.EXE, but before running WINNTP.EXE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and 3.51.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
