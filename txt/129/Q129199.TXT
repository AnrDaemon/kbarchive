SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running Lotus Approach under Windows NT, and Approach is accessing a
database file on your computer, the following error message appears on a Windows
for Workgroups 3.11 client when it attempts to access the database file over the
network:

   Cannot open the database "<DBF filename>.APR" because it is open
   exclusively.

CAUSE
=====

The proper file sharing options are not specified for dBASE files that are being
used in Lotus Approach.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem on the Windows NT computer:

1. Run Lotus Approach and select Open from the File menu.

2. For List File Of Type:, select either dBASE III+ (*.DBF) or dBASE IV (*.DBF)
   to list the *.DBF files that will be accessed by multiple users.

3. Choose the Connect button.

4. Select all three check boxes, including Local Databases Are Shared.

5. Choose OK.

Chapter 18 of the Lotus Approach Release 3.0 User's Guide discusses the file
sharing options available in Lotus Approach.
