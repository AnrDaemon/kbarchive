TITLE   :FIX: Custom Form Property Set to () Causes Infinite Loop
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a form is run with a DO FORM command, it appear to enter an infinite loop,
and you cannot release it. When the same form is modified with a MODIFY FORM
command, a Syntax Error is displayed. It is not possible to open the form.

CAUSE
=====

The value of a custom property has been incorrectly set to (); that is, the
value starts and ends with a parenthesis.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can manually open the form (SCX table) by using a USE command. Browse the
SCX table, and edit the Properties memo field to remove the property that is
causing the error. Then close the SCX table, and compile the form by using the
COMPILE FORM <name> command. Once the cause of the error has been removed,
you can edit the form with a MODIFY FORM command.

NOTE: manually editing the SCX table should be performed as a last resort. Use
extreme caution when deleting data from the SCX table.

If you must set a default value of () for the property, place quotation marks
around the the expression in the property sheet.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

When you attempt to modify the form in Visual FoxPro 5.0, the "Syntax Error"
message appears. However, the form opens.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a form.

2. Add a new property.

3. Change the property value to ().

4. Save and close the form.

5. Type "MODIFY FORM <form>" (without the quotation marks) to edit the
   form.
