SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Jet version 1.1 database engine behaves differently from the
version 2.0 and 3.0 database engines when it comes to processing the 'Data Has
Changed' error message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Jet version 1.1 database engine shipped with Visual Basic version
3.0. The Microsoft Jet version 2.0 database engine shipped with Microsoft Access
version 2.0, and the The Microsoft Jet version 3.0 database engine shipped with
Visual Basic version 4.0.

In Jet 1.1, the error is triggered, by default, to warn the user whenever data is
changed in the table. However, in Jet 2.0 and 3.0 this error is not
automatically triggered when data changes. To cause the Jet 2.0 and 3.0 database
engines to trigger the error message, you need to set the Options property for
the recordset to dbSeeChanges (512).

Examples Using Visual Basic Version 4.0 Syntax
----------------------------------------------

To change the Options property on a data control to the proper value, use one of
the following two methods:

 - In the design environment, make sure that the data control is the selected
   item on your form. Then go to the properties sheet, and set the Options
   property to 512.

-or-

 - In the runtime environment, use the following line of code to set the Options
   property of a data control named data1:

       data1.options = dbSeeChanges

To create a recordset with the Options property set to dbSeeChanges, you can use
this code segment:

      Dim db As Database
      Dim rs As Recordset

      Set db = DBEngine.WorkSpaces(0).OpenDatabase("biblio.mdb")
      Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("authors", dbOpenDynaset, dbSeeChanges)

Steps to Trigger Error
----------------------

After the Options property of the recordset is set, you can trigger the error by
performing the following sequence of events:

1. Ensure that two programs have the same record open in an edit mode.

2. Have both programs make changes to that record.

3. Have one program save its changes.

4. Have the second program attempt to save its changes. At this point, the error
   message is triggered.
