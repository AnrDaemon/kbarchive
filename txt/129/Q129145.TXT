TITLE   :Commas Not Recognized in NetWare Logon Scripts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Windows 95 client for NetWare networks with logon script
processing enabled, you receive the following error message if your logon script
contains IF statements that use commas as separators:

   Login Script Error: Error interpreting command line.

CAUSE
=====

The logon script processor that is installed with the Windows 95 client for
NetWare networks (NWLSPROC.EXE) does not support the use of commas as separators
with the IF statement.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, replace the commas used as separators in IF statements
with the AND keyword. The comma is normally used in IF statements as a
replacement for the AND keyword, so you will lose no functionality when you use
this workaround.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
