TITLE   :Modem Defaults to Auto Answer Mode in Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your modem is set to Auto Answer mode under Microsoft Exchange in Windows 95,
even though the current Exchange profile calls for Auto Answer mode to be
disabled.

CAUSE
=====

The modem's answer mode is a modem property, not a profile property. Therefore,
the answer mode is set by the last profile created in Microsoft Exchange.

For example:

 - Profile 1 is created and sets the modem to Auto Answer mode.

 - Profile 2 is created and sets the modem to No Answer mode.

In this example, the modem is set to No Answer mode regardless of the current
Exchange profile setting.

RESOLUTION
==========

Changing profiles does not change the state of the modem's properties. To change
the properties, you must either create a new profile or set the properties
directly.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior also explains why a modem appears to default to Auto Answer mode
when you set up a profile. If the modem was configured to use Auto Answer mode
in a previous profile, the modem defaults to this mode.

If the modem was configured to use No Answer mode in a previous profile, it
defaults to No Answer mode.
