If you disable SCSI support in your AMD CMOS settings and then install
Windows NT (by running WINNT /B or WINNT32 /B, or Express Setup), Windows
NT Setup detects the SCSI adapter and installs the AMD SCSI driver.

The driver loads correctly but you cannot access SCSI devices normally. The
system log indicates that the driver failed to load.

To correct this problem, either enable SCSI support in your CMOS settings
or run Windows NT Setup and remove the SCSI adapter driver.
