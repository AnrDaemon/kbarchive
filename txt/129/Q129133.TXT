TITLE   :XCLN: Can't Switch from Message Back to Address Book
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you compose a new message, you cannot select a name from the address book,
choose the Compose New Message button, and then move back to the address book to
select more names.

CAUSE
=====

This operation is by design. The dialog box is modal in nature; therefore, it
requires completion of the action--in this case, selection of the Send
button--before any other operation can be taken.
