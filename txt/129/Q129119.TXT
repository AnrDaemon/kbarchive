TITLE   :Unable to Set Typematic Rate on AT&T Globalyst
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under Windows NT 3.5, you are unable to set the typematic rate on a 90 mHz
AT&T Globalyst 600 (3356) Pentium ISA/PCI. Changing these settings in the
CMOS or in Control Panel has no effect.

NOTE: The AT&T Globalyst 600 (3356) Pentium ISA/PCI in on the December 1994
Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). The NCR H0150-STD1-12-17 and 3299-K440- V003
are the standard keyboards for this computer.

CAUSE
=====

The problem appears to be related to the speed of the machine. Slower machines
with the same keyboard work fine, but the 90mhz machines fail consistently.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The initialization code for i8042prt sends a control byte to the keyboard
controller to set the typematic rate and the keyboard indicator lights. It then
waits a preset, but arbitrary, amount of time for a return. If no return is
received, a message is posted to event viewer and initialization proceeds. The
waiting period is not configurable through the user interface or the registry.

The Events posted include:

   Event ID 19: I8042_SET_TYPEMATIC_FAILED
   Message Text: Could not set the keyboard typematic rate and delay.
   Status: 0xC0050013

   Event ID 20: I8042_SET_LED_FAILED
   Message Text: Could not set the keyboard indicator lights.
   Status: 0xC0050014

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
