When you put a TAB in a new line after a word wraps around from the
previous line in Cardfile and save the file, the TAB is removed.

To work around this problem, press Enter to place a carriage return at
the end of the line above the TAB.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.1 and
3.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: prodnt 3.10 crd space card file
