SYMPTOMS
========

SourceSafe fails to create an output file when executing the Checkout Command.
This occurs when the file specified to be checked out is not a valid file in the
current project or the specified path does not exist.

The following won't create an output file if the filename doesn't exist in the
current project:

   SS CHECKOUT test -o&@filename.txt

The ampersand (&) and at (@) characters make no difference.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Microsoft Visual SourceSafe version
3.1 for Windows, Windows NT, MS-DOS, and Macintosh.
This bug was corrected in Microsoft Visual SourceSafe version 4.0.
