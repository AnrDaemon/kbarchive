TITLE   :Macintosh Clients Generate Event ID 180 and MIF Files

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

At a Systems Management Server Site which contains Macintosh clients, Event ID
180 may be frequently written to the system log and several .MIF files may be
created, along with corresponding events in the Windows NT and Systems
Management Server Event Viewers. The Windows NT Event Viewer application Log and
SMS Event Viewer messages have the following syntax:

      Information from module: SMS_INVENTORY_DATA_LOADER.

   Operation:   Validation
   Object:      MIF
   Object name: SMS

A new machine is being entered into the database. Some of the identification
attributes for the machine being added overlap with another machine in the
database.

   Current Machine:
   <SMSID = LAM00002, SMSLocation = LAM|LAMWORLD|, NetCardID =
   08:00:07:B4:AD:65>

   Overlapping Machine:
   <SMSID = LAM0000L, SMSLocation = LAM|LAMWORLD|, NetCardID =
   08:00:07:B4:AD:90>

   MachineName = LAMJAM
   SiteCode = LAM
   Component = SMS_INVENTORY_DATA_LOADER

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Systems Management Server checks the inventory .MIF files from each
Macintosh client for a unique SMSLocation attribute (no other client in the
Systems Management Server Database has the same SMSLocation). The SMSLocation
attribute is a concatenation of the client's Systems Management Server Site
code, Domain, and Name attributes. If Systems Management Server determines that
an inventory .MIF file contains an SMSLocation attribute that is not unique,
Systems Management Server generates a Windows NT Event and a Systems Management
Server Event .MIF file for each machine in the Systems Management Server
database that has the same SMSLocation.

When the Systems Management Server Macintosh Inventory Agent determines that a
Macintosh client does not have a Macintosh Name defined in the Macintosh Sharing
Setup, the inventory leaves the Systems Management Server Name attribute blank.
Therefore, when multiple Macintosh machines reside in the same site/domain
combination have no Macintosh names, their SMSLocation is not unique. This
generates Event Viewer messages and Event MIF files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To workaround this problem, define a unique Macintosh name for each Macintosh
client. The Macintosh computer name is created by running the Sharing Setup
application in the Macintosh System Folder's Control Panel.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server version
1.1.
