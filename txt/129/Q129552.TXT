SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet that contains rotated text to a Compaq
PageMarq 20 printer, the text is rotated at an incorrect angle if the graphics
resolution is set to 800 x 400.

CAUSE
=====

Lotus 1-2-3 is unable to print rotated text accurately to a Compaq Page- Marq 20
printer using an asymmetrical graphics resolution. This behavior is specific to
Lotus 1-2-3 and is not caused by a problem in Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, change the graphics resolution to a symmetrical
resolution such as 300 x 300.
