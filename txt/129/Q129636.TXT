TITLE   :PRB: "Ambiguous name detected" Compile-Time Error in VB 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Better type checking in Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 causes it to return a
compile-time error message when you declare two functions (or subroutines) with
the same name in the same module or form. This is a change in behavior from
Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0.

The error message returned is:

   Ambiguous name detected: <function or sub name>

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add the following code to the general declarations section of Form1:

      Private Declare Function GetSystemDirectory Lib "Kernel" _
         (ByVal strBuffer As String, ByVal intSize As Integer) As Integer
      Private Declare Function GetSystemDirectory% Lib "Kernel" _
         (ByVal lpBuffer$, ByVal nSize%)

3. Attempt to run the application by pressing the F5 key. Visual Basic will not
   run the application. Instead you will get this error message:

   Ambiguous name detected: GetSystemDirectory
