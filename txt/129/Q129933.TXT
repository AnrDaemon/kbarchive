TITLE   :PRB: Comparing Bookmarks Generates Type Mismatch Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to use the Bookmark property in a compare operation with another
bookmark, you receive the following error if the bookmarks are not first stored
in string variables:

   Run-time error 13 - Type Mismatch

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. Bookmarks in Visual Basic version 4.0 are stored in byte
arrays. Arrays cannot be directly compared to each other.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before accessing the Bookmark property, copy the bookmark values to string
variables, and make all comparisons using the string variables. The following
code compares two bookmarks correctly.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. In the click event for Form1, place the following code:

      Private Sub Form_Click()
         Dim Db As Database
         Dim Rs As Recordset
         Dim Cs As Recordset
         Dim sBook1 as String
         Dim sBook2 as String

         Set Db = DBEngine.Workspaces(0).OpenDatabase("biblio.mdb")
         Set Rs = Db.OpenRecordset("authors", dbOpenDynaset)
         Set Cs = Rs.Clone()

         sBook1 = Rs.Bookmark
         sBook2 = Cs.Bookmark

         If sBook1 = sBook2 Then
            MsgBox "Match"
         Else
            MsgBox "No Match"
         End If
      End Sub

3. Run the program by pressing the F5 key.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Use the above example, but replace the code in the Form_Click procedure with this
code:

      Private Sub Form_Click()
         Dim Db As Database
         Dim Rs As Recordset
         Dim Cs As Recordset

         Set Db = DBEngine.Workspaces(0).OpenDatabase("biblio.mdb")
         Set Rs = Db.OpenRecordset("authors", dbOpenDynaset)
         Set Cs = Rs.Clone()

         If Rs.Bookmark = Cs.Bookmark Then  'Error 13 - Type Mismatch
            MsgBox "Match"
         else
            MsgBox "No Match"
         End If
      End Sub
