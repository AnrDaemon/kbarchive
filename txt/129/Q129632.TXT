(1) The actual file size (in bytes) cannot exceed two gigabytes for
single-user or exclusively opened multiuser .DBF files. Shared multiuser
.DBF files with no indexes or .IDX indexes cannot exceed one gigabyte. All
Visual FoxPro tables and shared multiuser 2.x .DBF files with structural
.CDX indexes cannot exceed two gigabytes.

(2) Limited by memory and available file handles. .CDX files use only one
file handle.

(3) A program module is one procedure. A program or application can contain
