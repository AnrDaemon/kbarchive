======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are unable to move or resize an MS-DOS-based application's window using the
mouse.

CAUSE
=====

Mouse operations are exclusive to the application running in the window.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to control the window features of an MS-DOS-based application, do
not enable the Exclusive Mode option for the application's mouse settings.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you enable the mouse's Exclusive Mode option for an MS-DOS-based
application, you can interact with the application's window only by using the
keyboard, and the window controls (such as the toolbar and the Minimize,
Maximize, and Restore buttons) are not available. Also, the window's sizing
controls are not operational when you enable the Exclusive Mode option.

To enable the Exclusive Mode option for an MS-DOS-based application, follow these
steps:

1. With the MS-DOS-based application running in a window, use the right mouse
   button to click the window's title bar and then click Properties on the menu
   that appears.

2. Click the Misc tab.

3. In the Mouse section, click the Exclusive Mode check box.

4. Click OK.

To disable the Exclusive Mode option for an MS-DOS-based application running in a
window, follow these steps:

1. Press ALT+ENTER to switch the application to run in a full screen.

2. Press ALT+TAB until the application is minimized.

3. Use the right mouse button to click the application's button on the taskbar
   and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

4. Click the Misc tab.

5. In the Mouse section, click the Exclusive Mode check box to clear it.

6. Click OK.
