SYMPTOMS
========

When you change routing information for an external postoffice with Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks Administration program (ADMIN.EXE) version 3.2.13 and
earlier, ADMIN.EXE does not report a failure to update the .XTN file if the .XTN
file is locked open by another process, such as EXTERNAL.EXE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions earlier than 3.2.13 of
ADMIN.EXE. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
