SUMMARY
=======

When you use Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer to create a form, you can set the
properties of a field to be Required, Locked, or Hidden. Take caution not to set
a field to be Required and then also set it to be Locked or Hidden. This could
result in problems when the form is run. (The user is required to enter data in
a field but cannot because the field is locked or hidden.) Only one of these
combinations should be used when you plan to add code to the form using
Microsoft Visual Basic to properly fill in the Required field.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you design a form, you can write Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 code
that correctly fills in a field set as Required. For example, this could include
a calculation of other fields or data retrieved from another source. Therefore,
the field could be locked or hidden, which would limit the user's ability to
modify the calculated field.

The Required, Locked, and Hidden properties are set within the Field Properties
dialog box in Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer.
