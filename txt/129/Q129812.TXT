TITLE   :PCMCIA Cards Not Detected on Zenith NoteFLEX
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Zenith NoteFLEX 486DX computer with a PCIC-compatible
controller (with a Cirrus Logic chip set), PCMCIA cards are not enumerated when
you insert them. PCMCIA cards are enumerated only if they are already inserted
when you start your computer.

CAUSE
=====

There is a known problem with the automatic detection of available IRQs on the
Zenith NoteFLEX computer. As a result, Windows 95 assigns a default set of IRQs
for its mask. Although IRQ 10 is in the default mask assigned by Windows 95, IRQ
10 is not supported on NoteFLEX computers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use Registry Editor (REGEDIT) to add the following
registry entry. This entry overrides the default mask:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\PCMCIA\0000

Add a key called PCICOptions to the entry, and assign the following value for the
key:

   b8 0a 00 00

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.
