TITLE   :FIX: Installing CDK Appears to Corrupt Visual C++ Help Index
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbole kbCtrlkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE Control Developer's Kit (CDK) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing the 32-bit CDK, you may find that some keyword searches in the
Help menu bring up references to a non-existent help file ("Miscellaneous Tools
Quick Reference" - TOOLS20.HLP) or don't find anything at all (OLE API
functions).

CAUSE
=====

The 32-bit CDK installation copies its own help files into the \MSVC20\HELP
directory. It replaces the default Visual C++ version 2.0 index file
(MSVC20.IDX) with its own copy. The MSVC20.IDX that comes with the CDK does not
include all the correct indexes to the correct help files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reinstalling the help files for Visual C++ version 2.0 will restore the original
MSVC20.IDX index file. To access the CDK help files, you will need to open them
separately, using WINHLP32.EXE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Microsoft OLE Control
Developer's Kit (CDK), version 1.1.
