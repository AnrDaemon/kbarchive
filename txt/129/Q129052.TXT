SYMPTOMS
========

After you install IntelliType software, the Pointer Control and Pointer Activity
tabs may be missing from IntelliType Manager. Also, the Sounds, Key Locks, and
Enable/Disable Caps Lock Key options are unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when the Microsoft IntelliType software is installed
without a Microsoft Natural Keyboard attached to the computer. IntelliType is
designed to work with a 8042 keyboard controller chip exclusively.

To correct this problem, ensure that your computer has an 8042 keyboard
controller chip.
