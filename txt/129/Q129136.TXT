TITLE   :XCLN: Pointer Doesn't Change When New Mail Is Received
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You configure your client to notify you of new mail using the Briefly Change The
Pointer notification option in the Options dialog box. However, when you receive
new mail on a Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 and Windows NT clients, the pointer
does not change as expected.

CAUSE
=====

When you receive new mail, the pointer will only change when it is inside the
Microsoft Exchange client window. If the pointer is in another application or
outside the Microsoft Exchange window, it will not change when new mail arrives.
This is due to a limitation of cursor control on the 32-bit Windows platforms.

RESOLUTION
==========

With 32-bit Windows platforms, you can take advantage of other notification
options, such as playing a sound or displaying a notification message. In
addition, Windows 95 will automatically display a new mail notification icon on
its taskbar.
