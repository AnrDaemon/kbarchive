======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51

When you attempt to upgrade an NCR 3455 computer with one or more 53C700
cards running UNIX LAN Manager Server to Windows NT, Setup reports that the
53C700 card is not installed in the computer. The installation cannot
continue. Both the NCR 3455 and the 53C700 are on the Windows NT Hardware
Compatibility List (HCL).

There is no way to work around this problem other than by replacing the NCR
53C700 with an NCR 53C710 card or Buslogic MicroChannel adapter.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
