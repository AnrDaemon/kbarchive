Additonal troubleshooting steps for Windows 3.x:

1. Open Control Panel (usually located in the Main group).

2. Double-click 386 Enhanced.

3. Click Virtual Memory.

4. Verify that there is a swapfile of at least 6,000 KB. If there is no swapfile
   or a swapfile less than 6,000 KB, a larger swapfile will need to be created.

   NOTE: For better performance, a permanent swapfile should be created.

For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
printed documentation or online Help.
