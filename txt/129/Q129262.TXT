PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Digicom Systems (DSI) Scout Plus fax/modem, fax
transmissions fail.

CAUSE
=====

DSI Scout Plus fax/modems fail to negotiate with some brands of fax/modems and
fax machines because of the manner in which flow control is implemented on this
fax/modem.

For example, it has been reported that the DSI Scout Plus fax/modem cannot
negotiate with the following equipment:

 - Compaq 2411

 - Compaq 224ATF

RESOLUTION
==========

To use the DSI Scout Plus fax/modem successfully with Windows 95, you must
change the flow control method. To do so, change the SetupCommand key to
"ATS7=255&D3*F2" (without quotations marks) in the following registry
entry:

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\At Work Fax\Local Modems\TAPIxxxxx

After you make this change, restart Microsoft Exchange.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.
