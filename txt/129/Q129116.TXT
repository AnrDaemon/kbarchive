TITLE   :Members of the Server Operators Group Cannot Add Workstations
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to add workstations to a domain from Server Manager while logged into
the domain as a member of the Server Operators group (but not a member of the
Administrators group), the following error message appears:

   Access is Denied

CAUSE
=====

Footnote 1 on page 64 of the Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 "Concepts
and Planning Guide" incorrectly states the following:

   Member[s] of the domain's Administrators and Server Operators
   group can always add workstations to a domain, whether or not
   they have this right assigned to them. This right is needed only
   to enable users who are not members of these groups to add
   workstations to the domain.

The footnote should say:

   Members of the domain's Administrators and Account Operators
   groups can always add workstations to a domain, whether or not
   they have this right assigned to them. This right is needed only
   to enable users who are not members of these groups to add
   workstations to the domain.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem,

 - Logon as an Account Operator

   -or-

 - Open User Manager for Domains, select User Rights from the Policies menu,
   choose the "Add Workstations to the Domain" right and add the Server
   Operators group.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
