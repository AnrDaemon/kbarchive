SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a map or table from Automap Road Atlas, odd behavior such as
random characters appearing on the page and ejection of blank pages may occur
with IBM Proprinters, especially the X24 and XL24 models.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve erratic printing try step one below. If that doesn't work, or if you
are using a newer software-configured printer, try step two.

1. Turn on DIP switch #7.

   -or-

2. Switch printer to Alternate Graphics Mode.

When you print graphics to older model IBM Proprinters, changing the DIP switch
setting may resolve the problem. On newer IBM Proprinters the configuration is
controlled by software.

Switching to Alternate Graphics mode allows Automap Road Atlas to overlay the
vector information, while bitmap information is printed. Vector information sent
from the program is the cause of the odd behavior.
