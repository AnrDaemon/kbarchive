SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Fax Cover Page Editor has an Undo feature that lets you undo up to
five tasks. However, you can undo only one task in a text box.

For example, if you type "This is a test" (without the quotation marks) in a text
box, delete the word "this," delete the word "test," then click Undo, you can
undo only the last deletion. If you click Undo multiple times, the word "test"
appears and disappears.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Fax Cover Page Editor uses the standard edit controls for text boxes. The
standard edit controls support only one level of Undo. Other aspects of the Fax
Cover Page Editor (such as graphic boxes) are not affected by this behavior.
