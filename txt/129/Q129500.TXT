The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how the Microsoft Mail Group Import Program, GIMPORT.EXE
version 3.5 and later, can be used to automate the process of removing all
Microsoft Mail Postoffice Address List Groups and resetting the group files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

GIMPORT.EXE version 3.5 and later has a command line option, -r, which when used
will remove all Postoffice Address List Groups and reset all relevant group
files to their default states. Before you run GIMPORT.EXE, it is advisable to
read the Application Note that accompanies the GIMPORT.EXE. Also, it is
recommended that you backup the following directories of your Microsoft Mail
postoffice: GLB, GRP, NME, and MEM.

The following command shows how to run GIMPORT.EXE to remove all the Postoffice
Address List Groups and reset the group files:

   GIMPORT -dm admin -p<password> -r -v -lgimport.log

where,

 - the Microsoft Mail postoffice is located on drive M.

 - admin is a Microsoft Mail account with Administrative privilege.

 - <password> refers to the password for the 'admin' account.

When the above command is run, GIMPORT.EXE will reset the following files:

 - ADMIN.GRP and ADMINSHD.GRP to 8 bytes, which are set to zeroes.

 - GROUP.GLB to 4 bytes, which are set to zeroes.

 - GRPMEM.GLB to 4 bytes, which are set to zeroes.

In addition, the groups are removed from the ADMIN.NME and ADMINSHD.NME. All
non-deleted records in the ACCESS.GLB file are modified to reset the pointer
into the GRPMEM.GLB. All the .MEM files are removed from the MEM directory.
