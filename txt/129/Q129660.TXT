KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click New or Open on the Microsoft Fax properties Message tab, nothing
happens.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur because the Fax Cover Page Editor is already open. When
you click New or Open, you open the Fax Cover Page Editor. If you click New or
Open again before you close the Fax Cover Page Editor, nothing happens.

The Fax Cover Page Editor is designed to run only one instance of itself at a
time.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods:

 - Close the Fax Cover Page Editor before you click New or Open again.

 - To start another instance of the Fax Cover Page Editor, start the next
   instance from the Start menu. To do so, click the Start button, point to
   Programs, point to Accessories, point to Fax, and then click Cover Page
   Editor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view or change Microsoft Fax properties, follow these steps:

1. Double-click the Microsoft Fax Status icon on the taskbar.

   NOTE: If this icon is not present, first double-click the Inbox icon on the
   desktop, then click the Fax profile if prompted.

2. On the Tools menu, point to Microsoft Fax Tools, then click Options.

3. Click the Message tab.

The Default Cover Page section lets you select, create, or preview a cover page.
