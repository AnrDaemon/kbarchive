======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1993 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play an audio clip, and your window contains a scroll bar to allow
viewing of the complete article, the audio ceases if you scroll far enough right
to move the audio controller out of the window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows,
1993 edition. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows,
1994 and 1995 editions.

WORKAROUND
==========

The problem can sometimes be resolved if you change the size of the your viewing
window. Resizing the window brings the entire article into view, making the
scroll bar unnecessary. This method only works if the current window is not full
screen.
