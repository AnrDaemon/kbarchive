SYMPTOMS
========

Although the Canon LBP-8 IV printer supports printing 600 dpi, this option does
not appear in the printer's properties in Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

According to Canon, the LBP-8 IV printer does not successfully print 600 dpi in
International Standards Organization (ISO) mode. Therefore, the Windows 95
printer driver for this printer supports only 75, 150, or 300 dpi. 300 dpi is
the default value.


RESOLUTION
==========

For more information about this problem, please contact Canon.
