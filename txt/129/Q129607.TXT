SYMPTOMS
========

The icon in the Printers folder for a printer that is connected to a redirected
parallel port may not indicate that the printer is a network printer. That is,
although the printer is a network printer, it may appear as a local printer in
the Printers folder.

CAUSE
=====

The port that the printer is connected to was only recently redirected. The
appropriate Windows subsystem has not yet been notified of the change.


RESOLUTION
==========

Refresh the port status by following these steps:

1. Double-click My Computer.

2. Double-click the Printers folder.

3. Use the right mouse button to click the printer, then click Properties on the
   menu that appears.

4. Click the Details tab, then click the OK button.

NOTE: If you have multiple printers with this problem, following the above steps
should correct the problem for all of them.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
