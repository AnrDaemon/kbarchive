Windows NT Backup restores files only to the destination that was
originally backed up. If you have files that you want to restore to a
different directory, you have to restore the directory tree along with the
files. For example, if the files on tape are in the \USERS\TOM
subdirectory, and you want to restore the files to C:\FILES, when you
restore and choose Alternate Path (C:\FILES), Windows NT Backup restores
the files to C:\FILES\USERS\TOM.

This can be a problem if you need to restore Windows NT files, and you
reinstall Windows NT to a new directory (for example, you old Windows NT
directory was C:\WINNT, and your new Windows NT directory is C:\WINNT35).
You can work around this problem by using Backup Exec from Arcada. When you
run Backup Exec and select Alternate Path, it offers you the option to keep
the directory structure or to discard it.
