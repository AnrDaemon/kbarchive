======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install a 3Com Etherlink III (3C509B) ISA (Plug-and-Play Ready)
network interface card (NIC) on a PCI-bus computer, the following error message
appears on the PCI Auto-Configuration screen:

   Auto-Configuration Error <error number>
   Bus#: <bus number>
   Device#: <device number>
   Function#: <function number>

When you start Windows NT version 3.5 or Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, the
system stops responding (hangs).

NOTE: The system may stop responding on a computer of any bus type.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs on some systems with the following configuration:

 - Plug-and-Play option is enabled on the 3c509b NIC

 - Using a driver dated earlier than 2/7/95

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem:

1. Download EtherDisk version 4.2 (3C5X9X.EXE) from the 3Com Bulletin Board
   Service (BBS) at (408) 980-8204 to a blank formatted floppy disk.

2. Extract the file by typing the following at the command prompt:

   3C5X9X

3. To correct the PCI Auto-Configuration error, disable the Plug-and-Play
   feature on the 3C509B NIC by typing the following at the command prompt:

   PNPDSABL.BAT

4. In order for the operating system to function properly with the 3C509B NIC,
   replace the existing driver with the driver provided by 3C5X9X.EXE. For
   example, to replace the 3C509B NIC driver for Windows NT version 3.5, rename
   the existing ELNK3.SYS driver in the %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS
   subdirectory. Go to the \NDIS\WINNT35 subdirectory on the EtherDisk version
   4.2 floppy disk and type the following at the command prompt:

   COPY ELNK3.SYS <drive>:\%SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS

5. Restart your computer.
