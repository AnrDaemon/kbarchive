The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 on a Novell NetWare
network using Novell's IPX/ODI drivers, you may receive the following error
message when you try to log on to a Window NT domain or to browse network
resources:

   No Domain Server was available to validate your password. You were logged on
   without password validation.

   The list of servers for this workgroup is not currently available.

CAUSE
=====

The NetBEUI network protocol requires the Ethernet_802.2 frame type. Removing
this frame type from the NET.CFG file disables all network functionality if
NetBEUI is the only installed network protocol.

RESOLUTION
==========

To restore network functionality, add the Ethernet_802.2 frame type for the
NetBEUI protocol or the Ethernet_II frame type for the TCP/IP-32 protocol in the
NET.CFG file. The following example demonstrates a sample LINK DRIVER section of
a NET.CFG file using the EXP16ODI MLID:

      LINK DRIVER EXP16ODI
         Frame Ethernet_802.3
         Frame Ethernet_802.2
         Frame Ethernet_II
         Frame Ethernet_Snap

Make sure that the first frame type listed in this section is the frame type used
by the Novell NetWare server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run Network Setup, Setup automatically adds all four frame types to the
NET.CFG file if it detects that the IPX/ODI drivers are loaded. If the
Ethernet_802.2 frame type is missing from the NET.CFG file, either the ODI
drivers were not loaded when you started Network Setup or the frame type was
later deleted from the file.
