SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer was designed to be run from a local
installation of Windows. Although it is possible to run the Windows client off
the network, the Forms Designer must be run from a local copy of Windows. Forms
created using the Forms Designer, however, can be run correctly from a shared
network installation of Windows.
