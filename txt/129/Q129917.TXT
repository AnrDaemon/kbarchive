SUMMARY
=======

In Visual FoxPro for Windows 3.0, you can use the ADBOBJECTS() function to find
out which tables exist in a database container.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The syntax for the ADBOBJECTS() function is as follows:

      ADBOBJECTS(arrayname,csetting)

The arrayname parameter specifies the name of the array in which the names are
placed. If the array you specify doesn't exist, Visual FoxPro automatically
creates the array. If the array exists and isn't large enough to contain all the
names, Visual FoxPro automatically increases the size of the array to
accommodate the names. If the array is larger than necessary, Visual FoxPro
truncates the array. If the array exists and ADBOBJECTS( ) returns zero (0)
because no names are found, the array remains unchanged. If the array doesn't
exist and ADBOBJECTS() returns zero (0), the array isn't created.

The cSetting parameter specifies which names to place in the memory variable
array. The following table shows the allowable values for cSetting and the
corresponding names placed in the array:

   cSetting      Names
   ---------------------------
   CONNECTION    Connection names
   RELATION      Table relationships
   TABLE         Table names
   VIEW          View names

The following example code demonstrates how to determine which tables exist in a
DBC:

      OPEN DATABASE C:\VFP\SAMPLES\DATA\testdata.dbc
      =ADBOBJECTS(tablearry,"TABLE")
      DISPLAY MEMORY LIKE tablearry
