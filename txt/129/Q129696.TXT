SYMPTOMS

If you copy the contents of the Windows NT Resource Kit version 3.5 to a
directory with a space in its name and run Setup, this message appears:

   Microsoft Setup

   SETUP [/?] [/f] [/i <INF Src File>]
         [/c <Script Section>] [/s <Src Path>]
         [/t <Var> = Value>] [/v]

   /? - generates this Usage message.
   /f - turns off blue background.
   /i - defaults to Current Working Directory + 'SETUP.INF'.
   /c - defaults to 'Shell Commands'.
   /s - defaults to Current Working Directory.
   /t - set INF <var> to <value>. multiple /T valid.
   /v - turn on INF syntax checking.

If you choose OK, the installation fails.

 - Move the Windows NT Resource Kit version 3.5 files to a directory path that
   does not include a space.
