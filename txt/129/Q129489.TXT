TITLE   :DEC 101 Card Does Not Function After Server-Based Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a DEC 101 network interface card, you are unable to connect
to the network after performing a server-based installation of Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

The NDIS 2 or NDIS 3 network interface card drivers that Windows 95 is using are
not configuring the DEC 101 network interface card properly. Some settings for
the DEC 101 network interface card allow the card to function properly when ODI
drivers are used, but not when NDIS 2 or NDIS 3 drivers are used. In such cases,
if the Windows 95 NDIS drivers are using the same settings as the ODI drivers
you were using before installing Windows 95, the network interface card is not
configured properly and does not function.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that the NDIS drivers are configuring the DEC 101 network interface
card properly. For information about how to do so, please contact DEC.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DEC 101 network interface card is an 8-bit card. This problem does not occur
with similar 16-bit DEC cards.
