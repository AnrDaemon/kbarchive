The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you send an e-mail message, MSN, The Microsoft Network, checks the
address against the Address Book. You can avoid having addresses checked
by using one-off addressing, as illustrated below:

   Format                         Example
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   [MSN:<MSN member name>]        [MSN:TeddyBear]
   [MSNINET:<Internet address>]   [MSNINET:abc@example.microsoft.com]

Note that you must type the brackets as shown in the examples above.
