SYMPTOMS
========

You can use the Ping tool to ping your own computer, but you cannot access the
network using the TCP/IP protocol. You may receive the following error message
when you try to access the network:

   Request timed out

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when you are using a Novell NetWare ODI driver and the
Ethernet_II frame type is not listed in the proper NET.CFG file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, add Ethernet_II to the NET.CFG file. Make sure you edit
the correct NET.CFG file--NET.CFG is usually read from the same directory as
LSL.COM. Note that you should not make Ethernet_II the first frame type listed
in the file.

To add Ethernet_II to the NET.CFG file, follow these steps:

1. Use any text editor (such as WordPad) to open the NET.CFG file.

2. Add "ETHERNET_II" (without quotation marks) so that it is the last frame type
   listed in the "LINK DRIVER <MLID>" section. For example, after you add
   "ETHERNET_II" the section might look like:

      LINK DRIVER <MLID>
         FRAME ETHERNET_802.2
         FRAME ETHERNET_802.3
         FRAME ETHERNET_SNAP
         FRAME ETHERNET_II

3. Save and close the NET.CFG file.

4. Restart your computer.
