TITLE   :BUG: Winsock--Lost FD_WRITE Notifications
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAPI kbSDKPlatform kbOSWin310bug kbWinsock kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

In both of the following situations, the initial FD_WRITE notifications are
never received:

 - Create a datagram socket and call WSAAsyncSelect() with interest in FD_WRITE
   notification.

   -or-

 - Create a stream socket, call connect() to connect to a TCP server and call
   WSAAsyncSelect() with interest in FD_WRITE notification.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the first case, call the bind() function in addition to the socket() function
as shown:

      SOCKADDR_IN source_sin;

      source_sin.sin_family = AF_INET;
      source_sin.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);
      source_sin.sin_port = htons(0);

      s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
      bind(s, (struct sockaddr FAR *)&source_sin,sizeof(source_sin));
      WSAAsyncSelect(s, hWnd, WSA_WRITE, FD_WRITE);

The window specified by hWnd in WSAAsyncSelect() will now receive the FD_WRITE
notifications properly.

In second case, call socket() and call connect() asynchronously as shown:

      SOCKADDR_IN dest_sin;

      dest_sin.sin_family = AF_INET;
      dest_sin.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(SERV_HOST_ADDR);
      dest_sin.sin_port = htons(SERVER_TCP_PORT);

      s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
      WSAAsyncSelect(s, hWnd, WSA_WRITE, FD_CONNECT | FD_WRITE);
      connect(s, (struct sockaddr FAR *)&dest_sin, sizeof(dest_sin);

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the beginning
of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a datagram client is not expecting to receive a response from a server, it
can send data without first binding the datagram socket to a specific port.
According to this behavior, a datagram socket should be able to receive FD_WRITE
notifications after calling socket() and WSAAsyncSelect().
