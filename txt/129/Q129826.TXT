SUMMARY
=======

When you either display or print a Team Season Schedule, the calendar day of the
week goes from Sunday to Saturday.

As a general rule, professional baseball calendars start with Monday and go
through Sunday.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Baseball calendars begin on Monday and end on Sunday because teams are scheduled
to play in a city either 2, 3, or 4 days in a row.

Professional baseball takes advantage of the Monday through Sunday schedule so
one team can play another team in what is called a weekend series. The weekend
series is a set of games always scheduled on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and is
always played against the same team.

The Sunday game is usually a day game, so teams can travel to the next city on
the same day, if necessary. If possible, Monday is scheduled as a day off and is
considered an off day where no game is scheduled.
