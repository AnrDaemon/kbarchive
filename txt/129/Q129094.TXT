======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: This problem exists only when running the above versions of Microsoft
Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, under Windows 95 M8 Beta.

SYMPTOMS
========

The Visual C++ version 2.0 and 2.1 menu editor causes a general protection (GP)
fault in the M8 beta of Windows 95 when adding a separator to a top level menu
or opening a menu resource with a separator in the top level menu.

RESOLUTION
==========

If it is necessary to edit a resource that contains a top-level menu separator,
you must open the <project>.rc file in a text editor and remove the
top-level menu separators. Then you can use the Resource Editor to edit a menu
resource.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in Visual C++ version
2.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This bug is best observed in the following two scenarios.

Scenario One - Steps to Reproduce Problem
-----------------------------------------

1. Generate an AppWizard application and select 'Both container and server' in
   the step 3 property page.

2. Open the <project>.rc file.

3. Open the menu folder.

4. Open the menu with the ID IDR_<project>TYPE_CNTR_IP.

A GP fault will now occur in Visual C++. Choose <Close> because
<Ignore> will cause Windows 95 to hang.

Scenario Two - Steps to Reproduce Problem
-----------------------------------------

1. Repeat steps 1 through 3 from Scenario One.

2. Open any menu.

3. Open the properties box for the empty menu item, and add a separator by
   clearing the Popup checkbox and checking Separator.

A GP fault will now occur in Visual C++. Choose <Close> because
<Ignore> will cause Windows 95 to hang.
