TITLE   :Error 4266: WINS Connection Limit Reached
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) servers with the option set to "replicate
on address change" occasionally experience error 4266 in the error log, and show
increased CPU utilization.

CAUSE
=====

A WINS server sends a "push with propagate" message on an address change if the
"replicate on address change" parameter is set (this can be set or cleared
through WINS manager). If the push makes its way back to this WINS server after
traversing two or more other WINS servers, it will be re- propagated by the
original WINS server if that server pulls records from any of the WINS servers
the message traversed.

This is because any time WINS pulls records as a result of a "trigger with
propagate", it propagates the new information that it has pulled to its push
partners. So, under heavy registration/release traffic conditions, the
propagation can go on until one of the WINS servers in the loop (receiving this
propagated trigger) determines that there is nothing to pull. That is, its
information is as current as the pushing WINS server's. When this happens the
push propagation stops.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
