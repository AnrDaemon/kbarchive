SUMMARY
=======

The following information discusses tools and procedures available for
diagnosing and troubleshooting problems with the Digiboard C/CON 16 while the
device is operational.

The C/CON 16 control panel (located in the front of the device) contains 10 LED
indicators, a 2 digit LED display, and two buttons that are useful in diagnosing
and monitoring problems and functions of the concentrator.

The following is a visual description of the Digiboard C/CON 16 control panel:

MORE INFORMATION
================

The push buttons at the right of the control panel are used to access twenty
display modes, by pushing the left or right arrow buttons.

The table below describes these modes in detail.

When AC (activity) is shown on the 2 digit LED, the ten LEDs flash from left to
right. The speed of this strobing effect indicates the overall activity of the
device.

1-16 shows the channels from 1 through 16. Under these modes, the LEDs act the
same as a line monitor.

NOTE: If the push buttons are pressed simultaneously, software flow control is
turned off.

PC displays the Packet Count on the LEDs as a binary count of total packet count
that are received or transmitted. The low byte is the left most LED (TD).

EC displays the Error Count (total errors) in binary. Pressing both push buttons
at once resets the count to zero.

PU describes the Process Utilization. The LEDs are used as a bar graph showing
the concentrator's processor time in percentage. From the left, each LED
increments the PU by 10 percent.

LU describes the Line Utilization. The LEDs are used as a bar graph showing the
concentrator's processor time in percentage. From the left, each LED increments
the PU by 10 percent.

1n, 2n, 3n, 4n, 5n, 6n, 7n, and 8n show the node number of the concentrator. The
LEDs function just as they do in AC mode.
