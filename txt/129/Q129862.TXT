The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Files created in applications other than Visual FoxPro can be stored and
activated in the Visual FoxPro Project Manager. Use the Other Tab in the Project
manager to store file types that are not native to Visual FoxPro.

If you add a file that was created by an application that is registered in the
Windows registration database or maintained in the registry under the
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key in Windows NT, double-clicking or highlighting the file
and then choosing the Modify button invokes the document's associated
application, with the selected file open.

For example, you can store a Microsoft Word document in a Visual FoxPro project,
and double-click the file in Visual FoxPro to launch Microsoft Word with the
desired document open.
