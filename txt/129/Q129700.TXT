SYMPTOMS
========

A project containing a class module with a large number (approximately 2000) of
public class module variables will run successfully in the IDE but will cause an
"Out of memory" error when you attempt to compile the project to make an
executable file.

CAUSE
=====

There is a limit to the number of public members you can put in a class module.
The out of memory error is caused by exceeding the type library's (object
library) capacity limit for definitions. When making an executable file, Visual
Basic creates a type library and creates a typeinfo (an object description) for
all the basic classes. The public members of the class are moved to the typeinfo
in the type library. There is a limit (approximately 1100 members) to the number
of definitions that you can have in a module.

RESOLUTION
==========

Limit the number of public members in a class.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
