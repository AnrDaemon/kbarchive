TITLE   :Artist: Pictures Print Black & White, Not Grayscale or Color
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.1,1.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a color document from Fine Artist using the Fast Print Option,
you may receive black-and-white output on your color or grayscale printer.

CAUSE
=====

The default printer setting is In Speckly Black & White. When you select the
Fast Print Option (the Toaster with a cloud of dust, on the left), you have no
opportunity to change the setting.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, change the printer setting within Fine Artist using the
following steps:

1. Start Fine Artist and open the document.

2. Choose the Print Toaster.

3. On the secondary bank of Toasters, choose the Print Toaster on the right,
   with McZee behind it.

4. Choose the desired print options in each balloon. Continue to the How Would
   You Like Me To Print Your Picture balloon. Select the In Color (if you have a
   color printer) or Using Shades Of Gray option.

5. Print and save the document. The print setting changes you made are saved
   with the document.

After following these steps, you should be able to print this document in color
(or in shades of gray) each time you print using either the Fast Print Option
(toaster with cloud of dust) or from the Print Choices Option (toaster with
McZee behind it).

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior commonly occurs with documents using backgrounds, but not all
backgrounds print in black and white as the default -- only the documents that
were saved with this setting print in black and white.

Another workaround for this problem is to open all the backgrounds, print each of
them in color through the Choices Print Option and then save them.

NOTE: Documents are saved to either the hard disk drive or a floppy disk.
Therefore, for this method to work, you must open each background from the
specific user's group of documents (not from the "Backgrounds" folders on the
CD).

These backgrounds print In Speckly Black & White by default:

 - City Backgrounds - 5 Musicians, Imaginopolis, Town

 - Fantasy Backgrounds - Castle, Moonscape

 - Home Backgrounds - Attic, House Section, Houses, Treehouse, Yard

 - Habitat Backgrounds - Beehive, Cave, Jungle, Mountain

 - Recreational Backgrounds - A Picture Show Title, Beach, Big Wave, Brook,
   Camp, Desert, Lighthouse, Ranch

 - Sports Backgrounds - Basketball Front, Basketball Side, Ski Slope
