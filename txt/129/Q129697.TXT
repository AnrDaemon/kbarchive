PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.10 3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform an unattended upgrade of Windows NT version 3.1 to Windows NT
version 3.5 using the Windows NT version 3.5 Resource Kit utility, SETUPMGR.EXE,
and the TCP/IP protocol, the upgrade stops and requests that you select either
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or static IP address configuration.

RESOLUTION
==========

SETUPMGR.EXE is a utility included in Windows NT Resource Kit version 3.5. If
you have Systems Management Server version 1.0, use NTUPGRAD.SCR instead of
UNATTEND.TXT with SETUPMGR.EXE. If you do not have Systems Management Server
version 1.0, create a NTUPGRAD.SCR file using a text editor such as Notepad as
follows:

   [Unattended]
   Method = <custom | express>
   ConfirmHardware = <yes | no>
   NtUpgrade = <manual | yes | no | single>
   Win31Upgrade = <yes | no>
   TargetPath = <manual | * | [path]>

   [GuiUnattended]
   !UpgradeEnableDhcp = <YES | NO>
   !DetachedProgram =
   !Arguments =
   !ProductId =

For parameter and switch information for the entries above, see NATTEND.SCR if
you have Systems Management Server 1.0. If not, see UNATTEND.TXT (shipped with
Windows NT Resource Kit version 3.5).

NOTE: The Resource Kit utilities are shipped as is. Send any comments regarding
Resource Kit utilities to rkinput@microsoft.com.
