PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Intel ProShare version 1.8 stops responding (hangs) when you try to access data
on a remote computer.

CAUSE
=====

To use ProShare's sharing capabilities in Windows 95, you must use a Windows 3.1
video driver on each workstation running ProShare.

The Windows 95 32-bit video drivers use different internal data structures that
may cause ProShare to hang.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use either of the following methods:

 - Upgrade to ProShare version 1.9a or later.

 - Install and use a Windows 3.1 video driver on each workstation running
   ProShare. Microsoft does not guarantee that Windows 3.1 video drivers will
   work correctly in Windows 95.

   For additional information about using Windows 3.1 video drivers in Windows
   95, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
