SUMMARY
=======

Japanese characters (Hiragana and Katakana characters) can be used as
accelerators under Japanese Windows when a Japanese keyboard is present.

To support a Hiragana or Katakana accelerator as well as the usual English
character accelerator in an Windows application, use the flags \36 and \37 in
the RC file. Place the \36 flag in front of the English character, and place the
\37 flag in front of the Hiragana or Katakana character.

For example, say you want the accelerator key for "File(&F)" to be 'F' on the
101 keyboard and to be the Katakana 'FU' ( 0x8374), which is the first Katakana
character of "file" in Japanese, on the Japanese keyboard. To do this, include
the following in the RC file:

      POPUP "File(\36F\37FU)"
      BEGIN
      ...
      END

Please note that 'FU' is one Katakana character.

Additional query words: shortcut Kanji 106
