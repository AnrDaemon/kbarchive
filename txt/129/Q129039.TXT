SUMMARY
=======

Services for Macintosh provides seed routing support for multiple AppleTalk
networks. Seed routers broadcast routing information and keep track of and
direct data packets on AppleTalk networks. This article discusses situations
when seed routing is not necessary.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Seed routing is not required:

 - If you have a flat network.

   A flat network is described as a network existing wholly on a single physical
   network that consists only of a single default zone. A flat network is also
   described as a bridged network connecting multiple physical segments that
   still only have a single existing zone.

 - If you already have a zone list during the installation of AppleTalk.

   This indicates that you have another router that is Windows NT-based,
   NetWare-based, or hardware-based that provides seed routing (such as Cisco or
   Wellfleet). It is not recommended to have more than one seed router in a
   single network.
