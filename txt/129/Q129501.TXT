The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks uses the following AppleTalk protocols:

 - Name Binding Protocol (NBP)
   NBP provides name lookup in the internet names directory service.

 - AppleTalk Transaction Protocol (ATP)
   ATP provides a reliable loss-free transport service using a transaction
   request and a transaction response to deliver data reliably.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you communicate with other Microsoft Mail servers, and users signed into
the server, a Mail server uses the AppleTalk Transaction Protocol. Server to
server messages include user's mail messages, user lists, group expansions, and
other server related information. User requests and replies to these requests by
the server also use ATP.

A Mail server uses NBP to look for Mail servers on a Network Scan and to verify
that a server still exists on the Mail network. NBP is also used by the
Macintosh Chooser when a user clicks the MS Mail icon, or the Network Manager
clicks the MS Mail GW icon.
