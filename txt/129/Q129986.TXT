-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the Microsoft Network Client is configured to use the TCP/IP protocol,
and you try to start the SOCKETS.EXE program, the following error message
may appear:

   SOCKETS0101: The value for keyword HOSTNAME not found in TCPUTILS.INI file by
   SOCKETS. (not loaded)

This message appears because SOCKETS is looking for a host name in the
TCPUTILS.INI file. To run SOCKETS, manually enter a host name.

In the TCPUTILS.INI file, add the following line to the [tcpglobal]
section:

   " hostname=<hostname> " (without the quotation marks)

where <hostname> is a valid host name (but any value will allow SOCKETS.EXE
to start).

Additional query words: workgroup
