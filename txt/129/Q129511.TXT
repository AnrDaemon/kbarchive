TITLE   :PRB: "Property Command Not Found" Error When Modifying Caption
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The error "Property Command Not Found" is displayed when you try to modify the
caption of a command button in a command button group. The code used to access
the command button is:

      FOR I = 1 TO 10
       THISFORM.CommandGroup1.Command(I).Caption = "test"+ALLTRIM(STR(I))
      ENDFOR

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro cannot interpret the reference made to Command(x). It is reading
it literally, expecting an array member called command. The "Property Not Found"
error message (error 1734) is displayed when a property cannot be located. It is
sometimes the direct result of a typing error, and can be displayed if you are
trying to access an object or a property.

RESOLUTION
==========

In this specific case, you can use the Buttons collection to access every
command button of a command group. For example, you can place the following code
in the Init of the Command Group:

      FOR I=1 to THISFORM.CommandGroup1.ButtonCount
        THISFORM.CommandGroup1.Buttons(I).Caption="TEST"+ALLTRIM(STR(I))
      ENDFOR

You can also evaluate the expression that returns the command button name as
follows:

      FOR I=1 to THISFORM.CommandGroup1.ButtonCount
        oRef=EVAL("THISFORM.CommandGroup1.Command"+ALLTRIM(STR(I)))
        oRef.Caption="TEST"+ALLTRIM(STR(I))
      ENDFOR

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To isolate the source of the problem when you receive a "Property Not Found"
error message during program execution, you can suspend execution of the
program. If the object has been created, you can use the AMEMBERS() function or
the DISPLAY OBJECT command to verify the name of properties and object members.
For example:

       DISPLAY OBJECT LIKE Thisform
