PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run an application that reads in text files and depends on carriage
return Hex 0D or CHR$(13) at the end of each line of text, the application may
fail when it reads text files created from NET commands.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 3.5 places only a linefeed Hex 0A, or CHR$(10), at the end of each
line of text generated from the NET commands.


WORKAROUND
==========

If possible, modify the application you are using to look for Hex 0A or CHR$(10)
at the end of each line (instead of the Hex 0D or CHR$(13)).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
