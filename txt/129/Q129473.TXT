-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft 500 Nations, version 1.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT, on platform(s):
       - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you copy pictures from the Picture Gallery in Microsoft 500 Nations, the
image does not paste correctly into Microsoft Windows Write and other
applications that do not support palette control.

RESOLUTION
==========

Pictures copied from Picture Gallery need to be pasted into an application that
understands color palettes (such as Microsoft Word for Windows or Windows 95
Paint). To use the Picture Gallery, choose the Options menu in 500 Nations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following text is included in the 500 Nations README.TXT under the section
titled printing and copying:

   If you copy a picture from 500 Nations, and paste it into another Windows
   application, you may encounter palette problems (the picture will have
   incorrect colors). This is because some Windows applications (like Write and
   Paintbrush) don't support full color palette control. For example, you can
   get a correct color image by pasting into an application that supports color
   control such as Paint in Windows 95, or Microsoft Word for Windows.
