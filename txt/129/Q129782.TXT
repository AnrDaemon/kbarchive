TITLE   :FIX: MFCN30.DLL and MFCN30D.DLL Not Copied with Win32S Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbMFC kbVC kbVC210 kbWinsock kbGrpDSMFCATL

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to run an MFC application that uses the socket classes generates the
following File Error under Win32s:

   Cannot find MFCN30D.DLL

Then when you click the Close button, the following error appears:

   Cannot Run Program
   Unexpected error: 21.

NOTE: A release build of an application would list MFCN30.DLL instead of
MFCN30D.DLL in the first message box.

CAUSE
=====

The Win32S setup included on the Visual C++ CD does not copy MFCN30.DLL or
MFCN30D.DLL.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy MFCN30.DLL and MFCN30D.DLL from the CD to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory of
the Win32S machine:

 - MFCN30.DLL can be found on the CD in this directory: \MSVC20\REDIST

 - MFCN30D.DLL can be found on the CD in this directory: \MSVC20\DEBUG

If your application has a set-up program, make sure it also copies these files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
32-bit Edition, version 2.2.
