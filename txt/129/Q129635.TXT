SUMMARY
=======

Predefined collections such as fields and forms are 0-based. User-defined
collections declared as New Collection are 1-based. It is not possible to use an
Option Base statement to set the default base to 0 or any other number because a
collection is not an array. This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A collection is an object that contains a set of related objects called members
of the collection. A member object's position in the collection can change
whenever a change occurs in the collection. Therefore, the position of any
specific object in the collection may vary. It is recommended not to use
collection indices for iteration because they are not guaranteed to be
contiguous.

If you use the For Each construct to iterate through the members of the
collection, the base of the collection doesn't matter.
