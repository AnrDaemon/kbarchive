SUMMARY

This article describes how to access the Microsoft Knowledge Base on the World
Wide Web.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Knowledge Base is a primary Microsoft product information source
that Microsoft support professionals use to help customers. This source is also
available to Microsoft customers. This comprehensive database includes more than
250,000 detailed articles containing technical information about Microsoft
products, fix lists, documentation errors, and answers to commonly asked
technical support questions. These articles are also available through the
Microsoft TechNet CD and the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) CD.

Connecting to the Microsoft World Wide Web site requires a "live" session to the
Internet through an Internet service provider.
