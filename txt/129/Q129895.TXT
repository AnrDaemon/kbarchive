TITLE   :PRB: OPTION PRIVATE Statement Has No Effect in Visual Basic
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbVBp400

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the statement Option Private when declaring a module does not affect the
behavior of a Visual Basic version 4.0 application in any way.

CAUSE
=====

The Option Private statement is not implemented in Visual Basic version 4.0. It
is useful only in applications that support multiple projects loaded
simultaneously and allow references between the loaded projects, as Microsoft
Excel version 5.0 does for example. The statement makes it impossible to access
members of the module from a referencing project even if the member is declared
public.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. Because Visual Basic version 4.0 doesn't support
multiple loaded projects, this statement has no use.
