SUMMARY
=======

The first time you start one of the programs listed in the applies to section of
this article in Microsoft Windows 95/98, the program runs in full-screen mode,
hiding the Windows taskbar.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The behavior is by design. Other programs capable of full-screen video operation
function the same way in Windows 95/98.

Even when you configure the taskbar properties to show the taskbar at all times,
the taskbar is not shown when the program is running in full-screen mode.

Additional query words: multi multi-media media mmtitles task bar
