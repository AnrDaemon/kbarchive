SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how you can register a third-party Wizard in Visual
FoxPro.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The _WIZARD System Memory Variable determines which application will act as the
main controller for all the wizards. By default, WIZARD.APP is assigned to this
variable, and each time you choose to run a wizard, this application is
activated. Although you can create and use your own application instead of
WIZARD.APP, Microsoft does not recommend it.

WIZARD.APP uses the WIZARD.DBF table to register the various wizards. This table
determines which wizard is associated with which type of file or tool. This is
where you can enter information about a third-party wizard.

Each record in WIZARD.DBF represents a wizard. Once the information is entered,
WIZARD.APP will be able to find the wizard and run it for a specified type of
file or tool. The PROGRAM field contains the name and path of the Wizard program
and the TYPE field contains the information about the type of file or tool
associated with the wizard.

For example, if you enter a third-party Wizard named MYWIZ.APP with a FORM entry
in the TYPE field, the MYWIZ.APP will be run any time you try to create a new
form.
