TITLE   :PRB: GETDIR() Doesn't Behave as Expected Under System 7.5
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,2.5c,2.6a,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The GETDIR() function should display the Select Directory dialog from which a
directory or folder can be chosen. It takes two arguments <expC1> and
<expC2>. The first argument <expC1> specifies the folder that is
initially displayed in the Select Directory dialog. The second argument
<expC2> is the prompt for the folder in the Select Directory dialog. In
FoxPro for Macintosh and Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, specifying the folder that
is displayed initially does not behave as expected if running System 7.5 or
System 7.5.3.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs on System 7.5 and System 7.5.3.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. It is caused by a setting in the "General Controls"
Control Panel on System 7.5. "General Controls" contains a section indicating
where to open and save documents. This setting overrides the SET DEFAULT and
other specified directories in FoxPro functions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. From the File menu, choose Open, and notice the currently selected (or
   default) folder. (The default folder should be Microsoft FoxPro 2.6 or
   Microsoft Visual FoxPro unless you have specified otherwise in the CONFIG.FPM
   file.)

2. Click Cancel.

3. In the Command window, issue this command:

      =GETDIR("MAC HD:Microsoft FoxPro 2.6:Tutorial")

   * or any valid Visual Foxpro folder

4. The Select Directory dialog opens. However, the folder displayed is not
   Tutorial. It is displaying the default or last working folder.

NOTE: Issuing a SET DEFAULT TO <desired folder name> before issuing the
GETDIR() function does not change the initial folder displayed.
