TITLE   :HOWTO: How to Convert FoxPro 3.0 Tables to FoxPro 2.x Format
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Tables created in Visual FoxPro are not compatible with previous versions of
FoxPro, and the current FoxPro Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers only
work with FoxPro 2.x tables.

To work around this, use Visual FoxPro's COPY TO command with the TYPE FOX2X
clause to convert its tables to the FoxPro 2.x format.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Beginning with Visual FoxPro 3.0, the COPY TO command has a TYPE FOX2X clause.
This clause is used in Visual FoxPro to convert Visual FoxPro tables to a format
recognizable by previous versions of FoxPro. kbprg kbinterop kbtshoot kbprb

Example Workaround
------------------

1. Open an existing Visual FoxPro table

2. Issue the following command in the Command window:

         COPY TO <table name> TYPE FOX2X

Issues When Converting from 3.0 to 2.x
--------------------------------------

 - Any rules, triggers, captions, comments, or default values created for the
   Visual FoxPro table will not be available in FoxPro 2.X

 - Null values stored within the Visual FoxPro table will be converted to blank
   values in FoxPro 2.x. For Numeric, Float, Integer, Double and Currency data
   types, null values in the source table will be converted to zero.

 - A Visual FoxPro field with the data type of Currency or Double will be
   converted to Float in FoxPro 2.X. Numeric precision may be lost for large
   values stored in Double fields.

 - A Visual FoxPro field with the data type of DateTime will be converted to
   Date in FoxPro 2.x. The time portion of the DateTime field will be lost in
   the conversion.

 - A Visual FoxPro field with the data type of Integer will be converted to
   Numeric in FoxPro 2.x.
