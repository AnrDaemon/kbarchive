If you add an exclusion to the DHCP scope after a lease is removed
from the active leases list, but before the expiration date has
expired, the following error appears:

   The specified range either overlaps with an already existing range or is
   invalid.


To work around this problem, wait until the expiration time has passed for
the address and then add it to the exclusion list.
