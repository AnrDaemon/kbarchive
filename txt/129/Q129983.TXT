TITLE   :Compression Statistics Not Displayed in RAS Admin With SP2
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.10 3.11 3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT Remote Access (RAS) Admin application displays incorrect software
compression statistics for a port servicing a downlevel RAS client.

In Windows NT 3.5 with Service Pack 2 installed, the compression statistics
displayed by RAS Admin will display as 0%, even though software compression has
been negotiated by the RAS client and server and the downlevel RAS client
displays the correct software compression statistics.

NOTE: Windows NT 3.5 with Service Pack 2 installed supports RAS software
compression for downlevel clients such as Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and
Windows NT 3.1.

NOTE: For more information on RAS compression compatibility with Windows for
Workgroups and Windows NT 3.1, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem has been corrected in Windows NT 3.51.
