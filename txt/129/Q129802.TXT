TITLE   :PRB: Can't Have Fixed Length Strings >32K in 32-bit Windows
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbprogramming kbVBp400 kb32bitOnly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to create fixed-length strings within a user-defined type in the
32-bit version of Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 generates this error:

   "Fixed or static data can't be larger than 64K"

CAUSE
=====

Because 32-bit Microsoft Visual Basic uses Unicode to store strings and Unicode
requires two bytes per character in a string, fixed-length strings take twice as
many bytes of storage as the 16-bit versions of Visual Basic. If you assign or
dimension more that 32K characters to a string, the storage actually exceeds the
64K limit of Visual Basic user-defined types.

RESOLUTION
==========

Larger strings can be assigned to string elements of user-defined types by using
variable-length strings instead of fixed-length strings.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a code module (Module1) to your project by choosing Module from the
   Insert menu.

3. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Module1:

         Type MyType
            MyString As String * 33000
         End Type

4. Start the program by choosing Start from the Run menu or by pressing the F5
   key. You should see the following run-time error message:

   "Fixed or static data can't be larger than 64K"

Additional query words: double byte character set dbcs
