TITLE   :Buffering Must Be Handled Manually in DBC Rules/Triggers
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you choose to use update, delete, or insert triggers within a Visual FoxPro
database container (DBC), buffering will not be enabled automatically. You must
use the =CURSORSETPROP() function to manually enable the type of buffering
desired.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design. Because automatic implementation of buffering could
cause adverse consequences in some situations, buffering will be set to 1 (no
buffering).

Normally, you would choose to implement row buffering on the parent table, and
table buffering on the child table involved in the relationship.

REFERENCES
==========

For more information on database design and buffering, refer to the Microsoft
Visual FoxPro "Developer's Guide" or to the Microsoft Visual FoxPro
"Professional Features Guide."
