TITLE   :FIX: ODBC Driver for DB2 Maps DATE Fields to Text When You Link
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhis2000 kbhis2000bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2 to link a table from Microsoft Access
(all versions), you may get incorrect values when the selected fields are
defined as DATE data type fields.

CAUSE
=====

The Micorosft ODBC Driver for DB2 is returning a SQL_TYPE_DATE,TIME,TIMESTAMP
data type.

This data type is not known by Microsoft Access (all versions), because Access is
only ODBC 2.0 compliant. Microsoft Access maps this data type to the default
data type TEXT.

RESOLUTION
==========

Host Integration Server 2000
----------------------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to

recommends that you wait for the next Host Integration Server 2000 service pack
that contains this fix.

to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
