The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Visual FoxPro, versions 7.0.0.9262, 7.0.0.9465 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS

The Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Visual FoxPro can access Visual FoxPro data
from Microsoft Visual Studio .NET projects. When you use the OleDbDataAdapter
object from the System.Data.OleDb namespace, and your SQL SELECT statement
returns an empty Visual FoxPro memo field, you receive the following error
message:

   Multiple-step OLE DB operation generated errors. Check each OLE DB status
   value, if available. No work was done.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

On a computer that has Visual Studio .NET and the OLE DB Provider for Visual
FoxPro installed (version 7.0.0.9262 or 7.0.0.9465), follow these steps:

1. In Visual Studio .NET, create a new Microsoft Visual Basic .NET Console
   Application project.

2. Replace the default Module1 code with the following:

   Imports System.Data.OleDb

   Module Module1

       Sub Main()
           ' Demonstrates a problem with the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Visual FoxPro
           ' interacting with the OleDbDataAdapter object and empty FoxPro memo fields.
           Dim ThisDir As String = System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory
           Dim oConn As New OleDbConnection("Provider=VFPOLEDB.1;Data Source=" & ThisDir)
           Dim oCMD As New OleDbCommand()
           Dim oDA As New OleDbDataAdapter("SELECT fldMEMO FROM Q326544", oConn)
           Dim oDS As New DataSet()

           ' Create a Visual FoxPro table with one memo field, and then insert a blank record.
           With oCMD
               .Connection = oConn
               .Connection.Open()
               .CommandType = CommandType.Text
               .CommandText = "CREATE TABLE Q326544 (fldMEMO M)"
               .ExecuteNonQuery()
               .CommandText = "INSERT INTO Q326544 VALUES ([])"
               .ExecuteNonQuery()
               .Connection.Close()
           End With

           Try
               oDA.Fill(oDS)
           Catch oER As Exception
               MsgBox(oER.Message)
           End Try

           oDA.Dispose()
           oConn.Close()
           oConn.Dispose()
           oCMD.Dispose()
       End Sub
   End Module

3. Press F5 to run the project.

You receive the error message that is described in the "Symptoms" section.
