   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to control the running state of the threads of the
SMS_EXECITVE service without using the SMS Service Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

You can use the registry change the state of each thread installed on a Systems
Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Site. This is useful when the SMS Service Manager
will not make a connection. NOTE: Microsoft recommends that you use the SMS
Service Manager To stop or start threads of SMS_EXECUTIVE, if you can.

To change the state of threads of the SMS_EXECITVE service, follow these steps:

1. In the registry, locate the following key:

   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_EXECUTIVE\Threads

   Each thread installed at the site is listed by its full name, for example:

   SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER

   When you click the thread name, the right pane of Registry Editor displays a
   list of values for this subkey.

   The values that you are looking for are "Requested Operation" and "Current
   State".

   NOTE: For a running thread component, the data for the "Requested Operation"
   value is "None" and the data for "Current State" is "Running".

2. To stop running components, change "Requested Operation" to "Stop".

   To start stopped components, change "Requested Operation" to "Start".

   The changes to the components take effect immediately.
