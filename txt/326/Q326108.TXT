TITLE   :PCL Codes are Ignored After You Install Host Integration Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Ignored Printer Control Language (PCL) codes are printed at the top of the first
page after you install Host Integration Server Print Sessions by using the
SNACFG utility.

PCL codes that are similar to the following are printed:

     &l6D&k2S&l63F&d@(s0B&k0S(0NE&l1o4.3c8e88P&l2A(s16.67H

CAUSE
=====

The PCL codes are ignored because the print sessions were not created through
the SNA Manager interface.

By creating the print sessions using the SNACFG command line tool, the underlying
devmode structure of the print server session becomes corrupt. As a result,
embedded PCL codes under 0x40 are converted to spaces, which is the default
behavior if a character is unrecognized by Host Integration Server 2000.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem so that host print jobs that contain PCL codes are
processed and the data prints correctly, follow these steps:

1. Right-click SNA Print Service, and then click Properties.

2. Click to select the "Ignore Characters 3F and Under" check box, and then
   click Apply.

3. Click to clear the "Ignore Characters 3F and Under" check box, click Apply,
   and then click OK.

4. Save the configuration.

5. Resend the print job. It prints correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Host Integration Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PCL commands are escape codes that can be embedded by the Mainframe Host into
the 3270 printer data stream. These PCL commands give instructions to the
printer on how to format the print job.

When this problem occurs, SNA Print Internal traces (SPRTINTx.ATF) shows that the
EBCDIC 0x27 Escape Character is converted to an ASCII 0x20 Space instead of an
ASCII 1B Escape Character:
