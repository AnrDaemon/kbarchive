TITLE   :BUG: MDM Agent System Does Not Power Off
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Server Appliance Kit (SAK) Add On Pack Version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Shutdown Job is performed on the Multiple Device Manager (MDM)
controller, the agent system does not turn off. Instead, the agent system stops
at the "It is now safe to turn off your computer" message.

CAUSE
=====

The agent uses the InitiateSystemShutdown application programming interface
(API) for the shutdown job. InitiateSystemShutdown does not completely power off
a computer that is running Microsoft Windows 2000.
