The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the behavior of a Logical Unit Application (LUA) session
allocation when a 3270 client that is configured for TN3270 specifies the server
name or IP address and pool name when using multiple TN3270 services.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All 3270 clients that are configured in TN3270 mode and that specify a server
name or IP address and LUA pool acquire an LUA logical unit (LU) from the server
or IP address that the client specified.

For example:

 - Server A and server B are in the same SNA Subdomain.

 - Available LUA LUs from both servers are assigned to a common LUA pool named
   LUAPOOL.

 - LUAPOOL is assigned to both TN3270 Services on server A and server B.

 - A 3270 client specifying server A using LUAPOOL will always acquire an LUA LU
   from server A until all LUA LUs are used up from server A. After that, LUA
   LUs are pulled from server B.

If the TN3270 service or server A is inactive or unavailable, the 3270 client
will not acquire an LUA LU from server B. Instead, you receive an error similar
to the following:

   Host Connection Timed Out.
