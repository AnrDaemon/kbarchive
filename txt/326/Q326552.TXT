SUMMARY
=======

The Web Client that is included with SNA Server and Host Integration Server 2000
is not supported when you run the 3270 and 5250 emulators in Telnet (TN) mode.
That is, when you run the emulators in either TN3270 or TN5250 mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 3270 and 5250 emulators that are included with SNA Server and Host
Integration Server allow support for the following two interfaces:

 - Native SNA Server or Host Integration Server client/server interface
 - TN interface

Configure the Interface for the Emulator
----------------------------------------

In the emulator for which you want to configure the interface, on the
Session/Session configuration menu, click the option that you want as follows:

 - For the 5250 emulator:

    - To configure for native SNA mode, click Microsoft SNA Service.

    - To configure for TN mode, click TN 5250.

 - For the 3270 emulator:

    - To configure for native SNA mode, click SNA Server Connection.

    - To configure for TN mode, click TN3270E Server Connection.

The Web Client that is included with SNA Server and Host Integration Server is
intended to distribute and configure the 3270 and 5250 clients to use the native
SNA Server or Host Integration Server client/server interface.
