The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

IMPORTANT: All Microsoft Mail version 2.00 customers who have gateways installed
should be using the "MS Mail GW" file version 2.00b and the "Microsoft Mail
Server" file version 2.00b, both of which are located in the System Folder of
the Mail server. An updated "MS Mail GW" file is available through Microsoft End
User Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400 or Microsoft International Customer
Service at (206) 936-8661, but ONLY for customers using the AppleLink Gateway to
Microsoft Mail. Customers using other gateways must obtain an updated "MS Mail
GW" file from the developer of the gateway they are using. The Microsoft Mail
server upgrade can also be obtained at the above numbers.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is important information to know and consider when adding users to
a gateway account:

1. You cannot add a group to a gateway account to give everyone in the group
   access to the gateway. This feature is not supported. You must add each user
   individually. See #2 below for more information.

2. When you click the Define button in the Define Gateway Accounts window, the
   name that is highlighted in the list of users is the "default user." This
   user receives all of the mail coming into the gateway from the external mail
   service for that account. If the default user is a group, everyone in the
   group receives a copy of the mail message.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.00a 2.00b 3.00
