The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, MS-DOS workstation, versions 1.37, 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail (PC Client) supports the Hercules InColor graphics card through
the use of a special video driver called HERCCLR.VID, which is provided on the
original Mail disks. The size of the HERCCLR.VID file is dependent upon the
version of the Mail PC Client you are using, as shown below:

   Version     Size of HERCCLR.VID
   -------     -------------------

   1.37        13712 bytes
   2.00        14131 bytes
   3.00        14131 bytes

When you run the Mail Setup program, it will perform tests against your graphics
card. If it detects a Hercules InColor card, it will copy the video driver
HERCCLR.VID to the Mail program directory and rename it SCREEN.VID.

If there is a SCREEN.VID file in the Mail program directory, the information in
the SCREEN.VID file will be used to properly draw the screen while your mailbox
is open.
