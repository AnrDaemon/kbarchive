SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a "Microsoft Network or Compatible," and you connect to two network
printers on the same server and print to one of them, the print job appears
twice in the Print Manager network queue listings.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The double listing occurs because of the way the Microsoft
Redirector networks handle print queues. The queue is managed on a per server,
not per printer, basis. Therefore, both printer listings in Print Manager
reflect the same server print queue, and the job is shown twice.
