OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

A single Tandy joystick plugged into a built-in game port of a Tandy 1000 SL
computer reportedly does not work correctly with Flight Simulator version 4.00.
If a second Tandy joystick is plugged into the other built-in game port, both
joysticks will function correctly.

This problem has also been reported with the Tandy 1000 TX. It has also been
reported that plugging a second joystick in will also correct the problem.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
