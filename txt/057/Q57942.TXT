SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft products listed above, if a number of compiler warning messages
contain the description "UNKNOWN WARNING", or if the error number is displayed
with no message, the cause may be the use of an incorrect or corrupted error
message file. The compiler generates the correct error number, but because the
messages are retrieved from a separate file, the compiler displays either no
text or "UNKNOWN WARNING" when it cannot find a match.

In 16-bit Visual C++ version 1.0, these messages may also occur if there are not
enough file handles available. Increasing the number set by the FILES= line in
the CONFIG.SYS file may solve the problem.

The error message files for the C compiler should contain messages for all errors
and warnings generated. If you look up the number of a compiler error in the
documentation and find a normally documented error, then you should be
suspicious of your .ERR error message files.

RESOLUTION
==========

The simplest check is to reinstall the error message files--CL.ERR, C1.ERR, and
C23.ERR--from the original disks and then recompile to see if the error messages
appear correctly. The required steps vary depending on the compiler you are
using.

 - For Microsoft C versions 6.0x, put the Setup Disk in a disk drive, make it
   the current drive, and type "setup /copy" (without the quotation marks) at
   the MS-DOS command prompt. Setup prompts for the name of the file to copy
   from the distribution disks and the name of the destination directory on your
   hard disk.

 - For Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0, use the CSETUP.EXE program to copy the
   files.

 - For Visual C++ version 1.0 and above distributed on diskettes, locate the
   desired files on the Visual C++ disks and use the EXPAND.EXE utility to copy
   and decompress the files. (For help with EXPAND.EXE, type "EXPAND /?"
   (without the quotation marks) and press <Enter> at a command prompt.)
   For Visual C++ version 1.0 and above distributed on CD-ROM, locate the
   desired files on the Visual C++ CD and copy the files directly to the
   destination directory.
