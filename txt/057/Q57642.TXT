SUMMARY
=======

To run Microsoft Windows version 3.0 386 enhanced mode properly on the Everex
Step 386/25 machine, you need to add the following entries to the [386Enh]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

      8042ReadCmd=A2,1,F
      8042ReadCmd=A3,1,F
      8042WriteCmd=B3,8,F

MORE INFORMATION
================

These entries are needed so that the LED front panel display works properly.
These computers have a blinking lights display which usually displays
information about which cylinder on the hard disk is being accessed. The display
is driven by a set of non-standard commands to the 8042 keyboard controller.
Normally the Enhanced mode VKD (Virtual Keyboard Device) just ignores
non-standard commands such as the ones that drive this display. The result is
that when you start Enhanced mode the display suddenly stops working and ceases
to indicate hard disk cylinder access. These SYSTEM.INI entires cause the
display to start working again.

The Everex product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
