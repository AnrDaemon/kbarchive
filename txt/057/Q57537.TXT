SYMPTOMS
========

The Leading Edge D3 using Leading Edge DOS Version 3.30 does not permit the
entry of "Mode CO80" at the command line to allow Microsoft Windows to run with
a monochrome VGA display.

WORKAROUND
==========

This computer is supplied with software from Leading Edge to reconfigure the
graphics adapter to run as a color VGA. The software is supplied on the
Utilities Disk. After reconfiguration, the display is still in monochrome and
Windows works properly.

This has not been tested by Microsoft. For more information, contact Leading
Edge.
