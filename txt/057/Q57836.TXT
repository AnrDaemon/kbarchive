TITLE   :Setting up OS/2 LAN Manager to Use Replicator Service

SUMMARY
=======

The Replicator service is a new feature included in OS/2 LAN Manager versions
2.0 and later. The documentation for the Replicator service is fairly complete,
and documents the two points discussed below; however, these two points can be
somewhat confusing.

In the example listed below, assume the export server is named EXPORT1, and the
import server is named IMPORT1. When starting the Replicator, you should do the
following:

1. Make sure the IMPORT1 account on EXPORT1 (the export server) has "RA"
   authority on the entire C:\LANMAN\REPL\EXPORT tree.

   The easiest way to do this is with the NET ADMIN command. First, authorize
   IMPORT1 (the import server) to just C:\LANMAN\REPL\EXPORT, then after
   clicking Permit you will be returned to a menu where you just click Permit
   tree.

2. On IMPORT1, the import server, do the following

      md c:\lanman\repl\import\subdir1
      md c:\lanman\repl\import\subdir2

   so that the subdirectories IMPORT1 is supposed to import (in this example,
   subdir1, and subdir2) will already exist. The Replicator will not create
   these subdirectories for you, so you must do this yourself. The reason the
   Replicator does not create these subdirectories for you is because this is
   one way to control which, of the potentially many subdirectories an export
   server might export, are actually imported to by a given import server.
