The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Important: All Microsoft Mail version 2.00 customers who have gateways installed
should be using the "MS Mail GW" file version 2.00b and the "Microsoft Mail
Server" file version 2.00b, both of which are located in the System Folder of
the Mail server. An updated "MS Mail GW" file is available through Microsoft End
User Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400 or Microsoft International Customer
Service at (206) 936-8661 but ONLY for customers using the AppleLink Gateway to
Microsoft Mail. Customers using other gateways must obtain an updated "MS Mail
GW" file from the developer of the gateway they are using. The Microsoft Mail
server upgrade can also be obtained at the above numbers.


The following information applies to the AppleLink gateway versions 2.0 and 3.0.

Before configuring the AppleLink gateway, the AppleLink gateway must have
previously been installed on the Microsoft Mail server by using the Gateway
Installer program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure the AppleLink gateway, do the following:

1. On the gateway server, sign in as Network Manager. Although you can sign in
   as Network Manager from any Macintosh on the network, you must do the gateway
   configuration from the gateway server because in step 4 the AppleLink gateway
   needs to access the file "USA Modem.EF3.CCL", which must reside on the
   gateway server.

2. From the Mail menu, choose Gateway Configuration. In Mail version 3.00,
   choose Gateway then Configuration.

3. Click the icon for the AppleLink gateway.

4. Click the button labeled "Connect Via". Select the file named "USA
   Modem.EF3.CCL" and click Open. This is a Command Control Language (CCL) file
   and is used to connect with AppleLink. Users in foreign countries may have to
   use a modified CCL file.

5. Fill in the information for the following:

   a. Phone Type - Pulse (rotary) or Touch-Tone.

   b. Line Speed - Baud rate of the modem being used to connect with AppleLink.

   c. Network Phone # - This is usually the same number you dial when using the
      AppleLink application to dial up AppleLink.

   d. System Number - This field is already filled in for United States users.
      Users in foreign countries usually have to change this to be the same
      System number they use when using the AppleLink application to dial up
      AppleLink.

6. Click the Update button.
