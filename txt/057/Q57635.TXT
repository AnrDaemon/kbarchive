SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows version 3.0 driver for the Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet
and DeskJet Plus printers supports the use of soft fonts. However, the driver
does not download the soft fonts to the printer; the soft fonts must be
downloaded prior to printing by using the standard downloading procedure (that
is, using an MS-DOS batch file). Normally, the instruction to download the fonts
is placed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The fonts must be downloaded as "permanent" to work properly with the Windows
3.0 DeskJet driver, because the driver resets the printer prior to each print
job. If the fonts are not downloaded as permanent, they are erased when the
printer is reset.

When upgrading to the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 over Windows 3.0, soft fonts
that are installed for the Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet printers are not
retained.

To use the soft fonts for the HP DeskJet printers, re-install them through the
Control Panel under Windows 3.1.
