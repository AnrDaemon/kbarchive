SUMMARY
=======

To tune the COM1 radio, perform the following steps:

1. Type "c" and use the PLUS (+) and MINUS (-) keys to adjust the integer
   portion of the frequency.

2. Type "c" twice rapidly and use the PLUS (+) and MINUS (-) keys to adjust the
   fractional part of the frequency. CT or ATIS frequencies can be found on the
   charts in the back of the manual.

To tune the NAV radio, follow Steps 1 and 2 above; however, type "n" rather than
"c", followed by "1" or "2", depending on which NAV radio you are tuning.
Frequencies are given in the charts in the back of the "Microsoft Flight
Simulator Information Manual and Flight Handbook."

To adjust the OBI course selector, follow Steps 1 and 2 above; however, type "v"
rather than "c". Adjust the PLUS (+) and MINUS (-) keys until the cross hair
lies in the center of the gauge.
