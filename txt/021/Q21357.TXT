SUMMARY
=======

To use the NAV radio and OBI for VOR navigation, find out the frequency of the
VOR transmitter for the airport you are interested in. The steps necessary to
perform VOR navigation are as follows:

1. Tune your NAV radio (either 1 or 2) to the VOR frequency. You can get these
   frequencies from the maps provided with Flight Simulator.

2. Adjust the appropriate OBI (use OBI1 with NAV1 and OBI2 with NAV2) until the
   vertical cross hair centers on the OBI gauge. The vertical cross hair can
   center under three conditions: when the OBI is OFF, set to TO, or set to
   FROM. Choose the TO option.

3. Turn the airplane so the magnetic compass has the same degree reading as the
   top of the OBI indicator.

Now, fly the airplane, keeping the needle in the OBI indicator centered. You are
now flying toward the VOR beacon.
