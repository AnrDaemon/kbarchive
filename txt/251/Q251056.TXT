SYMPTOMS
========

If you issue the SET PRINT ON command with the PROMPT clause more than once in
Visual FoxPro, which is running on Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0 or the
Apple Macintosh, the Print dialog box does not appear after issuing the command
the first time.

   SET PRINT ON PROMPT
   SET PRINT OFF
   SET PRINT TO
   SET PRINT ON PROMPT

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On a Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT 4.0 computer that is running
   Visual FoxPro 3.0b, 5.0a, or 6.0 (SP3) with a printer attached, type the
   following in the Command window:

   SET PRINT ON PROMPT

2. When the Print dialog box appears, either press OK, Cancel, or ESC to close
   the dialog box.

3. Issue this command:

   SET PRINT OFF

4. Next, issue this command:

Note that the Print dialog box does not appear after step 4. You must exit Visual
FoxPro and re-issue the SET PRINT ON PROMPT command to see the Print dialog box
again.
