TITLE   :IIS Reserves the ".map" File Extension for Image Maps
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000 kbDSupport kbiis400 kbiis500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ".map" extension is reserved and intended for association with server-side
image maps in Internet Information Server (IIS). Altering the mime type is not
recommended by Microsoft and is ignored in Internet Information Server 4.0.

If a file is larger than 128 KB in size, has the .map extension, and is not an
image map, then you may receive one or more of the following error messages in
the browser:

   HTTP 500 - Internal server error

   -or-

   HTTP/1.1 500 Server Error

   -or-

   Network request is not supported

CAUSE
=====

Internet Information Server assumes all files that have a file extension of .map
are image maps.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use a file type other than ".map".

MORE INFORMATION
================

Other ASCII files that are over 128 KB in size are not effected. If you have a
file with another extension, such as "a01", that is larger than 128 KB, you will
not have problems changing the mime type or viewing it in the browser.
