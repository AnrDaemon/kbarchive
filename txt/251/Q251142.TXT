PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdisplay kbui fsim kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run one of the programs listed at the beginning of this article, you
may experience the following symptoms:

 - When you press the PLUS SIGN (+) key on the number keypad, air traffic
   control (ATC) chatter does not start scrolling across the screen.

 - When you press a key or a button to which you have assigned the "Send ATC
   text message" command, ATC chatter does not start scrolling across the
   screen.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the "Send ATC text message" command is not
available in the programs listed at the beginning of this article, even though
this command is still listed under the "Assignment list" in the Controls
Assignments dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Send ATC text message" command is available in previous versions of
Microsoft Flight Simulator.
