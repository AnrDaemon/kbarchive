TITLE   :XADM: Backup Stops with Events 105 and 145 and Error 1032
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A backup program that is Exchange Server aware may stop, and the following two
events may be logged in the application event log:

   Event Type: Error
   Event Source: ESE97
   Event Category: Logging/Recovery
   Event ID: 105
   Description: MSExchangeIS ((nnn)) The database engine has stopped the backup
   with error -1032.

   Event Type: Error
   Event Source: ESE97
   Event Category: General
   Event ID: 145
   Description: MSExchangeIS ((nnn)) The database engine could not access the
   file called [path]\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\\edbxxxxx.log.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the current backup job conflicts with another backup
job, which may or may not be Exchange Server aware. When the Extensible Storage
Engine (ESE) backup process cannot open a transaction log because there is a
conflicting backup job, ESE97 generates the two events in the "Symptoms" section
of this article, and the backup program stops.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable one of the conflicting backup jobs. You may need to contact the software
vendor to find the conflicting backup job.
