SYMPTOMS
========

While you are attempting to install Microsoft Exchange Server on a Windows 2000
Server-based computer, you may receive the following error message:

   You must be logged into an NT domain to run Microsoft Exchange Server Setup.

This error can also occur if you are installing a new service pack through a
terminal server session on a member server in a NT domain.

WORKAROUND
==========

To attempt to work around this behavior:

 - Ensure that you are logged on to the server with a domain account, not a
   local account.

 - If this does not correct the behavior, check the following registry key:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

   1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

   2. Locate the DefaultDomainName value under the following key in the
      registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

   3. If DefaultDomainName is set to the local computer name, change it to the
      domain name that the computer account is in, and then try to install
      Exchange Server again.

   4. Quit Registry Editor.

STATUS
======
