TITLE   :SMS: Changing Time Zone Recopies Three Core SMS Client Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the time zone on a client computer that is running Microsoft
Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98 and then call Smsls from a logon script, the
following files are recopied to the client computer:

   Clicore.exe
   Slwnt32.exe
   Smsboot1.exe

If the client is mobile and logs in from a different time zone, these files are
recopied, causing a long delay on the dial-up connection (primarily caused by
the Clicore.exe file, which is approximately 3 MB in size).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
