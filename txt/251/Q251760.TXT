TITLE   :XADM: Exchange 5.5 Setup Doesn't Work on Windows 2000 (TS)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 on a Microsoft Windows
2000-based server (running Terminal Services in Application mode), Exchange
Server Setup doesn't work, and you receive the following error message:

   Processing file 'E:\SERVER\SETUP\(Platform)\server.ins', at or near line 205
   The directory name is invalid.
   Microsoft Windows NT
   ID no: 0xc002010b

   The directory name is invalid
   Microsoft Windows NT
   ID no: 0xc002010b

RESOLUTION
==========

Before you run Exchange Server 5.5 Setup, you must put Windows 2000 in Install
mode. To do so, install Exchange Server 5.5 by using the Windows 2000 Add/Remove
Software tool in Control Panel, or by typing the following at a command prompt
before you install Exchange Server 5.5 (or any application):

   "change user /install" (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, Terminal Server runs in Excecute mode. Excecute mode enables the
ability to map .ini files to the home directory. This allows multiple users to
run programs from the Terminal Server.

Use the change user /install command before you install an application to create
.ini files for the application in the Terminal Server system directory. These
files are used as master copies for the user-specific .ini files. After you
install the application, use the change user /execute command to revert to
normal .ini fil mapping. For additional information on the change command in
Terminal Server, click the article number below to view the article in the
