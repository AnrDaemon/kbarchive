   relaunch. See the Encarta 2001 Read Me for more assistance.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the following conditions are true:

 - The Microsoft Windows color palette setting is set to 16 colors.

   outdated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
