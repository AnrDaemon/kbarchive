======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL), versions 2.0, 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you assign BSTR to a CComVariant instance using
CComVariant::operator=(BSTR), any characters after an embedded NULL character in
BSTR are not copied.

CAUSE
=====

This is due to the implementation of CComVariant::operator=(BSTR) not accounting
for NULL characters inside BSTR being copied.

RESOLUTION
==========

Instead of using CComVariant::operator=(BSTR) to copy BSTR inside of
CComVariant, use the CComVariant::Copy() function and place BSTR inside of
VARIANT. The following code snippet could be used to replace
CComVariant::operator=(BSTR) if you need to make sure embedded NULL characters
and characters after embedded NULL characters are copied.

   void Function(BSTR bstrValue)
   {
     VARIANT v;
     v.vt = VT_BSTR;
     v.bstrVal = bstrValue;

     CComVariant a;
     a.Copy(&v); //Use this instead of the next line.
     //a = bstrValue; //This would not copy embedded NULLs or chars after NULL.

     //Use variant now to do whatever you need.
   }

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
