TITLE   :User Profile Folders Are Not Deleted After Logging Off
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition, when you enable the Delete Cached
Profile (DeleteRoamingCache) feature and a user logs off from the Terminal
Server, the profile is copied back to the central profile location and the
cached copy on the terminal server box is deleted.

In the process of deleting this cached copy, Terminal Server recursively removes
all the folders under the user's profile folder. But, the top level folder of
the user profile might not be removed.

This seems as if the Delete Cached Profile setting did not work, but the empty
folder does not cause any profile corruption.

Userenv log indicates error 32, a sharing violation occurred.

   1:USERENV: DeleteProfile: Delnode failed. Error = 32
   1:USERENV: UnloadUserProfile: DeleteProfileDirectory returned false (2).
   Error = 32

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the current directory for the Winlogon process running
under the user's context gets set to the user's profile folder incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
