TITLE   :XADM: Error Message: Account Information Is Bad
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While you are installing Exchange Server 5.5 on a Windows 2000-based member
server, you receive the following error message after you enter the service
account information:

   Account information is bad.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server service account does not have the required permissions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, add the Exchange Server service account to the local
Power Users group or local Administrators group on a member server. On a domain
controller, add the account to the built-in Administrators group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The minimum rights necessary for the Exchange Server service account on a member
server are Power Users rights. However, if installation problems occur when you
use the local Power Users group, add the Exchange Server service account to the
local Administrators group. Also, if the local Power Users group is not
available because of the type of installation that was performed, use the local
Administrators group.
