TITLE   :FIX: Suspend and Resume Thread Hangs Visual C++ Debugger

KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC600bug kbDSupport kbGrpDSVCCompiler kbVS600sp4fix kbVS600sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Integrated Debugger, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When debugging in the thread dialog box, suspend one of the threads and then
continue debugging. When the debugger stops on another breakpoint, resume the
suspend thread. As a result, the debugger stops responding, or hangs, and CPU
utilization may go to 100%.

CAUSE
=====

Under a debug build, every function call is prefixed with MOVESI, ESP (code
bytes: 8B F4) for the run-time check feature (/GZ). Thus, if you set a
breakpoint on any function call, the 8B is replaced with CC (INT 3) in memory to
generate a user-defined exception. Before execution continues, the debugger
replaces the CC with the original byte (in this case, 8B).

The debugger ignores the first user-defined exception (0x80000003) for the
breakpoint that was set. The byte after the 8B is F4. F4 is a HLT instruction
which is a privileged instruction; when this instruction executes, a privileged
instruction exception (0xC0000096) is generated. The debugger remains ignoring
exceptions, but unlike the user-defined exception, the instruction pointer isn't
advanced and when the debugger ignores this exception, the exception is
generated again thus entering an endless loop.

RESOLUTION
==========

One workaround is to use MsgBox() to simulate the suspend of thread.

A supported fix for Visual C++ 6.0 that corrects this problem is now available
from Microsoft, but it has not been fully regression tested and should be
applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.

Sample Code
-----------

   //   - Set a breakpoint on the printf() statement in ThreadMain().
   //   - Start debugging the program.
   //   - When the breakpoint is reached suspend the thread the breakpoint 
   //     occurred in.
   //   - Press F5. 
   //   - When the breakpoint is reached resume the previously suspended
   //     thread.
   //   - Press F5.
   //   - Note that the breakpoint in now not reached again and that CPU
   //     usage is 100%.
   // 
   // Required compiler switches: /GZ
   // 
   #include <windows.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <process.h>
   void ThreadMain(void *data)
   {
       for(int count=0; count<100; count++ )
       {
           printf("Thread id=%d,count=%d\n", (int)data, count );
           Sleep( 1000 );
       }
       _endthread();
   }

   void main(void)
   {
       HANDLE ThreadId[2];
       for (int i= 0; i < 2; i++)
       {
           Sleep(500);
           ThreadId[i]=(HANDLE)_beginthread(ThreadMain, 0, (void *) i);
       }
       WaitForMultipleObjects( 2, ThreadId, TRUE, INFINITE );
   }
