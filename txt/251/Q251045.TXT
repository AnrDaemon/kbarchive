======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, memory in shared code
sections of system global DLLs is shared across terminal server sessions.

On Windows 2000, however, memory in shared code sections of system global DLLs
cannot be shared across terminal server sessions. Instead, each session receives
its own instance of the variables that are declared within a shared code
section. That memory is shared among processes that are running within the same
session, but is not accessible to processes in other sessions.

CAUSE
=====

New architecture of Windows 2000 memory manager prevents shared code sections
from being shared across terminal server sessions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

If an application needs to share memory across terminal server sessions on
Windows 2000, it should do so through a global file mapping object.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows 2000 Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On computers that are running terminal server, you can register a DLL as a
system global resource. For additional information on how to perform this
registration, click the article number below to view the article in the
