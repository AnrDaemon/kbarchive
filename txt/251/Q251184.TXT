TITLE   :XADM: Link Monitor Doesn't Work After Priv.edb Is Renamed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

After you rename or delete a private information store (Priv.edb) within your
Exchsrvr\Mdbdata folder, you may notice that link monitors that were set up to
monitor that server no longer function properly. This happens if only the
information store was shut down to do this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When starting the Exchange Server services, the system attendant attempts to log
on to the information store to send and receive its own messages. If you stop
your information store, rename, or delete your Priv.edb file, and then start the
private information store by creating a new Priv.edb file, the system attendant
still thinks that it is logged on to the old private information store.

To get the link monitor messages working again, you need to stop and restart the
system attendant to log on to the new database that you created. When the next
polling interval occurs, the system attendant replies properly, and the link
monitor state indicates that the link is operational.
