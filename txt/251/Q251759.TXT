TITLE   :XADM: Exchange Server Mailbox Attributes Override Windows 2000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2000; winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After the replication process finishes in the Active Directory Connector (ADC),
the user attribute information from the Exchange Server 5.5 directory overrides
the user attribute information in the Active Directory when the Exchange Server
mailbox is associated to a Windows 2000 Advanced Server account.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because in the default matching rules (the Primary
Windows NT Account attribute corresponds to the Windows 2000 Advanced Server
"objectSID" attribute), the ADC always matches the Exchange Server mailbox with
the Windows NT account. The Exchange Server attributes are then considered to be
updates to the Windows NT account, and are changed to match the Exchange Server
mailbox.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced
Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs if the Connection Agreement is configured with the
"Replicate mailbox to NT user" or "Replicate mailbox to NT contacts" setting
selected.
