SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use Microsoft Paint to open a graphic file other than a bitmap
(.bmp) file, you may be unable to do so. However, you may be able to do so on a
different computer in Paint.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because Paint only provides support for bitmap files.
However, if you install a program that provides filters for other types of
graphic files (such as .gif or .jpg files), Paint can then provide support for
these file types.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue and use Paint for files other than bitmap files,
install a program that provides the appropriate graphics filter. For example,
Microsoft Word for Windows provides an assortment of filters you can install.
