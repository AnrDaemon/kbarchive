TITLE   :Guest Account Cannot be Used When Anonymous Access Is Disabled

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Web application on Internet Information Server (IIS) is configured to
allow Basic authentication and at the same time has Anonymous access disabled,
the built-in Guest user account cannot access the Web application. Also, if you
rename the built-in Guest user account to another name, the new name cannot be
used to access the Web application.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. If you disable Anonymous access to the Web site, the
SID of the default Guest user account is also refused access. Even if you rename
the built-in Guest user account, the SID is the same.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you want to use a user named Guest to access your Web site, follow these
steps:

1. Rename the original Guest user account to another name (for example
   "OldGuest").

2. Create a new user named "Guest" using the Copy function of the User Manager
   on the "OldGuest" account.

This new user will not have the limitation of the default Guest user account.
