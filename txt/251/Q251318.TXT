KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have two Exchange Server computers in two sites that are connected with
a site connector through a firewall as follows:

   Exchange Server in Site 1 <--> [firewall] <--> Exchange Server
   (on a Cluster Server) in Site 2

If the firewall between the sites opens only to the Cluster Server IP address, no
mail can be sent or received.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the message transfer agent (MTA) uses the active node IP
address instead of the Exchange Server Cluster Server group IP address to
initiate a connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
