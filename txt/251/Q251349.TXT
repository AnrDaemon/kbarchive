The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3

SYMPTOMS
========

When the SNA Server client is installed on a Terminal Server computer, the 3270
Applet may stop responding at a blank screen when it tries to connect to the
host. There are no errors logged in the event log on the SNA Server or on the
client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, run the appropriate Terminal Server compatibility
script for the type of SNA client you have installed (for example Windows 95,
Windows 98, or Windows NT). To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Stop SnaBase on the Terminal Server computer, and then open a command prompt.

2. Change to install mode by running the following command:

   change user /install

3. Run the compatibility script for the type of SNA client that is installed.

   For SNA 4.0SP3

   The following SNA client scripts for Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server are
   located on the SNA Server 4.0 SP3 compact disc in the Trmsrv\Nt40 folder:

   Snantcli.cmd
   Sna9xcli.cmd (only needs to be run if the Terminal Server file system is NTFS)

   The following Windows 2000 SNA client script is available on the SNA Server
   4.0 SP3 CD in the Trmsrv\W2k folder:

   Snantcli.cmd

   For SNA Server 4.0 SP2

   For SNA Server 4.0 SP2, the compatibility scripts are located in the Trmsrv
   folder. The following SNA client scripts are available:

   SNA4sp2c.cmd (Windows NT client)
   SNA4sp29.cmd (Windows 95/Windows 98 client. You do not need to run this if the
   Terminal Server file system is FAT.)

   For SNA Server 3.0 SP3 and later

   For SNA Server 3.0, the compatibility scripts are located in the
   Wtsrv\Application Compatibility Scripts folder. The following SNA client
   compatibility script is available:

   Mssna30.cmd (SNA Server or Client version 3.0)

4. Change back to execute mode by running the following command:

   change user /execute

Note: The Terminal Server compatibility scripts for SNA Server were not included
with versions prior to the ones listed above.
