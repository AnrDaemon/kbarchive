TITLE   :XADM: Move Server Wizard Stops After Information Store Fix
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbgraphxlinkcritical

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the Exchange Server Move Server Wizard on an Exchange Server version
5.5 Service Pack 3 computer to which a Store.exe fix version 5.5.2651.32 or
later has been applied, the following error message may be displayed when the
wizard tries to upgrade the private information store database:

   Microsoft Exchange Move Server Wizard
   An unexpected error has occurred while updating the Microsoft Exchange
   Private Information Store
   ID no: c1070451
   <OK>

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if you upgrade the database by using a Store.exe
program version 5.5.2651.32 or later. Earlier versions of the Move Server Wizard
cannot process the extra data in the information store.

If the Store.exe program is version 5.5.2651.32 or later, and the Mvstore.dll
file is not version 5.5.2651.73 or later, the Move Server Wizard stops
responding.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the error message in the "Symptoms" section of this article is displayed, you
must install the latest information store fix after you restore the system from
a tape backup and before you run the Move Server Wizard again.

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Move Server Wizard

+---------------------------+
| File name   | Version     | 
+---------------------------+
| Mvstore.dll | 5.5.2651.73 |

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3.

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. After it is posted, the file is housed on
secure servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

NOTE: When you start this version of the information store, the information store
databases are automatically upgraded to a new format. After you upgrade the
databases, you can restore an earlier version of the Store.exe file on the
server, but only if it is version 5.5.2651.32 or later. If you restore a
Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2651.32 after you upgrade the database,
you are no longer able to start the information store. For additional
