TITLE   :Problems Installing Proxy Server 2.0 Update in Windows 2000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2000; winnt:4.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.5 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

For Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0 to function properly on a Windows 2000-based
server, you must update it by using the Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.5
Readiness Kit for Windows 2000. When you install this update, Setup stops and
later restarts the World Wide Web Publishing (WWW) service. Setup may seem to
stop responding (hang) while it is stopping and restarting the WWW service,
while displaying either of following messages:

   Setup is stopping the WWW services

   -or-

   Setup is starting the WWW services

RESOLUTION
==========

The Setup program is not actually hung; the services do eventually stop and
restart. There are two options:

 - Wait for the WWW service to stop and start. This may take a long time.

 - Manually stop and start the WWW service. Click Start, point to Programs,
   point to Administrative Tools, and then click Services. When Setup is
   attempting to stop the WWW service, manually stop the World Wide Web
   Publishing service. After the update is complete and Setup is attempting to
   restart the WWW service, manually restart the World Wide Web Publishing
   service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with installing BackOffice Server
4.5 in Windows 2000.
