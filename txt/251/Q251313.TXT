SUMMARY
=======

This article provides step-by-step instructions for configuring SNA Server for
PU Passthrough connections. An SNA node can access a host through the
connections available on a computer running SNA Server using the PU Passthrough
Service. This service causes SNA Server to work like an IBM 3174 cluster
controller, allowing display, printer, and LU6.2 sessions from the downstream
device. The downstream node does not have to be an SNA Server. PU Passthrough is
useful when a downstream device cannot connect directly to the mainframe or
AS/400 computer.

================

Configuring SNA Server for PU Passthrough Connections

1. On the SNA Server computer, configure two connections. The connection to the
   host can be any supported host connection type, including SDLC and channel
   adapters. The downstream connection must be an Ethernet or Token Ring
   connection. For this example, "connection A" will refer to the host
   connection and "connection B" will refer to the downstream connection.

2. Specify the MACADDR of the host as the Remote Network Address on connection
   A, and then specify the MACADDR of the downstream device as the Remote
   Network Address on connection B.

3. Select PU Passthrough as the remote end for both connections. The allowed
   direction and activation fields cannot be changed.

4. In the properties of one connection, select the other connection for
   Passthrough via Connection. This will notify SNA Server that data arriving on
   one connection should be passed to the other connection.

5. Before you configure the downstream SNA node, you may want to change the
   Remote End of connection A (connection to the host) to Host System, and then
   verify that the connection will activate successfully. Before you configure
   the downstream node, change the connection back to PU Passthrough.

6. On the downstream SNA device, the connection type is either Token Ring or
   Ethernet. The Remote Network Address for this connection should be the
   address of the SNA Server handling the PU Passthrough. You can obtain this
   address by typing ipconfig /all at a command prompt on the SNA Server
   computer. All LUs should be configured on the downstream node. This includes
   LU6.2 sessions, display, and printer sessions. Refer to the SNA Server online
   documentation for additional information about configuring display, printer,
   and LU6.2 sessions.

Note: If the host connection is to an AS/400 computer, you need to delete any
existing controller descriptions for the SNA Server computer handling PU
Passthrough. If the AS/400 Autocreate feature is enabled, a new controller
description should be created on the AS/400 computer when the downstream device
connects to the AS/400 computer for the first time. This new controller will
have the name of the downstream device and the MACADDR of the SNA Server.

Troubleshooting hint: Because the SNA Server computer may have other host DLC
connections defined, you may need to adjust the Service Access Point (SAP)
addresses before this will work properly. This is required when two or more
connections communicate with the same host destination. For additional
