SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install the GroupWise Proxy Generator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In a multiple-site environment, to send and receive mail with the
GroupWise-connected computers, you must separately install the GroupWise Proxy
Generator on sites other than the site where the Microsoft Exchange Connector
for Novell GroupWise is installed. If the GroupWise Proxy Generator is not
installed, the mailboxes in the other sites do not have an e-mail addressspace
for GroupWise.

The GroupWise Connector includes the Proxy Generator feature that generates
GroupWise e-mail addresses for Exchange Server accounts. Exchange Server
accounts with GroupWise e-mail addresses are added to the GroupWise folder when
you perform folder synchronization. Exchange Server accounts that are located at
other sites where the GroupWise Connector is not installed must be given
GroupWise e-mail addresses by a GroupWise Proxy Generator that is installed at
that site.

To install the GroupWise Proxy Generator at a site other than the site where the
GroupWise Connector is installed, run Setup for the GroupWise Connector, and
then click "Only Install Proxy Generator".

After you install the GroupWise Proxy Generator, check for the presence of the
Gwxpxgen.dll file to verify that Proxy Generator was successfully installed. If
you originally installed of Exchange Server 5.5 to the C drive, the path to the
file is:

   C:\Exchsrvr\Address\GWISE\I386\Gwxpxgen.dll

Additional query words: gwxpxgen.dll; gwise; directory synchronization
