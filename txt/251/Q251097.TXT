-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to Exchange Server by using Post Office Protocol 3
(POP3) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) over Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL), the following event is logged in the application event log of the
Exchange Server computer:

   Event Type: Error
   Event Source: MSExchange <Protocol> Interface
   Event Category: Authentication
   Event ID: 13002
   Description:
   An attempt to connect an SSL client failed because the server does not have a
   valid certificate.

If you are using Microsoft Outlook Express as a client, you may receive the
following error message:

   Your server has unexpectedly terminated the connection. Possible causes for
   this include server problems, network problems, or a long period of
   inactivity. Account: 'Server', Server: 'Server', Protocol: POP3, Port: 995,
   Secure(SSL): Yes, Error Number: 0x800CCC0F

CAUSE
=====

The SSL certificate is not installed on the protocol that you are using, or the
certificate is improperly installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, make sure that the certificate has been installed
correctly. For additional information about how to install the certificate
correctly, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q175439 XFOR: Enabling SSL For Exchange Server

If you are using the version of Key Manager that is installed with the Microsoft
Windows NT version 4.0 Option Pack or the Microsoft Internet Information
Services (IIS) in Exchange Server 4.0 or later, make sure that that the key is
installed for the default IP address, or the specific IP address of the server:

1. In Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for IIS, click Key Manager to start Key
   Manager.

2. If the word "Default" is not displayed next to the keys for each protocol,
   you need to add it:

   a. Double-click each key to open the IP bindings.

   b. Click Default for all of the unspecified IP addresses.

After you perform these steps for the Exchange Server SMTP protocol, you must
restart the Exchange Server Internet Mail Service.
