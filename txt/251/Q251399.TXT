TITLE   :Visual FoxPro FoxRun.pif Fails with Long File Names in NT/W2K
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to use the !/Run command in Visual FoxPro on a Windows NT or Windows
2000 computer and the files are in Long File Name format, the execution fails
with the following error:

   To many parameters - Files

This also occurs if a batch file contains a Long File Name.

CAUSE
=====

The FoxRun.pif file points to the wrong file. FoxRun.pif points to Command.com
on NT or Windows 2000. Command.com is not a DOS 7+ version but rather a DOS 6
version, which produces errors with Long File Names. FoxRun.pif should point to
the CMD.exe file.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Use the Windows Explorer to navigate to the FoxRun.pif file located in the
   Visual FoxPro home directory.

2. Right-click and choose Properties.

3. Select the Program tab.

4. Change the Cmd line from:

Command.com

to:

CMD.exe

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a batch file, such as d:\test.bat.

2. Add the following line to the batch file:

   cd "d:\Program Files"

3. You may replace the preceding directory with any valid Long File Name path.

4. Type the following in the FoxPro Command window:

"RUN d:\test.bat" (without the quotation marks)

When you try to run the batch file from Visual FoxPro, you receive the following
error message because Command.com does not understand the long file name
d:\Program Files:

   To many parameters - Files
