TITLE   :OLE Automation Number Conversion Changed in SP4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5,4.0 SP6,4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

There may be conflicting symbols for decimal separators and digit grouping for
numbers and currencies in a user's regional settings. For example:

                   Numbers        Currency
   ---------------------------------------
   Decimal         ,              .
   Grouping        .              ,

Prior to Service Pack 4, programs can convert strings to numbers correctly in
this situation. With Service Pack 4 or later, numbers are truncated after the
first symbol in the string. Or, there may be other effects resulting in
incorrect conversion of user input.

CAUSE
=====

The conversion algorithm was changed so that it honors both number types. When
the settings conflict, incorrect results occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

Programs can check for conflicting settings by calling the Win32 GetLocaleInfo
function by using these values for the LCType parameter:

                   Numbers           Currency
   --------------------------------------------------------
   Decimal         LOCALE_SDECIMAL   LOCALE_SMONDECIMALSEP
   Grouping        LOCALE_STHOUSAND  LOCALE_SMONTHOUSANDSEP

If conflicting settings are detected, the program can prompt the user to resolve
the mismatch.
