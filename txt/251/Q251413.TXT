The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may need to export the schema from an Exchange Server computer. The default
schema is in the Schema.csv file on the Exchange Server distribution CD-ROM, but
in some cases you may want to export the current schema for your site. For
example, you may want to compare an old schema export to a new schema export to
see the effects of a service pack update on the schema.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To export the schema, perform the following steps:

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin
/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by
   typing the following at a command prompt:

   "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r" (without the quotation marks)

2. On the View menu, click Raw Directory.

3. In the left pane, click the Schema object. Wait for the schema to appear in
   right pane.

4. Click any item in the right pane.

5. On the File menu, click Save Window Contents. Type a name for the file, and
   then click OK.

This exports the schema to a .csv file that contains two columns, the Display
Name column and the Modified column.
