SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 (SP6), some cluster
disks may not come online. If the quorum disk is affected, the entire cluster
does not start. The problem is most likely to occur after you "cold boot" the
computer. If cluster logging is enabled, you may see an entry similar to the
following example:

   Physical Disk <Disk X:> : SCSI, error reserving disk, error 21.

CAUSE
=====

The partition table on the disk contains an invalid entry that is misinterpreted
by the cluster disk driver.
