KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.5 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Installing BackOffice 4.5 in Windows 2000 requires that you follow specific
steps to complete the installation properly. One of these steps is to install
Microsoft Site Server 3.0 and Site Server 3.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) before you
install the BackOffice 4.5 Server programs.

When the installation of Site Server 3.0 SP2 is complete, the following dialog
boxes appear:

   Site Server 3.0 Service Pack 2

   Site Server 3.0 has been updated.
   Remove any disks from the floppy disk drives
   and choose OK to reboot your computer.

   If you add any additional Site Server Components,
   you will need to reapply the Service Pack.

   -and-

   Windows File Protection

   Files that are required for Windows to run properly have been
   replaced by unrecognized versions. To maintain system stability,
   Windows must restore the original versions of these files.

   Insert your Windows 2000 Server CD-ROM now.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To protect the integrity of the operating system, Windows 2000 displays the
Windows File Protection dialog box. BackOffice 4.5 installs properly on Windows
2000 Server, even if Windows File Protection replaces changed files. When the
Windows File Protection dialog box appears, insert the Windows 2000 Server
CD-ROM, and then click Retry. When you click Retry, the changed system files are
restored to their original state, and the system can then be rebooted.

After the computer restarts, continue the installation as described in the
"Installing Microsoft BackOffice 4.5 on Windows 2000 Server" white paper. You
