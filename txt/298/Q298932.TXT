======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install SMS Web Reports, you may receive the following error
message:

   Connection test failed! Please verify you have entered the connection
   information correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS Web Reports require the use of standard security for the connection to
the SQL server. This error can occur if standard security is not enabled on the
SQL server. The following requirements must be met so you can install SMS Web
Reports:

 - Installation requires Mixed or Standard SQL Security mode, and will not work
   with Integrated Security mode.

 - When you install the SMS Web Reporting tool, you must type the password for
   the SA user account on the SQL server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install SMS Web Reports, Setup must be able to grant READ access to the
SQL view objects. This requires the use of the SA account to obtain DBO rights
to the SQL view objects.
