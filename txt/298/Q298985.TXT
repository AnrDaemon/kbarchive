SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to create a route by using one of the programs listed at the
beginning of this article, you may receive an error message similar to the
following

   Unable to get directions from <location> to <location>. One of
   the areas may not contain necessary connectors such as ferry routes or main
   roads. Move one or both of the stops, and try again.

where the locations listed are part of the route that you are attempting to
create.

You may also receive this error message when you use the Avoid Area command to
create an alternate route.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you attempt to create a route through an area for
which the program does not contain street or highway information.

For example, if you attempt to create a route through a national park, a military
base, or any area where travel is restricted, the street and highway information
may not be available to plot through those areas. As a result, the program plots
an alternate route around the area in question.

This behavior is by design. When no data point information is available for the
routing program for a selected route, the program plots the trip by an alternate
route, where possible. If the program is unable to plot an alternate route, you
receive the error message described in the "Symptoms" section of this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, plot two separate routes, as follows:

1. Plot the first route from your start point to the place at which the data
   becomes unavailable.

2. Plot a second route starting from the place at which the data is available
   again, and onward to your final destination.
