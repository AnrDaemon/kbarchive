SUMMARY
=======

The COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) feature in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000 is supported when you use IMS Connect as the TCP/IP communications
package on an IBM OS/390 system.

IMS Connect is a facility for Information Management Systems (IMS) that provides
TCP/IP access to IMS applications running on an IBM OS/390 system. As of March
1st, 2001, IBM has officially discontinued support for the IMS TCP/IP OTMA
Connection (IMS TOC). IMS Connect replaces the OTMA Connection product and is
available as a separately priced facility for IMS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure COMTI to communicate with an IMS system through IMS Connect, both
the COMTI type library (.tlb) and the COMTI Remote Environment (RE) should
specify the IMS using OTMA Remote Environment type.

For more information on IMS and IMS Connect, see the following IBM Web site:
