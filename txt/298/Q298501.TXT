The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT, versions (all versions and editions), 4.0 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer that is running Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0, if you change the
caption of a menu item that has a shortcut key in the parent menu click event,
the new caption is displayed incorrectly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you change the menu item caption from any other event, or if you change it in
the parent menu click event while you are running on another operating system,
the changed caption is displayed correctly.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On a Windows 95-based or a Windows NT 4.0-based system, create a new Standard
   EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Select Form1. From the Tools menu, click Menu Editor, or click the Menu
   Editor button on the toolbar.

3. In the Caption text box, type "Edit" (without the quotation marks). This is
   the parent item that appears on the menu bar.

4. In the Name text box, type "mnuEdit" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click Next to create another menu item.

5. In the Caption text box, type "Copy" (without the quotation marks).

6. In the Name text box, type "mnuCopy" (without the quotation marks).

7. In the Shortcut combo box, click the CTRL+C key combination.

8. Click the right arrow button to change the indentation level of the item, and
   then click OK to close the Menu Editor dialog box.

9. Paste the following code in the general declarations section of Form1:

   Private Sub mnuEdit_Click()
       mnuCopy.Caption = "Paste"
   End Sub

10. Press F5 to run the project, and then click the Edit menu. Notice that the
   caption of the child menu item is not displayed correctly.
