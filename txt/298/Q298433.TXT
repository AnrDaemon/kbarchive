TITLE   :SMS: Clients in Shared Subnet Don't Inst. in Multiple SMS Sites
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbClient kbConfig kbServer kbsms200 kbDiscovery kbUpgrade

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Clients that are in a subnet that is listed in the site boundaries of multiple
Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 sites may not be listed as "installed into
all sites" if the following conditions are met:

 - Remote installation is enabled.

 - Logon installation is disabled.

CAUSE
=====

When remote installation creates a client configuration request (CCR) to
remotely install a client, remote installation first checks the client for the
existence of the SMS client service. This issue can occur if this service is
found; the remote client installation stops, even though remote installation may
be installing from a different site.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, enable logon installation in all of the domains from
which clients log on. A client that is using logon installation checks all known
sites for membership by evaluating the site boundary lists that logon points
contain, and installs into all eligible sites.
