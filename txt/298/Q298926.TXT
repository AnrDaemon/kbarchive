TITLE   :PRB: Error 800a01ad When You Run a WebClass from Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbServer kbVBp kbWebClasses kbGrpDSASP kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a WebClass in debug mode in the Visual Basic Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) through a Terminal Server client, you may receive the
following error message:

   MS VBscript runtime error
   ActiveX component can't create object 0X800a01ad
   Webclass1.asp line 14

CAUSE
=====

The associated WebClass dynamic-link library (DLL) file does not have sufficient
permissions when it is running through a Terminal Server session.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, physically run the WebClass on the server one time for
it to work from Terminal Server client.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The information in this article applies to all versions of Windows 2000 except
Windows 2000 Professional, which does not support running Terminal Services.

When you log on to Windows 2000, you start a session on the server (for example,
User-0 for example). When you log on through a Terminal Server client, you start
another session (for example, User-1). Windows 2000 must differentiate between
these two sessions. Even though you may be logged on under the same user name
(User), these two sessions are running under two separate security contexts
(User-0 and User-1). When you run the WebClass and its associated DLL on the
server, they run under the User-0 context. When you run the WebClass and its
associated DLL through Terminal Server, they run under the User-1 context.

When you run the DLL directly on the server first, the DLL is compiled and loaded
into Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) under the correct User security
context. As a result, any attempt to run through Terminal Server afterwards
appears successful. However, if changes are made from the client, the DLL must
be recompiled (physically run on the server again).

NOTE: This error is specific to running a Visual Basic WebClass through Terminal
Server. However, you may encounter other errors when you run any Visual Basic
component under a service.
