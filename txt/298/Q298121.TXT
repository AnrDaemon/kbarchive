MORE INFORMATION
================

To install MSN Explorer and upgrade to MSN Internet Access service from free
hotmail.com or msn.com accounts

1. Start MSN Explorer, and then click Continue.

2. Click Yes, I would like to sign up for MSN Internet Access but keep my
   existing e-mail address, and then click Continue. The Dialing options screen
   appears.

3. Select one or more of the following, as appropriate:
    - I need to dial a number to reach an outside line.

    - I need to dial a code to disable call waiting.

    - I do not have touch tone service.

4. Click Continue.
   MSN Explorer will now dial and connect to a 1-800 number.

5. Type the e-mail name and password for the account you want to upgrade,
   specify whether the account is a hotmail.com account or a msn.com account,
   and then click Continue.

6. Type the e-mail name and password for the account you want to upgrade,
   specify whether the account is a hotmail.com account or a msn.com account,
   and then click Continue.

   A list of all access numbers in your area appears.

12. Specify whether MSN Explorer should dial a "1" or the area code by selecting
   dialing properties as appropriate.
   Note: If you do not see a local access number in this list, try changing the
   Area Code and Phone Number fields at the top of the page to approximate a
   known local access number (with the same area code and prefix), and then
   click Continue. This will refresh the list of access numbers in the list.

13. Click Continue after you select the correct access numbers.

14. Click I Accept, and then click Continue.

15. Type your credit card information, and then click Continue.

16. Click I Accept, and then click Continue.

   MSN Explorer will now dial one of the local access numbers selected and sign
   you in. The first screen you will see after signing in invites you to take
   the tour.

If you already have a free Hotmail.com or msn.com user tile set up in MSN
Explorer 6.1, you can also upgrade these types of accounts to paid MSN Internet
Access accounts.
Note: You can only use this feature if you do not already have a paying MSN
Internet Access subscriber user tile set up on the computer. You also must have
a modem installed on the computer to complete the upgrade. Follow these steps to
upgrade the account.

To upgrade to MSN Internet Access service from free hotmail.com or msn.com
accounts

2. In the upper-right corner, click Help And Settings.
