SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up and configure Microsoft FrontPage 2000
Server Extensions to work with Internet Information Server (IIS) version 5.0.

Install the FrontPage Server Extensions for Windows
---------------------------------------------------

FrontPage Server Extensions are installed and configured by default. However, if
the user has removed FrontPage Server Extensions or chose not to install them
when Windows was installed, follow these steps to install and configure them:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

2. In Add/Remove Programs, click Add/Remove Windows Components.

3. In the Components box of the Windows Components Wizard, click Internet
   Information Services (IIS), and then click Details.

   NOTE: Do not clear Internet Information Services (IIS). This will uninstall
   IIS components.

4. Under Subcomponents of Internet Information Services, select FrontPage 2000
   Server Extensions, and then click OK.

5. In the Windows Components Wizard, click Next.

6. When the Windows Components Wizard completes the installation, click Finish.

If you are installing to a computer with a single Web server, the FrontPage
Server Extensions are installed in the content area of the Web server
automatically. If the server is IIS, the initial administrator's account is your
system administrator account.

Enable FrontPage Server Extensions on the System
------------------------------------------------

1. On the Start menu, click Run, type "MMC" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click OK.

2. On the Console menu, click Add/Remove Snap-in.

   NOTE: If the Console menu shows only Options, click Options and change Console
   mode to Author mode, then click Add/Remove Snap-in on the Console menu.

3. On the Standalone tab, click Add.

4. Select Internet Information Services from the list and click Add, then close
   the Add Standalone Snap-in dialog box.

5. On the Standalone tab, select Internet Information Services and click the
   Extensions tab.

6. Ensure that FrontPage Server Extensions is selected in the Available
   extensions list and click OK.

7. Close the console and name it IISConsole (or another name that you can
   remember).

Enable FrontPage Server Extensions on a Web Site
------------------------------------------------

Even though the necessary software to support FrontPage is preinstalled, you must
enable these extensions on the specific Web sites that your FrontPage content
developers will be using.

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
   Internet Services Manager.

   NOTE: In Administrative Tools, the IIS console is called Internet Services
   Manager; however, when you open the console, it is called Internet
   Information Services, also known as the IIS snap-in.

2. Under Internet Information Service, expand your server (where server_name is
   the name of your server).

3. Right-click the Web site node in the Internet Services Manager console tree,
   point to All Tasks, and select Configure Server Extensions.

4. Start the Server Extensions Configuration Wizard.

   NOTE: The wizard cannot create a new Web site; it can only configure a Web
   site for FrontPage users.

5. Click Next to create local Windows groups. Identify users as FrontPage
   administrators, authors, or browsers for the selected Web site. These three
   groups can be described as follows:

    - Administrators: Members of this group can create new FrontPage Web sites,
      change settings on the Web site, control the site authoring process,
      author new content, and browse existing content in the site.

    - Authors: Members of this group can author new content and browse existing
      content in the site.

    - Browsers: Members of this group can browse existing content in the site,
      but cannot modify folders and files on this server.

6. Click Next to specify a Windows group or user account that will be the Web
   administrator for the selected site.

7. Click Next to specify Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) e-mail settings
   for the site (if necessary).

8. Click Finish to enable and configure FrontPage Server Extensions on the site.

9. Click the Action button on the Internet Information Services toolbar.

10. Select Refresh from the drop-down menu to refresh the window view. The
   selected Web site should be populated with a whole series of virtual and
   physical subdirectories with their associated server extension files.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you delete any of these FrontPage files or directories, the server extensions
may not work properly.
