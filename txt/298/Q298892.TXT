TITLE   :SNA/HIS Client Logon Fails After New Password Prompt
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport sna4 kbhis2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a user's Windows NT or Windows 2000 domain password expires, the Windows 9x
Client for SNA Server 4.0 will display a "Logon Failed" message when a session
is initiated after the user changes the password. The Host Integration Server
(HIS) 2000 End User Client will display an "Error: Could not open sponsor
connection" message after the password is changed.

After the Windows NT or Windows 2000 password is successfully changed, the user
is able to connect to the SNA Server or HIS 2000 server if the SNA Server or HIS
client application is restarted.

CAUSE
=====

SnaBase was not able to successfully perform a new logon attempt after the
user's domain password was changed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server 4.0 and
Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Use Windows Domain Password option is not selected in the SNA Server
Windows 9x or HIS 2000 End User client, a domain logon information pop-up dialog
box is presented when the client connection is initiated. If the user's domain
account has been set for "user must change password at next logon" or the
account password has expired, a password change dialog box will be presented.
