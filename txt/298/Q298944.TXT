======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to Exchange Server by using Outlook Express or
another Post Office Protocol (POP3) client, you may receive the following error
message:

   There was a problem logging onto your mail server. Your Password was
   rejected. Account: '<alias> on <Server>', Server:
   '<server>', Protocol: POP3, Server Response: '-ERR Logon failure:
   unknown user name or bad password.', Port 110, Secure(SSL): No, Server Error:
   0x800CCC90, Error Number: 0x800CCC92

   Event Category: General
   Event ID: 1194
   Description:
   Accept clients on external interface POP3 failed with error 0x80004005.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can be caused by third-party antivirus software services that are
currently active.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, stop or turn off all antivirus services that are
currently active on the system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In some cases, simply turning off the antivirus software does not resolve this
issue. You may need to completely remove the antivirus software, restart the
computer, and then reinstall the antivirus software.

The antivirus program may be taking ownership of the POP3 port so that when
Exchange Server attempts to gain access to the port, the port is already in use
by the antivirus program. Some antivirus programs have an option that you can
deselect to keep the antivirus program from taking control of the POP3 port, so
that POP3 mail can be downloaded.

The computer may also display a Dr. Watson error message in PoProxy.exe when
Exchange Server starts. This issue can occur if Norton AntiVirus is installed on
the computer and the Norton e-mail protection program process, PoProxy.exe, is
running. PoProxy.exe is a client component. If PoProxy.exe is installed on an
Exchange Server computer, you must completely remove it. Simply disabling
PoProxy.exe does not resolve the issue.
