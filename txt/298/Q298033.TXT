KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbConfig kbDatabase _IK964 kbServer kbsms200 kbHelpDesk kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have appropriate Systems Management Server (SMS) security rights and
try to remotely control an SMS client, you may be unable to do so. The following
error message may be generated:

   Remote Tools
   Security rights to run remote tools on this client have been denied.

Note that this issue may also occur when you run the Remote.exe command from a
command prompt.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the SMS database is located on a Microsoft SQL Server
2000 computer on which the database is configured to use
SQL_SwedishStd_Pref_CP1_CI_AS collation. Unless this configuration is specified
manually, either on database or server level, this issue occurs when you upgrade
the database server from SQL Server 7.0 configured with ISO character set (ID=1)
and Swedish/Finnish (Std) dict order, case insensitive, uppercase pref sort
order (ID=185). To determine whether this is the configured database collation,
right-click the SMS database in SQL Server Enterprise Manager, and then click
Properties. You can view the configured collation under Collation Name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not recommend or support the use of this collation in conjunction
with SMS. If you are already running this database configuration, you may want
to contact Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) for assistance transferring
the data in the SMS database to a server that is running a different collation.
