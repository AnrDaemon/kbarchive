Chapter 12: Sweet Forgiveness Sample Site Not Available
-------------------------------------------------------

Throughout Chapter 12, "Developing an International Site", there are several
references to the Microsoft Commerce Server 2000 sample site named Sweet
Forgiveness. On page 335 of the book, the second paragraph indicates that the
sample site is located on the Commerce Server 2000 Resource Kit CD. The online
book refers to the same site being available at
http://www.microsoft.com/commerceserver/default.asp.

The site is not available at this time in either location.

Microsoft Press has confirmed this to be a problem in the Commerce Server 2000
Resource Kit. We are researching this problem and will post new information as
soon as it becomes available.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
