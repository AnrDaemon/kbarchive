TITLE   :"Stop 0x0000000A" Err Msg When You Use Nwfs.sys Redirector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP6
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the IntranetWare Client Redirector for Windows NT (the Nwfs.sys
file) by Novell Netware that is dated before May 2001, you may receive the
following error message on a blue screen:

   Stop 0x0000000A (0x0003aa0c, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0xf7026aea)

NOTE: The contents of the error message may vary.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the user memory is not locked before it is
passed to both the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) driver and the local area
network (LAN) driver. Most of the time the IntranetWare Client Redirector for
Windows NT works because the memory is not paged out.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, contact Novell for an updated Nwfs.sys driver.
