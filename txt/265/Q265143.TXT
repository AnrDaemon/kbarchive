TITLE   :.nim File for NetWare Servers Reports "No Data Available"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a custom NOIDMIF file to report on a Novell NetWare server, the
attribute data is displayed as "No Data Available" in the Systems Management
Server (SMS) Administrator console.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS Maintenance Manager thread of the SMS Executive component is responsible
for the inventory of NetWare file servers. Maintenance Manager creates an IDMIF
file for hardware and software inventory and a separate IDMIF file that contains
any NOIDMIF data from any submitted .nim files.

The IDMIF file that contains .nim file data is submitted to the inventory
processor first, followed shortly by the inventory MIF file. The NOIDMIF (.nim)
file attributes are then displayed as "No Data Available" in the SMS
Administrator console.

RESOLUTION
==========

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, follow these steps on the SMS site server:

1. Stop all SMS 1.2 site services on the site server.

2. Replace the Maintain.dll file that is located in the
   SMS\Site.srv\<Platform>.Bin folder with the copy that is supplied in
   the hotfix.

3. Restart the SMS site services.

After you apply this hotfix, Maintenance Manager performs a hardware and software
inventory of Novell NetWare servers and appends .nim file data for all .nim
files that are found in the Logon.srv\Isvmif.box folder on the NetWare server to
the inventory MIF file. A single MIF file is produced.

For information about collecting NOIDMIF files, see page 114 in the SMS 1.2
Resource Guide.
