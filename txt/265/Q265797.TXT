SUMMARY
=======

User-defined data types (UDTs) are not supported in eMbedded Visual Basic (eVB).
The only data type provided by eVB is a Variant, which do not explicitly support
user-defined data types.

Calling Windows CE APIs that use structures is also not supported from eMbedded
Visual Basic. Although it is possible to use structures, Microsoft recommends
that you avoid using Declare statements that include structures.
