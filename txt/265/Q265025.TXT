SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive an "Access violation" error message in Ntbackup.exe just as
Backup is about to start backing up files.


CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the tape is not yet ready (for example, when it is
still being rewound) when Backup tries to check the tape for a password. This
problem is most likely to occur if you try to start a new backup immediately
after a previous backup session finishes.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.
