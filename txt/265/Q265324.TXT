   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to mount an NFS shared directory on a Linux server from a Services
for UNIX (SFU) 2.0 client, the Linux server displays the following error
message:

   svc: unknown version (3)

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Linux only supports NFS version 2.0. By default,
SFU attempts to connect by using NFS version 3.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To disable NFS version 3.0 support in SFU, use the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Client for NFS\CurrentVersion\Default

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

   Value Name: DisableV3
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: 1

4. Quit Registry Editor.
