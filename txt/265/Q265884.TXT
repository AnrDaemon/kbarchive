SYMPTOMS
========

If you declare an optional parameter of type Variant with the default value set
to Null in your ActiveX Component Project (such as ActiveX DLL, ActiveX control
(OCX), or ActiveX EXE), you receive the following error message (458) when you
compile the project:

   Variable uses an Automation Type not supported in Visual Basic

Visual Basic does not give you any details on which line of code causes the
error.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is to replace Null with the predefined constant vbNull.

STATUS

beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new ActiveX DLL project in Visual Basic 6.0. Class1 is added by
   default.

2. Paste the following code into the code window of Class1:

   Option Explicit

   Public Sub Method1(Optional ByVal x As Variant = Null)
   '
   End Sub

3. On the File menu, select Save Project.

4. On the File menu, select Make Project1.dll, and note that you receive the
   previous error message immediately.

5. Change Null to vbNull in the preceding code, repeat steps 3 and 4, and note
   that the project compiles without error.
