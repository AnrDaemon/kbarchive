TITLE   :SMS 1.2 Remote Control Agent May Not Start with NIC Teaming
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbClient _IK964 kbHelpDesk kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server (SMS) 1.2 Remote Control Agent service
(Wuser32.exe) may not start on Microsoft Windows NT-based clients and may
generate the following error messages if the Compaq NIC Teaming feature is
enabled:

   Remote Control Agent: Failed to initialize the network.

   Could not start the SMS Remote Control Agent service on \\<Servername>
   Error 2186: The service is not responding to the control function.

   Could not start the SMS Remote Control Agent service on \\<Servername>
   Error 2140: An internal Windows NT error occurred.

   Event ID 7022: SMS Remote Control Server Agent hung on starting

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if LANA number 000 on the NetBIOS interface is bound to
one of the network adapters that is included in the NIC team (instead of being
bound to the NIC teaming software).

WORKAROUND
==========

LANA number 000 on the NetBIOS interface must be bound to the teaming software,
not to an individual network adapter.

The NetBIOS configuration for Windows NT 4.0 should be similar to the following
sample configuration:

   LANA number   Network route
   ----------------------------------------
   000           NetBT -> CPQANC -> CPQANC3
   001           NetBT -> N100 -> N1001
   002           NetBT -> N100 -> N1002

Note that the teaming software is bound to LANA 000.

To view or modify this configuration, right-click Network Neighborhood on the
desktop, click Properties, click the Services tab, click NetBIOS Interface, and
then click Properties.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

This problem does not occur in Systems Management Server version 2.0.
