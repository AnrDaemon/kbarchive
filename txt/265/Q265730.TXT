TITLE   :XCLN: Cannot Install OWA From an Exchange Server 5.5 Upgrade CD
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Outlook Web Access (OWA) from an Exchange Server 5.5
Upgrade CD on a computer running Internet Information Service (IIS) but with no
existing Exchange Server 5.5 components, Setup may stop.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server 5.5 Upgrade CD upgrades only components that are already
installed. Since no prior Exchange Server components exist on a new IIS server,
Setup has nothing to upgrade.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, on the IIS computer, use an Exchange Server CD of an
earlier version to install an Exchange component, and then install the OWA
component.

Follow these steps:

1. On the computer running IIS, run an Exchange Server 4.x or 5.O CD, and in the
   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup dialog box, click Complete/Custom.

2. In the Exchange Server Setup Complete/Custom dialog box, click to select
   Books Online in the Options box.

3. Restart the computer.

4. Run the Exchange Server 5.5 Upgrade CD, and in the Microsoft Exchange Server
   Setup dialog box, click Complete/Custom.

5. In the Exchange Server Setup Complete/Custom dialog box, click to select
   Books Online in the Options box.

6. Restart the computer.

7. Run the Exchange Server 5.5 Upgrade CD, and in the Microsoft Exchange Server
   Setup dialog box, click Add/Remove.

8. In the Exchange Server Setup Complete/Custom dialog box, click to select
   Outlook Web Access in the Options box.
