======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When more than one SNA Server client or Host Integration Server 2000 client are
hosted on a single Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000 Terminal Server computer,
invokable transaction programs fail to receive incoming conversation requests.
Instead, incoming requests may be routed to the wrong client, or the incoming
attach requests may be rejected with sense code 084C0000 = Transaction Program
Not Available - No Retry. When this occurs, SNA Server logs the following
event:

   Event ID: 60
   Source: SNA Server Service
   Description: Failed to invoke APPC TP [TP name], local LU [LU name], sense
   data = 084C0000

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server and Host Integration Server do not support the configuration of
invokable transaction programs on multiple SNA clients running on Windows NT 4.0
Terminal Server or Windows 2000 Terminal Server. SNA Server does not distinguish
between multiple SNA client connections running on the same Terminal Server
computer. Therefore, incoming attach requests are not routed properly to the
correct client instance.

STATUS
======

If there is a customer need for this feature, please contact Microsoft through
the regular SNA Server support channels. The request will be considered by the
product team for inclusion in the product.
