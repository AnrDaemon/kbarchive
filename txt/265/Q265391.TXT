TITLE   :XADM: Exchange Server Honors Message Expiry Even If Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Messages that come into an Exchange Server site may be rejected without
notification to the sender if the message has an expiry time and it is earlier
than the Exchange Server computer's current date and time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Users of Internet mail can set a message expiry time. This defines how long the
message will stay in the recipient's Inbox. If the expiry time of the incoming
message is earlier than the Exchange Server computer's current date and time,
the message is discarded without notification because the Exchange Server
computer recognizes the message as already expired.

This behavior is by design. E-mail clients set message expiry. Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol (SMTP) e-mail users should not stamp an outbound message with
expiry, and when they do SMTP e-mail clients act unexpectedly if the message
expiry has the current date and time as the message.
