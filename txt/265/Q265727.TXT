PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

While the Internet Mail Service tries to retrieve the next host address to
deliver a message, the Internet Mail Service may generate a Dr. Watson error
message. This behavior is most likely to occur after several unsuccessful
attempts to deliver a message.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because under very specific circumstances, the Internet
Mail Service continues to search for Internet protocol (IP) addresses to use to
deliver the message, even though there are no more IP addresses to try for a
given domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
