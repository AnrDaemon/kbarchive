SUMMARY
=======

When sharing Apple Macintosh volumes from a server running Microsoft Windows
2000 Server or Microsoft NT Server, Appleshare clients may not see more than 256
volumes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Appleshare clients viewing volumes from Windows 2000 Server or Windows NT Server
have a maximum viewable volume limit of 256. This limitation exists within the
Appleshare client, not the Windows-based server.

Windows 2000 Server and Windows NT Server allow the user to create more than 256
Apple Macintosh volumes. When more than 256 volumes are created, the Apple
Chooser may not populate the list of volumes properly. For example, not all
volumes are shown.

To verify this behavior, create more than 256 volumes on the server. Perform a
network trace on the traffic between the server and client while the Appleshare
client is retrieving the list of volumes. In one of the traced data fields sent
from the server to the client, the volumes are displayed.
