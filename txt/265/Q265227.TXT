TITLE   :XADM: Setup Won't Work w. "The Required Privilege..." Err. Mssg.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Exchange Server 5.5, Setup may not work and you may
receive the following error message:

   The required privilege is not held by the client.

The only option available is to click OK. When you click OK, you quit Setup.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Exchange Server Setup program is trying to write to
the Microsoft Windows NT Event Viewer application event log. To determine if
Setup is writing to the application event log, look at the Exchange Server
Setup.log file (located by default at the root of the drive).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Stop the Event Log service.

2. Navigate to the Winnt\System32\Config folder.

3. Rename the *.evt files.

4. Restart the server to re-create the *.evt log files.

After you perform these steps, the Exchange Server Setup program should run
properly.
