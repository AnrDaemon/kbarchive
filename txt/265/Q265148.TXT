======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Outlook Web Access (OWA) to send a meeting request, the
Conversation box is missing. However, if you use Microsoft Outlook, the
Conversation box is available.

When you send a meeting request that does not include the Conversation box, the
following behavior occurs:

 - When an attendee replies to the request, the Conversation box remains blank,
   and all similar e-mail messages are grouped in one section.

 - If the meeting request is sent to a Lotus Notes user, the Subject box is not
   displayed because Notes uses the Conversation box as the Subject box in a
   meeting request form.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the OWA code does not generate the Conversation box
in a meeting request.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, change the OWA code by using the following steps.

NOTE: Do not change any OWA code unless you fully understand the OWA structure
and have confirmed that the issue is severely affecting your business.

1. Stop the World Wide Web Publishing service.

2. Copy the Commands.asp folder that is located in the following folder:

   Exchsrvr\Webdata\<Language_version>\Forms\Ipm\Schedule\Meeting\Request

   NOTE: Because there are many Commands.asp files on your hard disk, make sure
   that you copy the Commands.asp file that is located in this folder. Also,
   make sure that you open the <Language_version> folder of the language
   you are using, for example, USA or CHS.

3. Paste the Commands.asp file to a safe location so that you can recover it
   when necessary.

4. Open Commands.asp with any text editor, and then locate the BindData
   function.

5. In the BindData function, add the following lines under the "IF bstrTab =
   "message" THEN" section:

   Sub BindData()

   ...
       IF bstrTab = "message" THEN
       
           ...'Add start here
           If objNewMsg.ConversationIndex = "" then      
                 
              objNewMsg.ConversationIndex = 
              objOMSession.CreateConversationIndex
                 objNewMsg.ConversationTopic = Request.Form("subject")

           End If
           ' Add end here
           ...

       Endif
           ...

   End Sub

6. Restart the World Wide Web Publishing service.

7. Create a new meeting request from OWA.
