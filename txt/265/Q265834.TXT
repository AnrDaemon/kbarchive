TITLE   :XCLN: Help File Gives Wrong Location to Set Default OWA Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Advanced tab in a Mailbox Properties dialog box, click Help,
and then click the Outlook Web Access Server Name option, the online
documentation indicates that you can specify the default Outlook Web Access
(OWA) server name on the General tab in the Private Information Store Properties
dialog box. But when you view this page, there is no option to set the OWA
server name.

RESOLUTION
==========

The correct location for setting the default Outlook Web Access Server Name
option is on the General tab in the Protocols Properties dialog box. This option
can be set for the entire site or on a per server basis.

To set the default OWA server in the Protocols Properties dialog box, follow
these steps:

1. Start the Exchange Administrator program.

2. Expand the Site (or Server container), and then click the Protocols object.

3. On the File menu, click Properties.

4. In the Protocols Properties dialog box, click the General tab.

5. In the Outlook Web Access Server Name box, enter the OWA server name.
