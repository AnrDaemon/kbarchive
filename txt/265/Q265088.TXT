TITLE   :XCLN: Free and Busy Details Unavailable from Different Time Zone
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::2000
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to view the details of free and busy data on the Attendee
Availability tab of an open Calendar item, you may receive the following
message:

   Details for this appointment are not available

This occurs when the Outlook workstation is on a different side of the Greenwich
mean time time zone than the Exchange Server computer that houses the free and
busy public folder (for example, when the Exchange Server free and busy server
is in the Pacific time zone [GMT-08:00] and the Outlook workstation is in the
Brussels, Copenhagen, Madrid, Paris time zone [GMT+01:00]).

==========
