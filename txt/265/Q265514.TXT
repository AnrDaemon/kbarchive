   Q237174 XIMS: IMAPISession::OpenMsgStore Leaks Approximately 40-60 Bytes Per
   Call

SYMPTOMS
========

Repeated calls to IMAPISession::OpenMsgStore cause a memory leak even after a
corresponding close function.

CAUSE
=====

An internal object is being constructed that, in turn, creates a critical
section. When the object is destroyed, the corresponding critical section is not
destroyed, resulting in a memory leak.

RESOLUTION
==========

The store provider .dll file has been corrected to release the memory that is
allocated by the critical section

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
