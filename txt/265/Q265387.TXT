-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Windows NT 4.0-based computer with a BIOS date that uses a four-digit date
for the year 2000, Windows NT Diagnostics (Winmsd.exe) truncates the date and
uses only the first two digits of the year 2000. For example, April 4, 2000, is
interpreted as 04/04/20 instead of 04/04/2000. The BIOS date information is
extracted from the following registry location:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\SystemBiosDate

CAUSE
=====

The CmpGetBiosDates function reads dates from the BIOS and populates the
registry entry each time the computer starts. Windows NT 4.0 assumes that dates
are in the form of a MM/DD/YY string. However, BIOS manufacturers have expanded
the date format to MM/DD/CCYY strings. If you run Windows NT 4.0 on a computer
that has the new BIOS format, the year field is misinterpreted.
