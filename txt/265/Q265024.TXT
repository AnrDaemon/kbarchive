PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you insert an odd page section break or an even page section break, a new
blank page may appear in print preview and when you print the document.

In addition, you may observe the following problems:

 - If your Word document contains page numbers, the page numbers may skip a page
   number.

 - The page number in your document may appear higher than you expect.

 - If your Word document contains a total number of pages field (a NUMPAGES
   field), the total number of pages shown is greater than you expect.

 - The page number on the status bar may skip a page number when you page
   through the document.

 - The total number of pages on the status bar may indicate a greater number of
   pages than you expect.


CAUSE
=====

This functionality is by design in Microsoft Word. When you insert an odd page
section break on an odd-numbered page, or an even page section break on an
even-numbered page, Word cannot move the following text to the next physical
page. Instead, Word moves the text that follows the section break to the next
appropriate odd page or even page of the document. To do this, Word has to
insert a blank page after the section break.

NOTE: The blank page that is inserted contains no header or footer. In addition,
it may appear that you cannot type text on the blank page.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent the blank page when you view the document in print preview, to allow
the page numbers to be printed correctly for each page, and to use the page for
additional text in the document, do one of the following:

Method 1: Type Text or Press ENTER
----------------------------------

On the page that precedes the odd page section break or even page section break,
move the insertion point to the end of the text on that page. Either type
additional text to fill out that page and continue onto the blank page, or press
ENTER until the insertion point is on the blank page. Then type the additional
text that you want on the page.

Method 2: Insert a Page Break
-----------------------------

Insert a page break immediately before the odd page section break or even page
section break. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the View menu, click Normal.

2. Move the insertion point to the end of the text that precedes the Section
   Break (Odd Page) or Section Break (Even Page).

3. Do one of the following:

    - Press CTRL+ENTER to insert a manual (hard) page break.

      -or-

    - On the Insert menu, click Break. In the Break dialog box, click to select
      "Page break", and then click OK.

      -or-

    - On the Insert menu, click Break. In the Break dialog box, click to select
      Next Page (listed under "Section breaks"), and then click OK.
