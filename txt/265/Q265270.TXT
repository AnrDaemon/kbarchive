TITLE   :SMS: Assigned Programs Are Not Started After SMS Installation

KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you initial System Management Server (SMS), installation pending
advertisements are not run until one of the following events occurs:

 - If the user logs off and then logs back on.

   -or-

 - If the user opens the Advertised Programs tool in Control Panel.

   -or-

 - If the user manually starts Launch32.exe

This problem occurs only if the user has low permission levels on a computer that
is running Windows 2000.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because the SMS client depends on the presence of
Launch32.exe to determine if a user is logged on.

When a user with low permission levels installs the SMS client software, the
installation does not work before Launch32.exe is run. The installation is later
completed remotely by the site server; however, because Launch32.exe is not
running, the user who is logged on is not detected and software distribution
that depends on this state does not occur.

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
these files may also contain additional files.



How to Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local folder on your site server or to
   a share on your network. It is important to keep the folder structure intact
   because the Q265270.exe update is dependant on the folder structure. The
   Q265270.exe file is a Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific
   files on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
   privileges.

3. On the site server, close the Systems Management Server Administrator
   console.

4. Run the Q265270.exe file and follow the directions in the wizard.

How to Manually Install the Hotfix:

NOTE: You can use this method for both Intel-based and Alpha-based primary site
servers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local folder on your site server or to
   a share on your network.

2. Close the Systems Management Server Administrator console.

3. Stop all SMS services.

4. Copy the following files from the appropriate hotfix folder to the specified
   path, where <Platform> is either I386 or Alpha. A site server that is
   running on an Intel-based platform needs only the hotfix files from the I386
   hotfix folder. A site server that is running on an Alpha-based platform needs
   only the hotfix files from the Alpha hotfix folder.

   SMS\Bin\<Platform> folder:

   Abnwcli.dll
   Abnwsvr.dll
   Baseobj.dll
   Bindclin.dll
   Boot32nd.exe
   Boot32nw.exe
   Boot32wn.exe

   SMS\Bin\<Platform>\00000409 folder:

   Smsman.exe

   SMS\Bin\<Platform>\System32 folder:

   Mfc42.dll
   Mfc42u.dll

   Msvcrt.dll

   SMS\Licmtr\Odbc\<Platform> folder:

   Msvcrt40.dll (in the SMS\Bin\<Platform>\System32 folder)

   SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\<Platform> folder:

   Ccmcore.exe
   Clicore.exe

   SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder:

   Comp1130.ini

   SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32\<Platform> folder:

   Apasetup.exe

   SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32 folder:

   Comp1103.ini

   SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Swdist folder:

   Comp1103.ini

   SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Swdist\<Platform> folder:

   Swdist.exe
