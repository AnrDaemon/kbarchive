TITLE   :FP: Err Msg Installing Server Extensions with Disk-Based Web
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 2002 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 2000 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing the FrontPage Server Extensions to a virtual server, you
receive the following error message:

   The document root of the web server where you are trying to install the
   server extensions already contains a disk-based web.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when the Web site is opened directly from the FrontPage
client through the file path or a mapped drive. This behavior can also occur if
the site was created as a disk-based Web and then copied into the document root
on the Web server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Using Windows Explorer, go to the document root of the virtual server.

2. In the _vti_pvt folder, locate a file called Service.cnf.

3. Open this file with Notepad.

4. Remove the following lines:

   vti_httpdversion:SX|FrontPage DBW
   vti_webservertype:SR|diskweb

5. Save the changes.
