   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to hide your server's computer name and comment from
other computers in the domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To hide the server's computer name and comment from other computers in the
domain, ensure that the Hidden value name in the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters
registry key has a value of "1".

The following steps describe how to add the preceding value to the registry:

1. Start Registry Editor (the Regedt32.exe tool).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer
   \Parameters

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

   Value Name: hidden
   Data Type: REG_BINARY
   Value: 1

4. Quit Registry Editor.

NOTE: This setting can also be changed using the "net config server
/hidden:yes|no" command.
