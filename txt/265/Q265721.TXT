TITLE   :DOC: /CEConfig Switch Builds Incorrect Platform
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocerr kbDSupport kbGrpDSETK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ version 3.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the products listed above to build a project from the command line,
the /CEConfig= switch is used to select the target platform. This switch is case
sensitive and is followed by an equal sign (=). The online documentation
incorrectly implies that the switch is case insensitive and does not contain an
equal sign (CEConfig).

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you build a project from the command line, the build defaults the target
device to the WCE Configuration that was last used when the respective workspace
was closed. You can observe the platform that is being targeted in the build
steps. For example, if you disable banner suppression (remove/nologo) for the
compiler in a C++ project that was last built for Pocket PC, you see several
variables, including the following:

   /D _WIN32_WCE=300 /D "WIN32_PLATFORM_PSPC"

If you then build the project and specify the H/PC Pro 2.11 Windows CE
configuration as illustrated in the documentation, these build parameters do not
change and a Pocket PC executable is produced.

If you implement the solution in this article, the desired platform is correctly
selected. For example, to rebuild all configurations for project "TEST"
targeting the Handheld PC Professional 3.0 platform, use the following command
line:

   "EVC test.vcp /MAKE "ALL" /CEConfig="H/PC Pro 2.11" /REBUILD" (without the
   quotation marks)

The previously mentioned build variables should reflect the proper platform:

   /D _WIN32_WCE=211 /D "WIN32_PLATFORM_HPCPRO"
