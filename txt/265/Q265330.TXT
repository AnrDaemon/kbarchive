SUMMARY
=======

By default, Microsoft Exchange Server's connector for System Network
Architecture Distribution Services (SNADS) formats the body of a message from a
SNADS system as a text attachment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change this behavior so that the message text is received in the body of a
message, remove the comment (;) tag and change the value for "FinalDocInBody="
from No to Yes in the [LME-SNADS] section of the Exchconn.ini file:
