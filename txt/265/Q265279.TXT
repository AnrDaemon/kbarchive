SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to delete a file that has previously been accessed through a Web
browser and is located under the Internet Information Server (IIS) folder
structure (for example, \\WWWServerName\Wwwroot), the following error message
may appear:

   Error Deleting File: Cannot (filename): There has been a sharing violation.
   The source of destination file may be in use. You cannot delete filename.

After you turn off file caching by setting the registry key:

   HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Inetinfo\Parameters\DisableMemoryCache

IIS is still caching the file.

CAUSE
=====

In addition to DisableMemoryCache, there is another registry key affecting
caching. Under the following registry key:

   HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Inetinfo\Parameters

you will find that there is also a value called MemoryCacheSize. This may be
there from a previous version of IIS on a computer that was then upgraded to IIS
4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========


WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this problem, you can delete the MemoryCacheSize key under:

   HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Inetinfo\Parameters

and reboot the computer. To do so, use Registry Editor or a different editor to
delete the relevant key.

If this does not help, install the latest service pack for Windows NT.
