TITLE   :XADM: Exmerge Error Message: CMapiSession::CreateEMSPSTProfile
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Merge program (Exmerge) to move data
from a mailbox to a personal folder file (.pst file) on an Exchange Server
computer that is a recovery server, Exmerge may generate the following error
message several times for a variety of users:

   [07:00:21] Copying data from mailbox 'Smith, John' ('JSmith') on Server
   'EXCH1' to file 'D:\EXMERGE\EXMERGEDATA\JSMITH.PST'.
   [07:00:21] Error configuring message service (MSEMS) (UNKNOWN ERROR)
   (CMapiSession::CreateEMSPSTProfile) [07:00:21] Errors encountered. Copy
   process aborted.

In the Exchange Server Administrator program, the restored mailboxes are
displayed on the Mailbox Resources tab, but not in the Recipients container.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the directory has not been synchronized with the
information store on the recovery server. If the recovered mailboxes are not
displayed in the Recipients container, you are experiencing the issue that is
described in this article.

This issue only occurs when you are restoring an information store.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, run the DS/IS consistency adjuster (on the Advanced tab
of the server properties). After you run the DS/IS consistency adjuster, Exmerge
runs successfully. Be aware that the DS/IS consistency adjuster may rehome
public folders if there are other servers in the site or other sites in the
organization. For additional information about the DS/IS consistency adjuster,
