SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how the RDISK.EXE utility updates repair information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following changes occur to the repair directory when you update the repair
information:

1. System._ is deleted.

2. $$Hive$$.tmp is created. (This is the system hive being regenerated.)

3. Some DC##.tmp files are generated in the user's Home directory. If the user
   does not have a Home directory, the files are generated on the root directory
   of the partition. There will be five DC##.tmp files created and then deleted
   for each new hive that is generated.

4. $$Hive$$.tmp is compressed and called System._.

5. Software._ is deleted.

6. $$Hive$$.tmp is created. (This is the software hive being regenerated.)

7. $$Hive$$.tmp is compressed and called Software._.

8. Ntuser.da_ is deleted.

9. $$Hive$$.tmp file is created. (This is the default user profile being
   generated by copying Winnt\Profiles\Default user\Ntuser.dat.)

10. $$Hive$$.tmp is compressed and called Ntuser.da_. (All other files remain
   untouched unless rdisk -s is used; in that case, Sam._ and Security._ are
   also replaced.)

11. You are prompted to make an Emergency Repair Disk (ERD).

12. If you reply Yes, all the files in the repair directory are copied to the
   ERD.
