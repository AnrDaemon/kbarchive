TITLE   :XFOR: Outbound X.400 Message Created by CDO May Result in NDR
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A message created by Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) with an attachment but no
body, may be rejected as undeliverable by a foreign X.400 system. If a similar
message is created by using Microsoft Outlook 2000, it is successfully accepted
by the foreign system.

CAUSE
=====

When you use CDO to create a message that contains an attachment, but no body,
the PR_BODY field appears to be null. When this is converted to X.400 format, a
P2_IA5Text body part is created with a hexadecimal value of 16 00. The "00" may
cause the receiving foreign X.400 system to assume that the message is
malformed, and reject it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4.
