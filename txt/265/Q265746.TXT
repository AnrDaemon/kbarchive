TITLE   :PRB: eVB: Scrollbars Appear Incorrectly in Run Mode
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport kbVBM300

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you place a small horizontal or vertical scrollbar on a form, the scrollbar
appears blank or without arrows, depending on the size of the control.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs because of the way that Windows CE handles the painting of
the control.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new HPC Pro or Pocket PC project in eMbedded Visual Basic. Form1 is
   created by default.

2. Add a vertical scrollbar to Form1.

3. Add the following code to Form1:

   Private Sub Form_Load()
            VScroll1.Height = 450
   End Sub

4. Press the F5 key to run the project in emulation. Notice that no arrows
   appear in the scrollbar.

5. Change the code provided in Step 3 to read:

   Private Sub Form_Load()
            VScroll1.Height = 250
   End Sub

6. Press the F5 key to run the project. Notice that in the HPC Pro project you
   get a white rectangle, while in the Pocket PC project no scrollbar appears on
   the form.
