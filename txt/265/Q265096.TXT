TITLE   :"Stop 41" Error Message Occurs and Event 2000 Is Logged
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows NT Server, you may receive the following error message:

   Stop 00000041 (0x00001000 0x00007924 0x00000420 0x00038f53)

NOTE: The parameters may vary.

In addition, event ID 2000 messages with error codes of C000009A are reported in
the system event log, with the following message:

   STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES ((NTSTATUS)0xC000009AL).

CAUSE
=====

Both the event message and the error message occur because the non-paged pool
memory resource is depleted. (Windows NT 4.0 contains a maximum of 128 MB of
non-paged pool memory, and Windows 2000 has a maximum of 256 MB.) The non-paged
pool leak is caused by the Emulex Fiber SCSI controller driver (Elxsli2.sys).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Emulex is in the process of addressing this issue.
