SUMMARY
=======

On a device that supports the Microsoft Windows palette management APIs, an
application can create a logical palette, select the palette into a Device
Context (DC), and realize the palette. Realizing a logical palette maps its
colors to the system (hardware) color palette. The GetDeviceCaps() API is
available to inform an application whether the device is capable of supporting
palette management functions and, if so, the size of its system palette. This
article discusses the different types of logical palettes and the effect of each
on the system palette when a logical palette is realized.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a logical palette is selected into a DC, it can be selected as either a
foreground or a background palette. Setting the bForceBackground parameter of
the SelectPalette() API to TRUE selects the palette as a background palette. If
this parameter is FALSE, the palette can be selected as a foreground palette. A
palette will be selected as a foreground palette only if the DC into which the
palette is selected is one of the five cached DCs managed by the GetDC() API and
the DC is retrieved on behalf of the active window. If the DC is returned by
CreateDC() or CreateCompatibleDC() or if the window is not the active window,
the palette will be forced into the background.

The status as a foreground or a background palette affects how the colors in the
logical palette are mapped into the system palette when the logical palette is
realized.

When a foreground palette is realized, every entry in the system palette that can
be modified by an application is accessible to the logical palette. Logical
palette entries are mapped into the system palette starting at the first
available entry. Because a logical palette entry that exactly matches a reserved
system palette entry is mapped to that system entry, it does not consume a
separate palette slot. If the logical palette has more entries than available
slots in the system palette, the available slots are filled, in order, from the
logical palette. The remaining logical palette entries are mapped to the closest
colors already present in the system palette. There is one exception to this
rule: if a logical palette entry is marked with the PC_RESERVED flag, no colors
will be mapped to that entry. If all available system palette entries are
reserved, additional colors will not be mapped to any entry and will be
displayed as black on the screen.

A palette entry marked as PC_NOCOLLAPSE will always take a separate slot if
available, just as for PC_RESERVED. Unlike a PC_RESERVED color, if no slots are
available, it will map to the nearest color, and other colors may map onto it.

The first available entry in the system palette is the first palette entry not
marked as used. For example, assume a device with 256 palette entries, 20 of
which are reserved for the system. An application realizes a palette of 36
colors on this device; therefore, the first 36 entries are marked used. Another
application realizes a 100-entry palette; therefore, the next 100 entries are
marked used. If a third application receives the input focus and realizes a
foreground palette with 236 entries, Windows maps the first 100 colors into the
remainder of the system palette. Each of the remaining 136 colors of the logical
palette is mapped into the closest color available in the system palette.

When a background palette is realized, any empty positions in the system palette
are filled. Any colors that remain are mapped to the closest color in the system
palette. A background palette entry cannot overlay a foreground entry in the
system palette; however, a foreground palette entry can overlay a background
entry in the system palette.
