SUMMARY
=======

The MS-DOS 5 Upgrade Setup program may hang at 7% complete if a virus is present
on the computer. To work around this problem, boot from an original MS-DOS
floppy disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem has been observed in two specific situations:

 - Setup hangs if the Bloody virus is present on the hard drive. The Bloody
   virus installs itself in memory, infects the boot sector of a floppy disk and
   the partition table of the hard disk. After approximately 128 reboots, the
   virus displays the message "Bloody! Jun. 4,1989" during bootup. The message
   refers to the date of the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, China.

 - Setup hangs if the Stoned virus is present. The Stoned virus can corrupt
   system or overlay files, including *.COM files such as the COMMAND.COM.

In both situations, the solution is to boot from an original MS-DOS floppy disk,
then run Setup again. Write-protect the original MS-DOS floppy disk so that it
does not get infected with any viruses.

This work around may enable MS-DOS 5 Upgrade to complete the installation
program. Use virus checking software as soon as possible to eliminate any
potential viruses.
