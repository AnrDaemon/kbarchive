SYMPTOMS
========

When a printer is temporarily out of service because the paper is jammed, no
paper is in the paper tray, or the printer is off-line, normally a message is
sent to the DOS or OS/2 workstation stating that the printer is unavailable to
complete the print job. However, quite often a DOS Enhanced workstation will not
display the message concerning the unavailability of the printer.

CAUSE
=====

The messenger section of LANMAN.INI contains a parameter called sizmessbuf. On
OS/2 workstations, the default value for sizmessbuf is 4096 bytes. On DOS
Enhanced workstations, the default value for sizmessbuf is 256. When a message
is received whose total size is larger than the message buffer size, the message
is dropped. The printer unavailability message can easily exceed the 256-byte
buffer size.

RESOLUTION
==========

Increase sizmessbuf to accommodate longer messages. Doubling the default value
to a 512 byte buffer should be sufficient for the printer messages. Please note,
however, that doubling this value will affect the total available memory to the
DOS workstation.
