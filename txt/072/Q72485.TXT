TITLE   :Error Copying Files During Entertainment Pack Setup

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

When running Setup for the Windows Entertainment Pack (WEP), you may receive the
following error message:

   There was an error copying files to your <WINDOWS DIR> subdirectory.
   Please correct the problem and run Setup again.

This error message normally occurs if there is not enough free disk space to
install the Windows Entertainment Pack. However, you may receive this error if
there is ample disk space for Setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have ample disk space for Setup, a workaround is to create a new
directory and to copy the files from the Entertainment Pack disk(s) into this
new directory. Then run the Entertainment Pack Setup directly from the hard
drive.
