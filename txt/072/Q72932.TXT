The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you print to a file using the PostScript driver with Windows, the File
Print command may not produce an Output Filename box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The absence of an Output Filename box results when a filename has already been
supplied in the Options section of the printer setup process (see below).

To verify the existence of a filename, do the following:

1. From Control Panel, select Printers. The installed printers box will list:

   Postscript Printer on File: Active

2. If you are using Windows version 3.0, choose Configure. If you are using
   Windows 3.1, skip this step.

3. Choose Setup.

4. Choose Options. In the Print To section, Encapsulated Postscript File is
   selected and a filename is in the File box. Removing the assigned filename
   will restore the Output Filename box. Also, make sure there are no spaces in
   this file box. Spaces will produce a

   Cannot Print

   message.
