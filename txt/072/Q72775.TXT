SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail, sending a mail message with the Urgent option selected does
not give the mail message a greater priority in the Mail system and does not
decrease the time it takes for the mail message to be delivered.

If the Urgent option is selected for a mail message and the recipient of the mail
message has selected Display Urgent Messages Immediately in the Preferences
dialog box (on the Mail menu), the mail message will be automatically opened and
displayed on the recipient's workstation.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.00a 2.00b 3.00
