TITLE   :CodeView Does Not Detect M61xx Math Errors

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft CodeView for OS/2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An attempt to use CodeView to determine which source code statement
causes a "M61xx" math error fails because CodeView is not designed to
detect the C run-time library called an application's error-handling
function. CodeView does not differentiate an error-handling function
from others in the application.

If you run the program in the CodeView debugger, the "M61xx" error may
occur, but CodeView does not halt execution at that point. Instead,
CodeView displays either the "Program terminated normally" or "Thread
terminated normally" message, changes the display to assembly language
mode, and displays the C run-time library termination code. The Calls
menu does not provide any indication of where the error occurred.
CodeView for Windows displays an "Application Error" message and does
not display any source code.

Because the error-handling function calls the operating system to
terminate the process, CodeView detects a normal application
termination and acts accordingly: displaying a termination message and
displaying the C run-time library termination code in assembly
language mode.

To debug math errors with CodeView, set breakpoints at strategic
locations before you run the application or animate the program at key
points to see each line before it executes.

Unlike CodeView, the QuickC integrated debugger places the cursor on
the line that causes the math error if you select Animate from the Run
menu.
