The information in this article applies to:

Page 521 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0
incorrectly states:

   A permanent Windows swap file consists of two hidden, write- protected files.
   The files are named SPART.PAR and 386SPART.PAR. Do not delete, move, or
   rename these files."

The 386SPART.PAR file is hidden but not write-protected, while
SPART.PAR is write-protected (read-only attribute) but not hidden.

Performing a directory listing from the MS-DOS prompt of the Windows
directory using "DIR *.PAR" will show the SPART.PAR. Through File
Manager, performing a Search for *.PAR with or without showing
HIDDEN/SYSTEMS FILES, will show both files.
