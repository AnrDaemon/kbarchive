TITLE   :QRAM 1.01 LOADHI FILES +M Command Fails Under DOS 5.0

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Running Quarterdeck's QRAM version 1.01 LOADHI FILES +M command in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file under Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0 will hang your machine.
Having this command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file will also cause QRAM's optimize
program to go into an endless loop, displaying the message "optimize signature"
on the screen. This is a problem in QRAM's FILES.COM program that Quarterdeck is
aware of and currently researching.

Until a new version of QRAM is released, the only workarounds are to not use the
LOADHI FILES +M command or to use the FILES.COM program from QRAM version 1.0.
