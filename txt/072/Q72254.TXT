SUMMARY
=======

Novell technical support reports that the user's personal directory must precede
the shared Windows directory in the user's PATH statement or NetWare search
drives.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, Windows will suggest this arrangement, but if Windows is not allowed
to modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT, then the modification must be done manually.

It is also possible to leave Windows out of the PATH statement, and instead use
the Novell MAP ROOT command and search drives to set the directories in proper
order, since you will be logging into the server before running Windows.
