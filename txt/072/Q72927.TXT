SUMMARY
=======

Flipping the DIVER.FSH file either horizontally or vertically causes your
computer to stop responding (hang) or causes a series of error messages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows Resource Kit (WRK) contains a shareware utility called Windows 3.0
Fish. This utility is a screen saver program that inserts fish graphics onto
your screen and makes your monitor appear like a fish bowl. This program allows
you to edit fish species and create your own. Attempting to flip DIVER.FSH
results in one or more of the following:

 - Your system hangs.

 - Several dialog boxes (usually 4-5) and corresponding buttons (usually 5-6)
   with the word "Error" on the title bar and the words "Fishedit.cxxxx" in the
   box cascade on your screen.

 - In Windows 3.0, an Unrecoverable Application Error message is displayed. In
   Windows 3.1, a dialog box appears with an Application Error message. You can
   choose the Close button and close Fish without quitting Windows.

 - The MS-DOS prompt appears in the top left corner with no cursor (you should
   have keyboard control, however). To retrieve the cursor, type "mode 80"
   (without the quotation marks) at the prompt and press the ENTER key.
