PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a,3.1,3.11

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows Calculator (CALC.EXE) does not reliably subtract two numbers
with decimal values. This problem occurs in both modes (standard and scientific)
of Calculator.

CAUSE
=====

Calculator does not round the decimal values properly. While Calculator is
determining how to display the solution, it encounters a loss of precision and
shows an incorrect answer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows 3.0
-----------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 3.0.

Windows 3.1x, Windows for Workgroups 3.1x
-----------------------------------------

To correct this problem in Windows 3.1x and Windows for Workgroups 3.1x, obtain
the updated CALC.EXE file from the Microsoft Web site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Calculator.

2. Input the largest number to subtract first (for example, 12.52).

3. Press the MINUS SIGN (-) key on the numeric keypad.

4. Input the smaller number that is one unit lower in the decimal portion (for
   example, 12.51).

5. Press the EQUAL SIGN (=) key on the numeric keypad.

Subtracting 12.51 from 12.52 results in one of the following incorrect numbers:

   0.00
   0.0099999999
   0.010000001
