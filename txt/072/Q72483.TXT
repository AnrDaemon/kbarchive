The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When installing the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0, the Setup
program will copy the .HLP help files to the directory you specify. If you
install the files in the same directory in which you installed Microsoft C
version 6.0a, you may notice that the following entries in the Categories menu
in QuickHelp are missing:

   NMAKE       NMK      LINK     ILINK       LIB
   BIND        EXEHDR   CVPACK   HELPMAKE    QuickHelp

In the place of these entries is a single entry called "Utilities". This is
correct behavior because the new version of PWB.HLP defines all the utility
categories under one title.

Additional query words: kbinf 6.00 6.00a 6.00b
