SUMMARY
=======

A bitmap (.BMP) file created in Paintbrush appears not to center or tile on your
desktop if the image attributes in Paintbrush were not set to the correct size
of the image.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the attributes are not set to the correct size, the blank desktop space in
Paintbrush will be saved as part of the image. Consequently, when the file is
brought up as wallpaper, the image will not appear to be tiled or centered
because of the Paintbrush workspace that was saved with the image. However, the
image actually is tiled or centered.

To get the desired results, the image attributes must be set before the image is
drawn.
