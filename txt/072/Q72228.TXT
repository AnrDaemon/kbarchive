TITLE   :BUG: Installing MASM 6.0 for OS/2 May Result in a Setup Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.0,6.0a,6.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbMASM kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 for OS/2
protected mode only, a file creation error may occur.

After the setup program prompts you to insert the MS-DOS Utilities disk, the
following error message appears:

   An error occurred while creating the file ....\BIN\MLX.EXE

RESOLUTION
==========

When "Ignore the error and continue" is selected, the installation will continue
successfully.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM for OS/2 versions 6.0,
6.0a, and 6.0b. This is not a problem in MASM for MS-DOS versions 6.0, 6.0a, or
6.0b. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Run the MASM 6.0 setup program, SETUP.EXE.

2. Select the "Install the Microsoft Macro Assembler" option.

3. Select "OS/2 Protected Mode".

With the 720K 3.5-inch disks, the error occurs after copying H2INC.EXE from the
MS-DOS Utilities disk.

With the 1.2-megabyte 5.25-inch disks, the error occurs as soon as SETUP.EXE
begins copying files from the MS-DOS Utilities disk. The 360K 5.25-inch disks
are only used to install for DOS real mode, so the problem is not observed with
these disks.
