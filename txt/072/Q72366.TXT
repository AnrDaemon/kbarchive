SUMMARY
=======

Quattro Pro creates its own disk cache with up to 512K of extended memory if you
include /x on the command line when you start the program. For example:

      C:\Quattro\q.exe /x

If SMARTDrive is installed and the Quattro Pro disk cache is active, Quattro Pro
runs much more slowly. If this is the case, do not include /x on the command
line or in the PIF settings Optional Parameters field.
