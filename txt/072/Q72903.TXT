SUMMARY
=======

Hewlett-Packard (HP) has a line of electrostatic plotters designated series
7600. These are high-speed, high-volume printers that use laser-like technology
to print full-size drawings in less than one minute. These drawings are at a 406
dpi resolution with 64 shades of gray. When printing in full-color, it takes
less than eight minutes for a full-size drawing. These times do not include
transmission time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These plotters have three built-in interfaces. They are the RS-232 serial, IEEE
488-1978 parallel, and Centronics parallel. They use the HP-GL/2 command
language and will emulate HP-7586B plotters when used with most DOS applications
or Microsoft Windows. They are designed primarily for use with graphics
workstations. The internal rasterizer uses a 32-bit Motorola 68020 and a
40-megabyte hard disk.

There are three models available at this time:

 - 

   Model 250       B/W     24-inch wide plots

 - 

   Model 255       B/W     36-inch wide plots

 - 

   Model 355       Clr     36-inch wide plots

As with all HP printers or plotters, use an HP cable to ensure that the printer
will function properly.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
