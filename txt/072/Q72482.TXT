TITLE   :FIX: MASM 6.0 May Generate A2103 Error When Assembling with /Zi
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.0,6.0a,6.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b may generate
the following error if a large module is assembled with /Zi to generate CodeView
symbolic information:

   error A2103: segment exceeds 64K limit

CAUSE
=====

If you are not near the 64K limit in code or data, it is possible that the
$$SYMBOL segment created for CodeView's symbolic information has grown too
large.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you require full symbolic information, the only workaround is to split the
module up into smaller files and reassemble. If you only need line numbers to
debug this module, you can use the /Zd (generate line numbers) switch as a
workaround.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 6.0, 6.0a, and
6.0b. This problem was corrected in MASM for MS-DOS version 6.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that the A2103 error may occur even when your source module is defined with
the ".386" and ".MODEL flat" directives because MASM version 6.0 always defines
the $$SYMBOL segment as a 16-bit segment.
