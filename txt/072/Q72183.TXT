SUMMARY
=======

The following are device drivers included with MS-DOS version 5.0 that are safe
to load into upper memory blocks (UMBs):

   EGA.SYS          DISPLAY.SYS     ANSI.SYS
   RAMDRIVE.SYS     SMARTDRV.SYS    DRIVER.SYS
   PRINTER.SYS

The following are terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs included with MS-DOS
5.0 that are safe to load into UMBs:

   DOSKEY.COM       DOSSHELL.COM    KEYB.COM     SETVER.EXE  GRAFTABL.COM
   GRAPHICS.COM     NLSFUNC.EXE     MODE.COM     ASSIGN.COM
   SHARE.EXE        PRINT.EXE       APPEND.EXE   FASTOPEN.EXE

MIRROR.COM will automatically load high (into a UMB). For more information, query
on the following words:

   "MIRROR" (without the quotation marks) and "UMB" (without the quotation
   marks) and "5.00" (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

For each device driver (from the above list) that you want to load into a UMB,
do the following:

Note: Device drivers are loaded through the CONFIG.SYS file with a DEVICE= line.

1. Make sure DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS is loaded above the DEVICE=EMM386.EXE line and
   that the line DOS=HIGH,UMB is in the CONFIG.SYS file.

2. Change the DEVICE= line, which is used to load the following device drivers,
   to DEVICEHIGH= in the CONFIG.SYS file. For example:

   devicehigh=c:\dos\ansi.sys

For each TSR that is loaded in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and is safe to load into a
UMB, add the LOADHIGH (LH) command before the TSR. (LH is equivalent to
LOADHIGH.) For example, you can change the line

   c:\dos\doskey

to the following:

   lh c:\dos\doskey
