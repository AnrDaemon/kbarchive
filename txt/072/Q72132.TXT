SUMMARY
=======

The BACKUP command in MS-DOS version 5.0 does not work correctly when the
destination disk is unformatted and you try to write a log file to that
unformatted disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

BACKUP appears to be trying to write the log file to the destination disk before
formatting the disk. For example, the following command results in an error if
the disk in the destination drive is unformatted:

   backup c:\dos5\*.exe a: /f:360 /l:a:\backup.txt

The disk in drive A spins for a short time, at which point the following message
is displayed:

   General failure error reading drive A
   Abort, Retry, Fail?

Choosing each of the three options produces different behavior:

1. Choosing Abort causes the program to be successfully aborted.

2. Choosing Retry causes the error to be repeated.

3. Choosing Fail results in BACKUP asking for a disk to be inserted into drive A
   and produces the following message:

   WARNING! Files in target drive A:
   A:\ root directory will be erased
   Press any key to continue . . .

   After a key is pressed, the FORMAT command is invoked, and the disk is
   successfully formatted. The following message then appears:

   ***Backing up files to drive A:***
   Diskette Number: 01

   It is quickly followed by the message:

   Error opening logfile

   At this point, the BACKUP program terminates and the DOS prompt appears. The
   disk in Drive A has no files and contains a label of "BACKUP 001".
