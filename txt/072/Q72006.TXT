The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The AST Premium 286 is noted with an asterisk in the "Windows Version
3.0 Hardware Compatibility List," indicating that it needs special
handling during the installation process. This computer does not need
special handling; the "MS-DOS and PC-DOS machines" entry should be
chosen.

When the "All 80386 and 80486 based AST machines" entry is chosen, an
EMMExclude statement is added to the [386enh] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file. This statement is unnecessary for 80286 machines.

Additional query words: 3.0 3.00 win30 hcl
