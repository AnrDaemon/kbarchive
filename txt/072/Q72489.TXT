The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 4.01a, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

LINK.EXE will combine compiled programs with the .OBJ extension and produce an
executable (.EXE) file. However, the linker that came with your language package
should always be used first. The LINK.EXE file that shipped with MS-DOS will not
recognize any specific concerns for the language you are using and may fail.

LINK may or may not work in any given situation. Determining the reasons for a
LINK failure is virtually impossible, and therefore, Microsoft does not provide
technical support for this portion of the MS-DOS environment.

This information does not directly apply to Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0, because
LINK was not included. However, it is possible that you may have difficulty
linking your programs after installing MS-DOS 5.0.

During the installation process, MS-DOS 5.0 leaves LINK or any other linking
programs in the DOS subdirectory. (It does not delete any files that it doesn't
need to copy to the hard drive.) It also adds C:\DOS to the beginning of the
PATH statement.

An earlier DOS LINK utility or even a linker from another language could end up
first in the searchlist. When you attempt to link files, you may get strange new
errors or may not even be able to start the linker. If this happens, delete the
undesired linking program and make sure the PATH includes the subdirectory
containing the linker you are using.
