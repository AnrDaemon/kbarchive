SUMMARY
=======

When creating a tiny model program (.COM file) with the Microsoft Programmer's
WorkBench (PWB) version 1.1, it is important to have "Main Language" set to "C",
instead of using "None", which is the default. If Main Language is set to None,
the following LINK error is generated:

   LINK: fatal error L1127: far segment references not allowed with /TINY

The error occurs because CRTCOM.LIB, which contains the C startup code for .COM
programs, does not get linked in when Main Language is set to None. This results
in segment references to both code and data that are in two different segments.
Since a .COM program must have both the code and data in a single segment, the
L1127 error is generated.

You can check the Main Language setting by selecting the Options menu and
choosing Build Options. In the Build Options dialog box you can see your Main
Language selection and you can also change it there, if necessary. If you
receive the L1127 error when trying to build a .COM file inside PWB, make sure
your Main Language is set to an appropriate language and then rebuild your
project.
