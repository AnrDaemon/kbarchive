-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may not be able to determine the mode Microsoft Windows version 3.0 is
running in if you are using a shell other than Program Manager. For example,
using the MS-DOS Executive as the Windows shell allows you to determine the
amount of memory and resources, as well as the disk space, but not the current
mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two ways to find out what mode Windows is in:

Method 1
--------

From inside Windows, run WINVER.EXE.

NOTE: Running WINVER.EXE from MS-DOS returns only the version of Windows, not the
mode.

Method 2
--------

Start File Manager and choose About File Manager from the Help menu.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.00a win30
