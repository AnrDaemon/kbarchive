SUMMARY
=======

The following is a list of Windows Entertainment Pack (WEP) files that differ in
size, after installation, between versions 1.0 and 1.0a:

   Filename        1.00    1.00a
   --------        -----   -----

   ABOUTTET.DLL    10128   10224
   IDLEWILD.EXE    12800   12928
   IWLIB.DLL        7550    7518
   TETRIS.EXE      62032   64784
   TIC.EXE         20706   16944
   WINMINE.EXE     31248   26976

If the original disks are unavailable, the easiest way to distinguish between
Windows Entertainment Pack versions is to look at the sizes of the files on the
hard disk. The file dates of these files reflect the system-clock date at the
time of installation.
