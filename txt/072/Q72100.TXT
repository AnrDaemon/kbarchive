SUMMARY
=======

WordPerfect technical support has confirmed that the Retrieve function in
WordPerfect version 5.1 needs the MS-DOS APPEND command to work properly.
However, the APPEND command is not compatible with Microsoft Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The WordPerfect Retrieve function (SHIFT+F10) is used to quickly search the hard
disks for all WordPerfect data files, no matter which directory they are located
in. APPEND is used for this function.

WordPerfect technical support suggests that when using the Retrieve command
without APPEND, you supply the full logical path to the file:

For example, instead of using

   MYFILE.WP

use the path:

   C:\MYFILE\MYFILE.WP
