The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 ships with HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.SYS,
RAMDRIVE.SYS, and MOUSE.COM. These device drivers are the same drivers from the
Windows 3.0a disk set, yet the file dates on all but SMARTDRV.SYS do not match
the Windows 3.0a file dates.

You should treat the MASM 6.0 drivers as if they came with Windows 3.0a, because
they are the same. Using the MASM 6.0 drivers with Windows does not create any
compatibility problems with Windows 3.0.

This information applies to Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a. This
information does not apply to later versions of Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although the files are exactly the same, the file dates on the MASM 6.0 files do
