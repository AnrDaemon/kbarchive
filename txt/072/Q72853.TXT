TITLE   :BUG: H2INC Produces Garbage/GP Faults w/ Some Function Typedefs
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:OS/2:1.0; winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, the Microsoft C to MASM Include File Translator
(H2INC) version 1.0 that ships with the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version
6.0 may generate invalid results for certain C include files with function
typedefs. Under MS-DOS, the result may be garbage characters in the generated
.INC file. Under OS/2, H2INC may cause a general protection violation (GP
Fault).

The problem occurs in this file only when all the following conditions are true:

 - Two consecutive typedefs in the file are used to define functions.

 - The total argument count for the two typedefs is 10 or more.

 - The last argument to the first function typedef is a far pointer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, define a dummy typedef between the two typedefs
that will keep the argument count below 10.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in H2INC version 1.0 which is
included with MASM version 6.0. This problem was corrected in H2INC version 1.0
which is included with MASM version 6.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample header file below may be used to illustrate this problem. Garbage
characters will appear in the resulting .INC file.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Command line options needed: none
   */ 
   typedef void Func1Def(int, int, int, int, void _far *);
   // typedef void DummyFunc(int, int, int);  // Uncomment for workaround
   typedef void Func2Def(int, int, int, int, int);

   struct FuncStruct
   {
      int arg1;
      Func1Def * Func1;
      Func2Def * Func2;
   } FuncStruct;
