The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Attempting to run the DBASE.EXE file on a network either from a PIF, File
Manager, or directly from the Windows command line results in the following
Windows error message:

   Insufficient Memory To Run Application

This is caused by running DBASE.EXE rather than DBASE.COM on a network version of
dBASE IV versions 1.0 and 1.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DbASE IV can be installed specifically to run on a network that will allow for
multiple-user access. If dBASE IV is installed in this way, DBASE.COM is the
executable file that is created. If dBASE IV is not installed to run on a
network it will create a DBASE.EXE file that cannot be run off the network and
work correctly.

It is possible to run DBASE.EXE from within Windows 3.0 by executing it from the
MS-DOS command line under Windows or by creating a batch file that calls it.
However, this is not a recommended way to run dBASE IV on a network and is
unstable according to Ashton-Tate.
