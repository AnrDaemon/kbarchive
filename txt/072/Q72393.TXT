SUMMARY
=======

To install all of Microsoft Windows Resource Kit utilities, follow the procedure
in this article.

NOTE: You must install the Windows Resource Kit outside of Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Insert Windows Resource Kit disk 1 into your floppy disk drive.

2. From the MS-DOS prompt, switch to your Windows directory; for example, type

   cd \windows

3. Copy the KIT.BAT file from disk 1 to the Windows directory; for example,
   type

   copy kit.bat c:\windows

4. To run KIT.BAT, specify your Windows directory, your source drive, and your
   destination drive; for example, type:

   kit c:\windows a: c:

5. After the utilities are installed, the setup batch file installs the
   Productivity Pack for Windows.

6. After the Productivity Pack is installed, you can delete the PPTMP
   subdirectory that has been created by the Productivity Pack setup batch file.

The setup batch file installs these utilities into a WRKIT subdirectory under the
Windows directory. The program loads into the Windows subdirectory, regardless
of the drive and directory you specify as the destination drive. For example, if
you specify E: as the destination drive the program loads into C:\WINDOWS.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in The Windows Resource Kit. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
