Microsoft Windows uses installable device drivers for hardware-specific
support. In addition to the standard device entries in the SYSTEM.INI file,
Windows introduces another convention: the use of "driver specific"
parameters on the driver entry. For example, an entry in the SYSTEM.INI
file might look like the following:

   [mci]
   cdaudio=mcicda.drv
   waveaudio=mciwave.drv 4

The "waveaudio=" entry has both the driver name, MCIWAVE.DRV, and an
extra parameter that is specific to the MCI Wave driver (4). In this
example, "4" is the number of seconds of wave data the MCI Wave driver
buffers.

Because the driver can store the parameter on the same line of the
SYSTEM.INI file as the driver name, a new section of the SYSTEM.INI
file to store driver parameters is not required.

The user can change this parameter through the Drivers application in
the Control Panel by performing the following three steps:

1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Drivers icon

2. Select the MCI Wave driver

3. Choose the Setup button.
