The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can determine what programs and terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs)
are loaded into upper memory blocks (UMBs) by first using the EMM386 command to
see where UMBs start, and then using the MEM/DEBUG (or MEM/Program) command to
see how the UMBs are being used.

NOTE: This article applies to MS-DOS version 5.0; it does not apply to later
versions of MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you run EMM386.EXE from the command line, it displays something similar to
the following:

    MICROSOFT Expanded Memory Manager 386  Version 4.20.06X
   (C) Copyright Microsoft Corporation 1986, 1990

   Expanded memory services unavailable.

   Total upper memory available  . . . . . .     0 KB
   Largest Upper Memory Block available  . .     0 KB
   Upper memory starting address . . . . . .   C800 H

   EMM386 Active.

The "Upper memory starting address" is the first segment in which UMBs are
located.

Use MEM/DEBUG to show memory usage. It displays something similar to the
following (note: you can make the output stop after each page by using
MEM/DEBUG|MORE):

         3124224 bytes available XMS memory
                 MS-DOS resident in High Memory Area

Given the upper memory starting segment of C800, reported by EMM386, you can
examine the MEM/DEBUG output for any address greater than or equal to C8000.
Anything with "-- Free --" in the type column is available UMB memory. Anything
with a name other than MSDOS is a program or device driver that is running in a
UMB. In the example above, XNSBIOS, XNSBIOS, SESSION, PRTSC, DOSKEY, MIRROR,
MOUSE, RAMDRIVE, ANSI, SESSION, and REDIR are all running in UMBs.

The size is in Hexadecimal. In the example above, there are free UMBs at 0C8010
(size:130h) , 0C8150 (size:AE0h), 0D1AF0 (size:64E0h), and OEAD30 (size:52C0h).
If you are unfamiliar with Hex numbers, you can get a rough approximation of the
size of the block in K as follows:

   (Multiply 10,000 digit by 16) + (Multiply 1,000 digit by 4) + (Divide 100
   digit by 400) = K.

Thus, in the example above, the UMB at location OEAD30, size 52C0, is
(5*4)+(2/4)=20.5K.
