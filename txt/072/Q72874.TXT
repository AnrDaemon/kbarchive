SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft recommends that you DO NOT install for "No Network" if a
Windows-supported network is actually installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The VNETBIOS and DOSNET devices automatically detect if they are necessary, and
do not load if a network is not installed. They are always specified as a
default in case Windows is installed for No Network, but a network is actually
present.

A case in which this could occur is when Windows 3.0 is installed while the
network is not loaded. Windows Setup does not detect a network, so it installs
for No Network. When the network is later activated, VNETBIOS and DOSNET detect
the network presence and prevent compatibility problems. However, no network
functionality is present without a Windows network driver installed.
Additionally, the system cannot print through a network- redirected printer port
if Windows is not specifically installed for a network.
