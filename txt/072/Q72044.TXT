The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

If the error message "Access Denied" is given when you attempt to delete a file
that does not have the read-only bit set, check to see if you are running
Stacker.

MORE INFORMATION
================

STAC Electronics of Carlsbad, California, has released a disk compression
utility that creates logical drives and makes exact copies of the old drives in
them, except that everything except MSDOS.SYS, IO.SYS, COMMAND.COM, CONFIG.SYS,
and AUTOEXEC.BAT are compressed to save space.

It is possible for the "Stacker volume" (the logical drive that contains the
compressed files) to be marked as "read only". If this is the case, there is no
standard way from within MS-DOS to delete the file.

To see if the Stacker volume has been marked as "read only," reboot the computer
and look for the message:

   Volume Damage Read Only Write Protect
