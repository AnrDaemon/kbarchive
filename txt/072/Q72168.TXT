7. MAKING YOUR NETWORK COMPATIBLE WITH MS-DOS 5.0
-------------------------------------------------

7.1 MS-DOS Shell and Networks:

Most network software won't work correctly if you start it from a MS-DOS Shell
command prompt. Start your network before starting MS-DOS Shell.

7.2 AT&T StarGROUP:

If your AT&T StarGROUP version does not support MS-DOS 5.0, contact your
AT&T representative or the AT&T National Systems Support Hotline for
information about required modifications or upgrades.

7.3 PC-NFS 3.0:

If you use PC-NFS 3.0 with MS-DOS Shell, MS-DOS Shell may display more drives
than you have currently enabled. To prevent this, use the PC-NFS /d switch to
specify the number of drives you are using. For more information, see your
PC-NFS documentation.

If you can't use the COPY or XCOPY command on PC-NFS 3.01, contact your vendor to
get an updated version of the PCNFS.SYS device driver.

7.4 TOPS Network:

If your system is a TOPS workstation, the MS-DOS Shell MOVE command may not
work.

Don't use the LOADHIGH command with a TOPS network.
