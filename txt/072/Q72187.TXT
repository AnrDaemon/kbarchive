SUMMARY
=======

When attempting to delete a directory that has been made into a virtual drive,
using the SUBST command from MS-DOS Shell that came with MS-DOS versions 4.0,
4.01, 4.01a, and 5.0, you get the following message:

   System integrity violated. You should exit.

If the directory has been SUBSTed, the message itself is an error in Shell, and
you can continue working within the shell without having to exit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the error occurs when deleting a directory, do the following:

1. If you know for sure that the directory has been SUBSTed, the error can be
   ignored. However, the directory still needs to be unSUBSTed before it can be
   deleted. See step 2c.

2. If you are not sure if the directory has been SUBSTed, do the following:

   a. Exit Shell immediately.

   b. Type "SUBST" (without the quotation marks) at the command line. This will
      list all the SUBSTed directories.

   c. If the directory in question is present, it first has to be unSUBSTed
      before it can be deleted. Type "SUBST <DRIVE>:/D" (without the
      quotation marks) at the command line to unSUBST. You can now return to
      Shell and delete the directory.

   d. If the directory in question is not in the SUBST list, system integrity
      has indeed been violated, and you should immediately reboot your system.

This error occurs because the C-runtime sets _dos_errno to EBUSY, which Shell
cannot interpret. It, therefore, maps that error number to the message "System
Integrity Violated...".

There is an analogous error when trying to remove a SUBSTed directory from the
command line. The message is the following

   Attempt to remove current directory - <directory>

even though the directory is not your current directory. It is, however, the
current directory for the SUBSTed drive.

Additional query words: 4.00 4.01 4.01a 5.00
