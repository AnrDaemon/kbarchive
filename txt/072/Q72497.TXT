TITLE   :BUG: FatalExit() Interacts Through Terminal Only
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnokeyword

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under the debugging version of Windows, when a debugger is not in use and the
FatalExit() function interacts with the user, the interaction is through a
terminal connected to the AUX port and not through the console keyboard and a
secondary monitor if one is installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

In versions of Windows earlier than version 3.0, and in Windows 3.0 real mode,
the device driver OS.SYS can be installed to redirect information form FatalExit
() to a secondary monitor and the console keyboard. Under Windows 3.0 standard
and enhanced modes and under Windows 3.1 OX.SYS will only redirect output and
the console keyboard will not be redirected. After a FatalExit () call has
occured, the computer must be rebooted to regain control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a limitation of the Windows SDK versions 3.0
and 3.1.
