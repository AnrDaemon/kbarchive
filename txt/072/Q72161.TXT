NOTES ON MEMORY MANAGEMENT
--------------------------

4.1 Problems Loading into the Upper Memory Area
-----------------------------------------------

Some computers with hard disk controllers, specifically bus master DMA
controllers, may not be able to load device drivers or programs into the upper
memory area. Try adding a "DEVICE=SMARTDRV.SYS" (without the quotation marks)
command before any DEVICEHIGH commands in your CONFIG.SYS file.

4.2 Intel Expanded-Memory Driver (EMM.SYS)
------------------------------------------

Use the Intel expanded-memory driver NE or E switch when installing the driver
for Above Board. See your Above Board documentation for more information.

4.3 Phoenix BIOS and HIMEM.SYS
------------------------------

If your system includes a Phoenix BIOS and MS-DOS 5.0 doesn't work correctly, try
adding a "/machine:1" (without the quotation marks) or "/machine:8" (without the
quotation marks) switch to the DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS command in your CONFIG.SYS file.
