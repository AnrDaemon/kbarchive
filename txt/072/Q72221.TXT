SUMMARY
=======

When installing the Windows Resource Kit (WRK), the Setup program requires three
parameters. The target directory parameter of the Windows Resource Kit setup
procedure is used only by the Productivity Pack portion of the Setup program.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Resource Kit setup procedure requires three parameters:

 - Windows Setup location

 - Source drive

 - Target drive

If you specify a target drive other than the drive in which Windows resides, the
setup procedure adds a WRKIT and a PPTMP subdirectory to the Windows directory.

The Productivity Pack files are then installed into a PRODPACK directory on the
specified target drive.

If you want to install the Productivity Pack in a location other than the
location specified in the Resource Kit setup procedure, you will be prompted at
the beginning of the Productivity Pack portion of the setup and given the
opportunity to change the target location.
