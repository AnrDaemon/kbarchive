SUMMARY
=======

There is a file in the Microsoft Download Center called VERIFY.EXE that contains
sample code demonstrating the verification of the contents of a dialog box edit
control. The code reads and verifies the edit control string as each character
is entered by the user.

The contents of the edit control are verified to be legal for a specified data
type. If an illegal character is encountered, the character is removed from the
edit control and a message beep is generated. The code will verify the input of
WORD, DWORD, or FLOAT values.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

   Verify.exe
