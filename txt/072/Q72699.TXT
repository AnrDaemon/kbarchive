The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for MS-DOS, versions 1.01, 1.1, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 
 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for OS/2, versions 1.01, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.21 
 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for Windows NT, versions 1.4, 1.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to use NMAKE to process a makefile fails and NMAKE generates the
following message:

   fatal error U1033: syntax error : 'string' unexpected

The 'string' is some part of the makefile that NMAKE determines to be
syntactically incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

The makefile contains a line-continuation character (a backslash) and a
character other than a carriage return follows the backslash.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the makefile to remove any characters after the line continuation
character. NMAKE interprets the character that follows the backslash literally
and does not append the following line as desired. The U1033 error occurs
because the following line does not match NMAKE syntax by itself.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample makefile below illustrates this situation. NMAKE generates the
following message when it processes this makefile:

   fatal error U1033: syntax error : 'mod3.c' unexpected

Sample NMAKE Makefile
---------------------

   CFILES = mod1.c mod2.c \_
   mod3.c
