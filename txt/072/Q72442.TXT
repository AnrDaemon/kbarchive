SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience out of memory errors when running Aldus PageMaker version 4.0
with Microsoft Windows even if other large applications run without error.

CAUSE
=====

The most common reason for this problem is that the PageMaker installation
procedure did not correctly assemble PM4.EXE due to low disk space. At least 9
megabytes of hard disk space is needed to install PageMaker if you install all
the options.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, manually assemble the PM4.EXE file or reinstall
PageMaker.

To reinstall PageMaker, follow these steps:

1. Back up all PageMaker data files and delete PageMaker from the hard drive.

2. Make sure that the hard drive has at least 9 megabytes of available space and
   is optimized.

3. Start Windows in standard mode and install PageMaker. Starting Windows in
   standard mode ensures that a temporary swap file is not created; therefore,
   the maximum disk space will be available to PageMaker.
