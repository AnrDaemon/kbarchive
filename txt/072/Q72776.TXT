 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail workstation disk, named "Microsoft Mail", can be copied to an
AppleShare server to allow users to connect to the AppleShare server and run the
Mail workstation Installer.

To do this, copy the contents of the workstation disk to a folder named
"Microsoft Mail" on the AppleShare server. It is important that the folder be
named "Microsoft Mail", because the Installer script looks for a folder/disk
with this name. If the name of the folder is not "Microsoft Mail", the Installer
will ask you to insert the disk named "Microsoft Mail."

To automate the creation of this folder, drag the workstation disk icon to the
AppleShare server. The System software will automatically create the appropriate
folder titled "Microsoft Mail".

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has added this feature to meet the needs of large companies with many
workstations where installing the workstation software by disk can be a
difficult and time-consuming task.
