The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may experience erratic mouse movements if you run the MS-DOS 4.01 Dosshell
program (DOSSHELL.BAT) from within Microsoft Windows version 3.0. The mouse
driver used in the DOSSHELL.BAT file does not function properly under Windows.

To solve this problem, the mouse driver in DOSSHELL.BAT should be removed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Dosshell is a file management program supplied with MS-DOS version 4.01.
Dosshell provides an easy to use interface to MS-DOS. Files can be copied,
moved, renamed, and deleted without having to remember the MS-DOS commands.

The mouse driver used in DOSSHELL.BAT does not function properly under Windows.
To solve this problem, remove the driver from the "@SHELLC" line, and use
MOUSE.SYS (in CONFIG.SYS) or MOUSE.COM (in AUTOEXEC.BAT) instead.

The possible drivers used in DOSSHELL.BAT are:

   MOS:PCIBMDRV.MOS
   MOS:PCMSPDRV.MOS
   MOS:PCMSDRV.MOS

DOSSHELL.BAT can be found in the DOS directory. It can be edited with any text
editor, such as Edlin or Windows Notepad. Look for a line similar to the
following:

      @SHELLC MOS:PCIBMDRV.MOS/TRAN/COLOR/DOS/MENU/MUL/SND
         /MEU:SHELL.MEU/CLR:SHELL.CLR/PROMPT/MAINT/EXIT/SWAP/DATE

After removing the mouse driver, the line should be similar to the following:

      @SHELLC/TRAN/COLOR/DOS/MENU/MUL/SND/MEU:SHELL.MEU
         /CLR:SHELL.CLR/PROMPT/MAINT/EXIT/SWAP/DATE
