TITLE   :FIX: BIND Generates Multiply Defined Symbols with API.LIB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When binding an OS/2 protected mode application that was assembled or compiled
under compact or large memory model, it is necessary to specify the module
APILMR.OBJ on the BIND command line. Using the version of API.LIB included with
the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 package in conjunction with
APILMR.OBJ will result in the following error:

   API.LIB(i_apilmr.asm): error L2044: API_MEMREP: symbol multiply defined, use
   /NOE

Binding with the /NOE switch causes the error to be suppressed, but the program
will not work correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two workarounds for this error:

1. Delete I_APILMR.OBJ from API.LIB. This is done with the LIB utility as
   follows:

   LIB API.LIB-I_APILMR;

-or-

2. Replace I_APILMR.OBJ in API.LIB with the APILMR.OBJ from the MASM LIB
   subdirectory:

   LIB API.LIB-I_APILMR+APILMR;

   If APILMR.OBJ is replaced in API.LIB, it is no longer necessary to specify
   APILMR.OBJ on the BIND command line.

Note that both of these workarounds create a version of API.LIB that can only be
used when binding a compact or large model program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is necessary to BIND with the file APILMR.OBJ in order for programs compiled
under the large or compact memory model to correctly access the near heap. For
more information, see the online help index for BIND and select the link to
either APILMR.OBJ or Command Line Syntax.
