-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To operate properly, Super PC-Kwik version 4.0 by Multisoft Corporation requires
the following setting in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

      VirtualHDIRQ=False

MORE INFORMATION
================

Super PC-Kwik is a third-party disk-caching utility similar to Microsoft
SMARTDrive. Unlike SMARTDrive, which uses extended or expanded memory for its
cache buffers, Super PC-Kwik allows the cache buffers to be placed in extended,
expanded, and conventional memory through command-line switches.

Super PC-Kwik also contains command-line switches that allow for faster writing
to floppy and hard disk drives. This support is not available unless the
"VirtualHDIRQ=False" line is added to the SYSTEM.INI file.

PC-Kwik and SoundBlaster
------------------------

PC-Kwik may also exhibit some problems when working with SoundBlaster under
Microsoft Windows. Even if there isn't a physical IRQ conflict, SoundBlaster may
report that it cannot install successfully under Windows. Both PC-Kwik and
SoundBlaster will appear to function correctly under MS-DOS.

To work around this problem, edit the PCKWIK.INI file and change the following
settings:

      [pckspl]
      parallelints=no

This should allow SoundBlaster to work properly.
