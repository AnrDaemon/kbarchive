The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows

SUMMARY
=======

The AppActivate command activates the specified window in a program other than
Microsoft Word. Use AppActivate to switch to another program that is already
running or that you have started by using Shell. To activate a window within
Microsoft Word, use the Activate command.

NOTE: If the other program is minimized, the AppActivate command will not
maximize that program; it simply gives that program the focus and then returns
the focus to Word.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about switching focus to another program from Word 97 for
Windows, while in the Visual Basic for Applications Editor, click the Office
Assistant, type "AppActivate" (without the quotation marks), click Search, and
then click to view "AppActivate Statement". For examples of how to do this in
Word, click "Example."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
