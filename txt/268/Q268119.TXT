CD-ROM Cover: CD Key For Evaluation Software Is Incorrect
---------------------------------------------------------

You may receive the following error message when installing the Windows 2000
Server Evaluation Edition software that is included with this Training Kit:

   The CD key you entered is not valid.

If you have a copy of this Training Kit with a sticker on the CD cover and are
using the CD key printed on the sticker, you will need to verify that the last
five digits of the CD key are TY4D6.

If you have a copy of the Training Kit with the CD key printed on the back of the
CD cover, then the CD key is only 20-digits. The Windows 2000 Server Evaluation
Edition software requires a 25-digit CD key. In order to use the CD key you must
add the five digits, B3QHR, before the last group of characters. In other words,
the last ten digits of the CD key will be B3QHR-TY4D6.


Box Cover: Incorrect Minimum System Requirements
------------------------------------------------

The minimum system requirements listed on the bottom of the training kit box are
incorrect.

Change:
"64 MB RAM minimum; 128 MB RAM recommended"

To:
"128 MB RAM minimum"

Change:
"Note: To complete the exercises for Windows 2000 Server training, you will need
two computers each equipped with internal modems and the minimum configuration
above"

TO:
"Note: To complete the exercises for Windows 2000 Server training, you will need
two computers each equipped with internal modems, network interface cards and
the minimum configuration above. To complete the exercises for Windows 2000
Professional training, you will need a copy of the Windows 2000 Professional
operating system installed on one of the computers."
