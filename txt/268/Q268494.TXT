TITLE   :XFOR: Messages Stuck in Outbound Waiting Delivery Queue in IMS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running two Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) computers on
the same subnet in the same Exchange site, you may experience a problem if you
have the Internet Mail Service installed on both servers.

If both servers are connected to an Internet service provider over a T1 line, and
Server A is designated for inbound and outbound messages while Server B is set
for outbound messages only, Internet messages may stop in the outbound waiting
delivery queue in the Internet Mail Service (IMS) on Server B.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the routing table for the site has not been
updated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, update the routing table in the MTA on the server set
for outbound messages (Server B):

1. In Control Panel, double-click Services, and then stop the Internet Mail
   Service.

2. Start the Exchange Administrator program, expand the Configuration container,
   expand the Servers container, and then click Server B.

3. Open the Message Transfer Agent properties page, click the General tab, and
   then click Recalculate Routing.

4. Back up the Imcdata\Out directory, which is located in
   <DRIVE>:\Exchsrvr\Imcdata. Then delete all files in the Imcdata\Out
   directory.

5. In <DRIVE>:Exchsrvr\Imcdata\, delete the Queue.dat file.

6. In Control Panel, double-click Services, and then start the Internet Mail
   Service.

7. Send a test message to make sure that the message is delivered.

8. To recover messages, repeat Steps 3 through 5.
