======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) Service Manager may generate the following error
message if the currently logged-on user is a member of many domain local
groups:

CAUSE
=====

SMS Service Manager uses a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider
that is located on the site server to which the Service Manager console
connects. The WMI provider is responsible (among other things) for verifying
that the user who is running the Service Manager console is an administrator. If
the user is a member many domain local or computer local groups, the check for
Administrator local group membership may not succeed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
