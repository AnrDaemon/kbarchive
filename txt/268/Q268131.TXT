======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you specify a public folder as a contact of another public folder, a
quota-warning message may be delivered in English regardless of the locale of
the server. In other cases, it may deliver in a random language such as
Japanese, Cyrillic, Greek, and so on.

CAUSE
=====

Exchange Server delivers a quota-warning message with the language ID of a
contact for a public folder. When a public folder is specified as a contact of
another public folder, the language ID is not initialized.

By default, Exchange Server sends the message in English if the uninitialized
data is not valid as a language ID, or sends a message in a random language if
the uninitialized data is valid as language ID.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
