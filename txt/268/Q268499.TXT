TITLE   :SMS: Software Distribution Does Not Function on Alpha Platform
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Systems Management Server (SMS) Service Pack 2 (SP2), software
distribution may not work on Alpha-based computers that have the Network Monitor
Agent tool version 2 installed. The last entry that is reported in the the log
for the Smsapm32.exe tool is "Checking if a user is actually logged on." At this
point Smsapm32.exe quits silently.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by an issue with the Network Monitor Performance Counter
Nmperf.dll dynamic link library (DLL) file. This file causes the Smsapm32.exe
process to quit unexpectedly while it is attempting to determine if a user is
logged on. This behavior does not occur with earlier versions of SMS because the
process that Smsapm32.exe uses to determine if a user is logged on locally has
been modified.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, rename or remove the Nmperf.dll file from the
%SystemRoot%\System32 folder. This procedure removes the Network Segment
Performance Counter object, and therefore prevents Smsapm32.exe from quitting
unexpectedly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
