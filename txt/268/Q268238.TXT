TITLE   :SMS: Err Msg: Fatal Error. Setup Cannot Upgrade the SQL Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade to Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2),
the Setup procedure may stop halfway through the upgrade process, and you may
receive the following error message:

   Fatal error. Setup cannot upgrade the SQL database. Contact your SQL
   Administrator.

When this behavior occurs, the following error message is placed in the
Smssetup.log file:

   <07-13-1999 17:40:49> FAILED Sql Script: Creating indexes on
   StatusMessages
   <07-13-1999 17:40:49> SQL error <>

CAUSE
=====

The status message tables within the Microsoft SQL Server database may be too
large.

WORKAROUND
==========

Perform the following query in SQL Query Analyzer, focused on the SMS database,
to verify that the database has not been upgraded:

   "select SMSBuildNumber from smsdata"

If previous upgrade attempts did not complete the upgrade procedure for the
database, the output shows version 1380, which is the Service Pack 1 (SP1) build
number.

If you want to keep all of the existing status messages, use the steps in the
following sections. If you do not want to keep any of the existing status
messages, follow the steps in the "Truncate the Affected Tables so the Upgrade
Procedure Can Proceed" section.

How to Export Tables to an Alternate Database
---------------------------------------------

1. Quit all SMS services, and then quit and disable the Microsoft Windows
   Management service on the site server.

2. In SQL Enterprise Manager, click the SMS database, and then click the "Tables
   and Indexes" tab in the right pane in Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

3. Verify the number of rows and the table size for the StatusMessageAttributes,
   StatusMessageInsStrs, and StatusMessages tables.

   If there is an excessive number of rows in any of these three tables, start
   the SQL Enterprise Manager MMC snap-in.

4. Double-click the server name, double-click Databases, and then open the SMS
   database.

5. Click Tables, and then right-click the StatusMessageAttributes table.

6. Click All Tasks, click Export Data, and then click Next when the Data
   Transformation Services Export Wizard starts.

7. In the "Choose a Data Source" dialog box, click Next, and then click New in
   the Database list in the "Choose a Destination" dialog box.

8. In the Name box, type a temporary name, click OK, and then click Next.

9. In the "Specify Table Copy or Query" dialog box, click Next.

10. In the Select Source Tables dialog box, click to select the check boxes for
   the following tables, and then click Next:

   [<SMS database name>].[dbo].[StatusMessageAttributes]
   [<SMS database name>].[dbo].[StatusMessageInsStrs]
   [<SMS database name>].[dbo].[StatusMessages]

11. In the "Save, Schedule and Replicate Package" dialog box, verify that the
   "Run immediately" check box is selected, and then click Next.

12. In the "Completing the DTS Wizard" dialog box, click Next, and then click OK
   when the table-copying procedure is finished.

13. In the Executing DTS Package dialog box, click Done.

Truncate the Affected Tables so the Upgrade Procedure Can Proceed
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. In SQL Enterprise Manager, click the SMS database, and then click the "Tables
   and Indexes" tab in the right pane in MMC.

2. Verify the number of rows and the table size for the StatusMessageAttributes,
   StatusMessageInsStrs, and StatusMessages tables.

   If there is an excessive number of rows in any of these three tables, run the
   following queries in SQL Query Analyzer, focused on the SMS database:

   "TRUNCATE TABLE StatusMessageAttributes"
   "TRUNCATE TABLE StatusMessageInsStrs"
   "TRUNCATE TABLE StatusMessages"

You can now restart the SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) upgrade.
To verify the progress of the installation procedure, use the smstracer command
to monitor the Smssetup.log file.

When the installation procedure is finished, start the SMS Administrator console
to verify connectivity to the database.

Restore the Status Message Tables After the Upgrade Procedure
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Quit all SMS services, and then stop and disable the Windows Management
   service on the site server.

2. In SQL Enterprise Manager, click the SMS database, and then click the "Tables
   and Indexes" tab in the right pane in MMC.

3. Verify the number of rows and the table size for the StatusMessageAttributes,
   StatusMessageInsStrs, and StatusMessages tables.

   If there is an excessive number of rows in any of these three tables, start
   the SQL Enterprise Manager MMC snap-in.

4. Double-click the server name, double-click Databases, and then open the SMS
   database.

5. Click Tables, and then right-click the StatusMessageAttributes table.

6. Click All Tasks, click Import Data, and then click Next when the Data
   Transformation Services Import Wizard starts.

7. In the Database box, click the database name that you created in the "How to
   Export Tables to an Alternate Database" section of this article, and then
   click Next.

8. In the "Choose a Destination" dialog box, click Next, and then click Next in
   the "Specify Table Copy or Query" dialog box.

9. In the Select Source Tables dialog box, click Select All, and then click
   Next.

10. In the "Save, Schedule and Replicate Package" dialog box, verify that the
   "Run immediately" check box is selected, and then click Next.

11. In the "Completing the DTS Wizard" dialog box, click Finish.

12. When the table-copying procedure is finished, click OK, and then click Done
   in the Executing DTS Package dialog box.

You can now view status messages in the SMS Administrator console.

NOTE: If you want to permanently remove the status messages before you upgrade to
SMS 2.0 SP2, any status messages that had previously existed are removed from
the database tables and are not displayed in the SMS Administrator console. If
you click to select the Component Status check box, you can view all of the
status messages that are now removed. Because you did not change the
Summarizer_ComponentTallys table, the counts for error, information, and
warnings for the component remain. These counts are reset to the current
summarization tallies at the next 12:00 A.M. tally reset.
