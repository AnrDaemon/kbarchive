WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To make sure the necessary services are present in the registry, follow these
steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32).

2. Navigate to the following registry location:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Messenger

3. In the right pane of the Registry Editor window, double-click the value
   DependOnService.

4. In the Multi-String Editor dialog box, make sure the following services are
   listed under Data. Each service should be listed on a separate line:

   LanmanWorkstation
   NetBIOS

5. If either of these services is missing, type its name in the Data box, with
   each service on a separate line, and then click OK.

6. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.
