TITLE   :SMS: SMS 2.0 Clients Do Not Complete Installation Due to a Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbClient kbConfig kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running the Smsls.bat file during Logon Installation, the client does not
complete the installation process and no logs appear in the
%systemroot%\ms\sms\logs directory.

CAUSE
=====

In the Smsls.bat file, several calls are based on the TEMP environment variable.
If this variable is set to a path that has a space in it, then the attempt to
find and execute Slownet.exe in the SLOWNET section of the Smsls.bat file fails
due to a misinterpretation of the command line.

WORKAROUND
==========

Modify the TEMP environment variable on the desired System Management Server
(SMS) client workstation so it no longer has spaces in the path.

On a Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98 Computer
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Modify this variable within the Autoexec.bat file on the client.

2. The variable should be listed in a line similar to "SET TEMP" or "SET TMP."

3. Make sure that there is no space in the location, particularly any trailing
   spaces.

On a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
-----------------------------------------

1. Right-click the My Computer icon on the desktop, and then click Properties.

2. On the Environment tab, under the "User Variables for Administrator", locate
   either the TEMP, or the TMP variable (both may exist).

3. Select the TEMP or TMP variable next to Value.

4. Make sure that there is no space in the location, particularly any trailing
   spaces.

On a Microsoft Windows 2000 Computer
------------------------------------

1. Right-click the My Computer icon on the desktop, and then click Properties.

2. On the Advanced tab, click Environment Variables.

3. Under the "User Variables for Administrator", locate either the TEMP, or the
   TMP variable (both may exist).

4. Select the TEMP or TMP variable, and then click Edit.

5. Make sure that there is no space in the location, particularly any trailing
   spaces.

======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
