SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Mailbox Manager to clean a container with a hidden mailbox that has a
space at the end of the directory name, Mailbox Manager may Access Violate. The
DrWatson.log contains the following stack, if symbols are properly installed:

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because Mailbox Manager builds a list of mailboxes to send
to the directory to be resolved. This resolution process strips the trailing
spaces so the names can be resolved against the directory by using ambiguous
name resolution, which causes the name lookup to fail and not populate the list
with the required Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) properties.
When the directory returns this list to Mailbox Manager, Mailbox Manager does
not check the list to determine whether all of the name lookups were successful.
When Mailbox Manager attempts to gain access to an item in the list that was not
successfully resolved, Mailbox Manager stops responding.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
