TITLE   :Cannot Map to Drive Z if Novell Client32 Is Not Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:; Win2000:95; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows 95 and Windows 98, drive Z is not mapped when you use a Windows NT
logon script. However, if Novell Client32 is installed, drive Z successfully
maps when you use a Windows NT logon script.

CAUSE
=====

When a Windows 95- or Windows 98-based computer logs on to a Windows NT 4.0
domain, the NetLogon share used to log on is mapped to drive Z. Thus, the
universal naming convention (UNC) sharename is Z:\<Servername>\Netlogon.
NetWare Client configures the Windows NT logon script to use drive Y instead of
drive Z. Therefore, drive Z cannot be used. Novell typically uses drive Z as a
search drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the directory that you want the log on to be mapped to, and then
   click "Map network drive".

2. Ensure that the "Reconnect at Logon" check box is selected.

3. Type Z as the letter of the drive.

This process takes place after the NetLogon pipe has closed, and drive Z becomes
available.

To work around this issue, you can migrate to a Windows NT or a Windows 2000
workstation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The steps to resolve this issue that are listed in the section above need to be
done annually for all users who wish to reconnect to a mapped drive Z when they
log on. Note that this configuration is part of the user's profile and is mapped
for each user (not for each computer).
