======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SELECT - SQL command may return .NULL. records in a left-outer join when you
filter the child table for EMPTY() records. This is not the way that SQL Server
handles identical data and statements.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to filter on the child table and only see matching records, you
should use an INNER JOIN. However, if you want to see all parent records but
only those children that match the filter, you should include the filter
condition in the JOIN clause. For more information, see the Microsoft Knowledge
Base article in the "References" section to follow.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code in Visual FoxPro:

   CREATE TABLE PTable ( PKey C(5), ID_Field_p C(5) )

   ** Create the child table.
   CREATE TABLE CTable ( PKey C(5), ID_Field_c C(5), TestField C(5) )

   ** Insert records into the parent table.
   INSERT INTO PTable VALUES ( "00001", "prec1" )
   INSERT INTO PTable VALUES ( "00002", "prec2" )
   INSERT INTO PTable VALUES ( "00003", "prec3" )
   INSERT INTO PTable VALUES ( "00004", "prec4" )
   INSERT INTO PTable VALUES ( "00005", "prec5" )

   ** Insert records into the child table.
   ** Note that parent record two has two children, and
   **  parent record three has no children.
   INSERT INTO CTable VALUES ( "00001", "crec1", "ONE" )
   INSERT INTO CTable VALUES ( "00002", "crec2", "" )
   INSERT INTO CTable VALUES ( "00002", "crec3", "TWO" )
   INSERT INTO CTable VALUES ( "00004", "crec4", "THREE" )
   INSERT INTO CTable VALUES ( "00005", "crec5", "" )

   SELECT * ;
      FROM PTable ;
      LEFT OUTER JOIN CTable ON PTable.PKey == CTable.PKey ;
      WHERE CTable.TestField = "     "

This should only match parent records 2 and 5. Because parent record 3 has no
children, it should not be returned.

2. Run the following code in the SQL Server Query Analyzer for comparison:

   CREATE TABLE PTable ( PKey Char(5), ID_Field_p Char(5) )

   CREATE TABLE CTable ( PKey Char(5), ID_Field_c Char(5), TestField Char(5) )

   INSERT INTO PTable VALUES ( "00001", "prec1" )
   INSERT INTO PTable VALUES ( "00002", "prec2" )
   INSERT INTO PTable VALUES ( "00003", "prec3" )
   INSERT INTO PTable VALUES ( "00004", "prec4" )
   INSERT INTO PTable VALUES ( "00005", "prec5" )

   INSERT INTO CTable VALUES ( "00001", "crec1", "ONE" )
   INSERT INTO CTable VALUES ( "00002", "crec2", "" )
   INSERT INTO CTable VALUES ( "00002", "crec3", "TWO" )
   INSERT INTO CTable VALUES ( "00004", "crec4", "THREE" )
   INSERT INTO CTable VALUES ( "00005", "crec5", "" )

   SELECT * 
      FROM PTable 
      LEFT OUTER JOIN CTable ON PTable.PKey = CTable.PKey
      WHERE CTable.TestField = "     "
