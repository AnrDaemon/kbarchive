TITLE   :XADM: Exchange 5.5 Server from Select CD Limits IS to 16 GB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Exchange Server 5.5 from the Microsoft Select CD,
using AutoRun from the Setup.exe program file, Exchange Server may alert you
that the 16-gigabyte (GB) database limit is reached.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur when you install the Standard Edition of Exchange Server
5.5. The information store databases (Priv.edb and Pub.edb) in this version are
limited to 16 GB each. After the limit is reached, the Exchange Server database
engine stops taking transactions and notifies the information store to shut
down.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, run the SrvRmax.exe program file from the Select CD to
install the Enterprise Edition of Exchange Server 5.5. The Enterprise Edition
information store databases are limited only by available hardware resources.
