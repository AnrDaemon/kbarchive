PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool kbServer kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a site reset, you may receive the following error message:

   Either the password for service account <master domain
   name>\<account name> is incorrect or administrator accounts in
   domain <master domain name> do not have administrator privileges in
   domain <resource domain name>.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if any of the following conditions exist:

 - You are not using the correct password.

 - The specified account does not have administrative rights on the computer.

 - The specified account has been configured to only log on to certain
   workstations and the site server is not included in the list of authorized
   workstations.

 - Systems Management Server (SMS) Site server is in a resource domain and the
   SMS service account is in the master domain.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Verify that the password is correct.

2. Verify that the service account is a member of domain administrators or is a
   member of the local administrators group in User Manager for Domains.

3. Verify that the "User May Log Onto All Workstations" feature is enabled in
   User Manager for Domains.

NOTE: In a master domain model, user accounts are normally maintained in the
master domain. By default, SMS does not place a master domain account in the
resource domain local administrators group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

are used by SMS 2.0, view the SMS Security Whitepaper at the following Microsoft
