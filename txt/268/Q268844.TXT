SUMMARY
=======

LINKCFG is a command line utility that lets you install the SNA Server Link
Services, such as the DLC 802.2 Link Service, the Distributed Link Service
(DLS), and the DEMO Link Service, and so on. You can use Linkcfg.exe to remove
an existing link service. This feature is included in SNA Server 3.0 Service
Pack 2 (SP2) and later and in SNA Server 4.0 and later. Currently, the LINKCFG
command-line Help does not document the /DELETE switch.

NOTE: Before you use the LINKCFG delete switch, use the Snacfg.exe command line
utility to remove the existing link service entry from the SNA Server
Configuration (Com.cfg) file, and then proceed to delete the link service with
LINKCFG.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, to delete an existing SNA Server Link Service, such as the DLC
802.2 Link Service, use the following command line syntax at the command
prompt:

   

   SNACFG #[path to configuration file] LINK [Server Name]:SnaDlc1 /DELETE

When you have successfully removed the link service entry from the configuration,
proceed to the next command as follows:

   

   LINKCFG LINKSVC "DLC 802.2 Link Service #1" /SERVER:[Server Name] /LSTYPE:"DLC 802.2 Link Service" /DELETE

You can use combinations of SNACFG and LINKCFG in a command line batch file to
remove an existing link service, create a new link service, and then re-assign
the existing connection to the new link service. For example:

   

   REM ----Delete the previous link service------
   SNACFG #[path to configuration file] link "Server Name":SnaDlc1 /DELETE (without the quotation marks)

   LINKCFG LINKSVC "DLC 802.2 Link Service #1" /SERVER:[Server Name] /LSTYPE:"DLC 802.2 Link Service" /DELETE

   REM ----Add the new link service------
   LINKCFG LINKSVC "Created by Linkcnfg.exe" /SERVER:[Server Name] /LSTYPE:"DLC 802.2 Link Service" /ADAPTERTYPE:EL901X /DISTRIBUTABLE:NO /USEFIXEDSAP:NO

   REM ----Configure the link service for the existing connection------
   SNACFG #[path to configuration file] link "Server Name":SnaDlc1 /ADD /LINKTYPE:Ether (without the quotation marks)
   SNACFG #[path to configuration file] connection "Connection Name" /LINKSERVICE:SnaDlc1 (without the quotation marks)
