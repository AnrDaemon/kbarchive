TITLE   :XWEB: Contact Created in OWA Can't Be Added As Recipient in OL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 3 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a personal contact in your Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA)
mailbox, and then you log off of OWA and on to your Microsoft Outlook Messaging
Application Programming Interface (MAPI) client, you are unable to add the
newly-created contact as a recipient to an e-mail message by clicking the To:
button and choosing the contact from the contact address list.

CAUSE
=====

The automatic Check Name function in the Outlook MAPI client is not available in
OWA. Therefore, when you save a new contact in OWA, the e-mail address does not
resolve and the behavior in the "Symptoms" section of this article occurs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, you can use either of the following methods:

Method 1:

Create contacts in the Outlook client instead of in OWA.

Method 2:

To resolve this behavior on a per-contact basis, open the contact created in OWA
by opening the contacts folder, selecting the contact, and then making and
saving any changes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
