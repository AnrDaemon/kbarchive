SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a the map and directions for a route that you created in
Microsoft Expedia Streets and Trips 2000, the directions are printed, but when
the printer prints the map, you may experience one of the following symptoms:

 - The printer may print a blank page instead of the map.

 - The printer may stop responding (hang).

If you print the directions and the map separately, the directions and the map
are printed successfully.

 - You run Streets and Trips 2000 on a Microsoft Windows 98-based computer.

 - The Unidrv.dll file on the computer is missing or damaged.

1. Insert the Windows 98 CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive. Press and hold down the
   SHIFT key when you insert the CD-ROM to prevent the CD-ROM from starting
   automatically.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type "sfc.exe" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

4. Click "Extract one file from installation disk."

5. In the "Specify the system file you would like to restore" box, type
   "unidrv.dll" (without the quotation marks), and then click Start.

6. In the Restore From box, click the CD-ROM drive that contains the Windows 98
   CD-ROM.

7. In the Save File In box, type the following line, and then click OK

   <drive>:\windows\system
