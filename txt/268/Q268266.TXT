======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A TN3270 print session may stop responding when it receives a SHUTD (shutdown)
command if the host terminates the bracket by sending a null RU with the EB (end
bracket) flag set.

CAUSE
=====

A null RU that is sent by the host to a TN3270E printer session is never
received, and then managed by the TN3270E printer. This problem occurs because
of a behavior that was introduced in a workaround to a bug contained in some
third-party emulators. A null RU is directly acknowledged by the TN3270 service,
and if it is included in this frame, the EB information is never sent to the
emulator. For this reason, the TN3270E session remains in a PENDBB (pending
between bracket) status and never goes into a BETB (between bracket) status. In
this condition, a SHUTD (shutdown) request coming from the host is never
accepted, as the TN3270E session is still waiting for the end of the bracket.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.
