-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cluster Server, versions 1.0, 1.1, used with:
    - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
    - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ClusterResourceControl function may leak a multiple of 4K of memory when
called. This only occurs when the CLUSCTL_RESOURCE_STORAGE_GET_DISK_INFO control
code is used to query a disk on one node if at least one disk is present on the
other node. The leak occurs in System nonpaged pool memory. The amount of memory
that is leaked is dependent on the number of shared disks that are not currently
owned by the target node.

CAUSE
=====

The ClusterResourceControl API calls the DeviceIOControl function and then
enumerates a list of shared disks attached to the system. If a shared disk is
encountered that is not owned by that node, then an error code is returned but
the memory that is allocated from DeviceIOControl is not freed.

See the "References" section of this article for information about a similar bug.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems

testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains
this fix.
