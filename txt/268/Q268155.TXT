======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a NetBIOS name query on a computer, the query may be slow or
may not work. This may cause you program or session to time out on the client
computer.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the following conditions exist:

 - You are trying to resolve a NetBIOS name.

 - The name exists in a different domain that the domain in which the querying
   computer is located.

 - Multiple domain-suffix search-order entries are specified in TCP/IP
   properties.

For example, assume that you are trying to ping a computer named Remote in the
<Name1>.com domain and that your computer is located in the
<Name2>.com domain. Windows attempts to resolve the NetBIOS name in the
<Name2>.com domain only. Windows may then later be able to resolve the
name when it queries the <Name1>.com domain by using the fully qualified
domain name (FQDN); this may occur up to a few minutes after you start the
query.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, download and install the Winsock 2 update for Windows 95.
