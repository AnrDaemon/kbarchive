TITLE   :XADM: Directory Import Fails When You Use a Command Line
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Directory Import on the Tools menu in the Microsoft Exchange
Server Administrator program, you can create or modify Exchange Server directory
objects. You can also use the following command line to create and modify
Exchange Server directory objects, where <options file> is the file that
you used to specify options that are similar to the options that are specified
in the Directory Import dialog box:

   admin /i <import file> /d <directory server name> /n /o
   <options file>

However, when you run this command, the import procedure may create or modify
objects in a container other than the default Recipients container.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you are using an improperly formatted options file or
you did not specify the correct Recipients container.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, check the options file that is specified in the
command-line syntax to ensure that the file is properly formatted. The options
file must contain an [Import] section, or the information in the options file is
not read during the import procedure. The default Recipients container is used
unless you specify otherwise. If you specify a different container, you must use
the relative distinguished name of the container where changes are to be made.

For example, to import data into a container called "SubContainer1" that is
located in the Recipients container, the options file must contain the following
information:

   [Options]
   Container=Recipients/Cn=Subcontainer1

To import data into a container called "OtherTopLevelContainer", the options file
must contain the following information:

   [Options]
   Container=OtherTopLevelContainer
