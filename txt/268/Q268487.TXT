SYMPTOMS
========

When a user logs on to a computer for the first time, the user's desktop may not
be the default desktop. For example, icons may not be displayed and programs may
be missing.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the default user profile was modified or
overwritten by an unknown event. The computer system has transferred policy
settings to the user's profile, even though a policy may not be in place. The
existing user profiles, however, are unaffected by these policy settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, restore the default user profile by means of your
backup system or from a copy of the same version of Microsoft Windows.
