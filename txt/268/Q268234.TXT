 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000

SUMMARY
=======

As documented in the Readme file of both SNA Server and Host Integration Server
2000, the minimum host requirements required to use the COM Transaction
Integrator component are as follows:

 - MVS with either CICS version 3.3 or IMS 4.0 or later and MVS APPC. IMS
   version 6.0 or later must be used for atomic transactions.

 - VSE V2.1.0 and CICS 2.1.0 or later.

 - TCP/IP V3R2 or later if TCP/IP is used .

IBM has since changed the names and version numbers of some of these core host
systems, which can lead to questions on whether or not a host system meets the
minimum requirements for COMTI.

Specifically, MVS has been renamed to OS/390, and CICS has been renamed to CICS
TS (Transaction Server). The version numbers have also been changed, so it is
possible to have a version number that is smaller than the version numbers in
the preceding minimum requirements list. Because these products are actually
newer than the minimum requirements, all versions of OS/390 and CICS TS meet the
minimum requirements for COMTI, and are considered supported environments.
