TITLE   :CDO MAPI Session Logon Fails If No Thread Token
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::1.2,1.21,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Collaboration Data Objects (CDO), versions 1.2, 1.21, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On Windows 2000, when an ActiveX EXE using CDO 1.2x creates a MAPI Session
object and then calls the Logon method, the Logon method can return
MAPI_E_LOGON_FAILED when the ActiveX EXE's identity is configured (under
DCOMCNFG) to run under a specific user. If the ActiveX EXE is configured to run
under the "interactive user" then it works fine and the Logon succeeds. The
exact same application runs properly on a Windows NT 4.0 server.

CAUSE
=====

A MAPI Session Logon call from a thread needs the ThreadToken set.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4.
