======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Age of Empires II Expansion: The Conquerors, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to host an Internet multiplayer game of Microsoft Age of
Empires II Expansion: The Conquerors, other players may be unable to join the
game.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if more than one network interface card is installed in
your computer.

When you click IP Address on the Multiplayer Game screen in Age of Empires II
Expansion: The Conquerors, the game may report an incorrect IP address.

RESOLUTION
==========

If your guest players are unable to use this IP address to connect to your game,
use the IP Configuration tool included with Microsoft Windows to determine the
IP address for the network interface card that you want to use for the game.

To do this:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "winipcfg" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click OK.

3. In the unlabeled box, click the network interface card that you want to use
   to host the game.

   NOTE: If you want to use a dial-up Internet connection to host the game, click
   PPP Adapter.

4. In the IP Address box, note the IP address for the network interface card,
   and then click OK.

5. Provide the IP address that you noted in step 4 to your guest players.

The guest players should now be able to connect to the game that you are hosting.
