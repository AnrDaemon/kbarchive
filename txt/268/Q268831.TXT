   Event ID: 1025

   Source: MSExchangeIS Private
   Type: Warning
   Category: General
   Description: An error occurred.
   Function name or description of problem: EcGenerateReadReport:
   Error 0xfffff9bb

CAUSE
=====

This warning is generated when the information store tries to create a record
that has a non-unique key. The information store tries again with another key
that is unique, and the write operation succeeds.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run Isinteg.exe from the post-Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 (SP3)
information store hotfix or later. See the "More Information" section for
version information.

The syntax for Exchange Server 5.5 is:

   "isinteg -pri -fix -test alltests" (without the quotation marks)

The syntax for Exchange 2000 Server is:

   "isinteg -s servername -fix -test alltests" (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

The warning in the "Symptoms" section is not an indication of a failed operation
or loss of functionality. The store recovers gracefully from the condition. If
you perform the instructions in the "Resolution" section, you can prevent the
condition that leads to the Application log warnings.

The post-SP3 store hotfix resolves a number of issues that can cause 1025 Events
in the EcGenerateNRN and EcGenerateReadReport functions. The hotfix includes a
new version of Isinteg.exe that can fix the apparent problem that generates the
events listed in the "Symptoms" section.

The updated files include the following files and versions:

+----------------------------+
| File name   | File version | 
+----------------------------+
| Store.exe   | 5.5.2652.42  | 
+----------------------------+
| Isinteg.exe | 5.5.2652.33  | 
+----------------------------+

Note that the 1025 Event is a generic warning event, and that this article only
applies if the function name and error code match.
