TITLE   :Access Violation in Cmd.exe Calling CreateProcess()

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Parent programs that spawn a child program pass an environment block to the
spawned child. In cases in which an extremely long path (more than 1,900 bytes)
exists in the parent environment, an access violation may occur during the
startup of a child process. For example, this might occur when a Setup program
(as a parent) starts another program as a child process.

The actual supported length for a path statement is 1,024 characters. Typically,
a "Path too long" error message is generated when the path exceeds approximately
1,900 bytes. However, an extremely long path (more than 1,024 bytes but less
than the amount that triggers the "Path too long" error message) may still
generate an error message when a child process is spawned.

As the parent spawns a child process (calling CreateProcess), a new Cmd.exe
session is started and some expansion of the inherited environment block occurs.
The following error message may occur when the new environment block is
initialized for the child process:

   Cmd.exe - Application Error

   The instruction at "0x77f64bab" referenced memory at "0x0067006f". The memory
   could not be "written".
   Click on OK to terminate the application.

CAUSE
=====

An incorrect initialization of a buffer is occurring.
