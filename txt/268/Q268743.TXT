TITLE   :PRB: Passing DeviceObject to HalAssignSlotResources Is Mandatory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Driver Development Kit (DDK) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

HalAssignSlotResources returns STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_3 if the DeviceObject
parameter is NULL.

CAUSE
=====

HalAssignSlotResources is obsolete and is exported only to support existing
drivers. Drivers of Plug and Play (PnP) devices are assigned resources by the
PnP Manager, which passes resource lists with each IRP_MN_START_DEVICE request.

On a computer running Windows 2000, all the bus-related hardware abstraction
layer (HAL) functions are patched to call the actual bus driver. Because the bus
driver tracks resources on a PDO basis, the system needs a device object to
simulate (fake) a PDO.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must specify a device object when you use HalAssignSlotResources.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
