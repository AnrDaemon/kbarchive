TITLE   :Netscape Groups Are Not Discovered in MMS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Netscape Management Agent (MA) does not discover groups that are created
directly from Netscape Server version 4.1 by using the Netscape console.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because by default, the object class from groups is Top and
"groupofuniquenames". In "Advanced Discovery Parameters", the "Requested object
classes for lists discovery" is only set to "groupOfNames". Because of this
class name difference, Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) discovery is
unable to retrieve some native Netscape lists.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, upgrade to MMS version 2.2. This issue is resolved in MMS
2.2.

To work around this issue:

1. Right-click Netscape MA, and then click Action.

2. Click Configure MA.

3. Click the Advanced Discovery Parameters tab.

4. In the "Requested object classes for lists discovery" box, add
   groupofuniquenames.

STATUS
======

listed at the beginning of this article.
