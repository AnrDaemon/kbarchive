TITLE   :Groups Exported to Netscape from MMS Are Not Searchable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1,2.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, versions 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Groups objects are exported to the Netscape connected directory. When there is a
search for one of the exported groups, the search fails. However, there are no
errors returned in the Zscript.log file on the Microsoft Metadirectory Services
(MMS) server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because GroupOfNames is a valid object class, but
GroupOfUniqueNames is the correct object class for groups in Netscape 4.1.
Because GroupOfNames is not the correct object class for groups in Netscape 4.1,
the objects are not considered a group and the search for group objects does not
render that group.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, change this object class value for new accounts:

1. Right-click Netscape MA and select Action.

2. Select Configure MA.

3. Click the New Accounts tab.

4. In the "Create Netscape groups using" box, change GroupOfNames to
   GroupOfUniqueNames.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
