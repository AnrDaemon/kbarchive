TITLE   :'Unable to Initialize KRNL32.EXE' Error Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Internet Explorer 4.1 on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, after you install the Windows NT 4.0 Option
Pack, the following error message may appear:

   MDM.EXE - Unable to Initialize KRNL32.EXE

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack is not supported on the
Terminal Server Edition of Windows NT 4.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use Internet Information Server 3.0, which comes
with Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, for Web server
functionality on the Terminal Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack is not supported because neither Internet Information
Server 4.0 nor Microsoft Transaction Server functions correctly when installed
on a computer running Terminal Server. Customer applications that require these
Option Pack technologies may not function properly either when they are
installed on Terminal Server.

Site Server also is not supported on Terminal Server.

The error message states that Machine Debug Manager (Mdm.exe), which is used by
the Microsoft Visual Studio in Internet Explorer to debug ActiveX scripts, is
not working. Because the script debugging tool is not supported with Terminal
Server, it should not be installed. If you did install it, follow these steps to
remove it:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

2. Click Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, and then click Add/Remove.

3. Within the setup program, click Machine Debug Manager to uninstall it.
