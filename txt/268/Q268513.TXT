PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install a 3Com 3C575-TX CardBus network interface card (NIC),
using the Have Diskette option from the Network tool in Control Panel, you may
receive the following error message:

   Missing OEMNT.inf or OEMSETUP.inf file

This happens when you have downloaded the 3c575x.exe file from the 3Com Web site,
saved it to a floppy disk, and then run the .exe file, creating several folders
and saved files on the disk.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because some of the files are not extracted when you run
the .exe file from the floppy disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, copy the 3c575x.exe file to the \Winnt folder and then
run it from there. The files should be extracted properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 3Com 3C575-TX CardBus NIC can be installed only on a computer that supports
CardBus; it should not be installed on a computer that supports only PC Card
mode (PCIC). On a computer that supports PCIC only, use the 3C574-TX NIC, which
is designed for PC Card interfaces running in 16-bit PC Card mode.
