======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Applications that are configured to use the Single Sign-On (SSO) feature may
fail to connect to a host system if the host security domain (HSD) was created
through the use of SNACFG.exe. The specific symptoms of the problem will depend
upon the application, but the errors will indicate a logon failure because the
user credentials forwarded to the host system will be incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

An internal configuration record that associates a host security domain to its
assigned host connection is not updated when you add an HSD by using SNACFG.exe.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create the Host Security Domain by using the Host Security Domain Configuration
Wizard in SNA Manager.

STATUS
======

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack (SP)
3, 4.0 SP4.


Host Integration Server 2000
----------------------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration Server
2000.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When a Host Security Domain is created it must be associated with a host
connection for the host security features to function correctly.

The ability to create host security domains by using SNACFG.exe was added in SNA
Server 4.0 SP3. The following Microsoft Knowledge Base article explains the
functionality that was added:

   Q236847 SNACFG Should Allow Configuration of Host Security Domains

When you are using SNACFG.exe to create an HSD, the /INSERTCONN: parameter is
used to specify the names of the host connections that are to be assigned to the
HSD.
