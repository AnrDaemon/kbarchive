SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure the IIS FTP server for FTP
authentication and how to automatically use the domain user database rather than
your local user accounts database, so that your users can access FTP folders by
using their familiar login without having to explicitly specify their domain
information.

MORE INFORMATION
----------------

NOTE: These procedures are designed to assist Web server administrators that host
FTP sites that require users to use their domain user name and password to
access their FTP folders. If you follow the procedures outlined in this article,
you will affect public access to FTP sites. Therefore, you should not use these
procedures if you are hosting public FTP sites.

Important Warning: FTP passwords are sent over networks in "clear text" and are
therefore easily stolen, especially on the Internet. For this reason, many
administrators set up FTP sites for anonymous read-only access, and use file
sharing if local network write access is needed or use the FrontPage Server
Extensions for Internet publishing.

Disable Anonymous FTP Access in IIS 5.0
---------------------------------------

When you disable Anonymous FTP access, users must always enter a valid user name
and password when they access your FTP site. (This configuration is more secure
when you allow users to upload files to your server.)

1. Open the Internet Services Manager. To do this, follow the steps for your
   version of IIS:

    - For IIS 4.0:

      a. On the Start menu, point to Programs, and then click Windows NT 4.0
         Option Pack.

      b. Click Microsoft Internet Information Server, and then click Internet
         Service Manager.

    - For IIS 5.0:

      a. On the Start menu, point to Programs, and then click Administrative
         Tools.

      b. Click Internet Services Manager.

2. In the console tree, right-click the FTP site that you want to configure, and
   then click Properties.

3. On the Security Accounts tab, click to uncheck the Allow Anonymous
   Connections check box.

4. Click Yes if you are prompted to continue.

5. Click OK.

Modify the DefaultLogonDomain in the IIS Metabase
-------------------------------------------------

When you specify the DefaultLogonDomain domain in your IIS settings, users are
not required to enter their domain name with their user name (for example,
<MYDOMAIN\MyUserName>) when logging in to your FTP site. If your FTP
server is a member server, and the user accounts are in the local security
database, this task is not necessary.

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open: text box, type "cmd " (without the quotation marks).

3. At the command prompt, type the following for your version of IIS:

    - For IIS 4.0, type:

   "cd /d %windir%\system32\inetsrv\adminsamples
   cscript adsutil.vbs set msftpsvc/DefaultLogonDomain <domain_name>"
   (without the quotation marks)

    - For IIS 5.0, type:

   "cd /d %systemdrive%\inetpub\adminscripts
   cscript adsutil.vbs set msftpsvc/DefaultLogonDomain <domain_name>"
   (without the quotation marks)

   For < domain_name>, type the name of your domain.

4. Type "exit" (without the quotation marks) to close the command prompt dialog
   box.
