======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Microsoft Windows 2000-based system, you may experience errors when you
attempt to open files that reside on a file share that was created by the
Microsoft SNA Server Shared Folders Gateway.

For example, if you use Notepad to access a text (.txt) file by using the
Universal Naming Convention (UNC) as follows

   \\<server name\share name\path\file name>.txt

you may receive the following error message:

   "Cannot open the \\<server name\share name>\test.txt file. Make sure a
   disk is in the drive you specified."

CAUSE
=====

In certain situations, Windows 2000 generates a FileInternalInformation request
when programs access files, and this request is then sent to the file server.

The Shared Folders Gateway in Microsoft SNA Server does not support the
FileInternalInformation information request type and returns an Invalid
Parameter response to the client system.

RESOLUTION
==========

correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
