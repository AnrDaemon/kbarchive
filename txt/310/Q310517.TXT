======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Host-initiated password changes are not replicated to the Windows NT or Windows
2000 accounts database when you are using the password synchronization feature
that is included with Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000. The HIS 2000 host
security components will log event 1301 messages similar to the following when
this problem occurs:

   Event ID: 1301
   Source: SNA Host Security
   Description: The database received a request it did not understand Supplied
   code %1

   Event ID: 1301
   Source: SNA Host Security
   Description: The database received a request it did not understand Supplied
   code, send UdiChPwdRq to Mdb <Windows NT/2000 domain name> failed

   Event ID: 1301
   Source: SNA Host Security
   Description: The database received a request it did not understand Supplied
   code, HprReplicatedUpdate Failed <Host Security domain name>

   Event ID: 1301
   Source: SNA Host Security
   Description: The database received a request it did not understand Supplied
   code, HPR_CHANGE_PASSWORD_REQUEST

NOTE: The event 1301 messages will be logged in the Application Event Log on the
Windows NT 4.0 Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or Windows 2000 PDC emulator
where the SNA Host Account Cache and SNA WinNT Account Synchronization services
are installed.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Host Account Cache (SnaDatabase) service fails to obtain the Windows NT
or Windows 2000 domain name prior to validating the length of the domain name.
This results in the event 1301 messages and the failure to update the user's
Windows NT or Windows 2000 password.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services

update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The HIS 2000 Host Security Integration feature supports one-way host-initiated
password synchronization to IBM mainframes and AS/400s. Environments that
perform host-initiated password synchronizations require a third-party password
synchronization application in addition to the HIS 2000 Host Security
Integration components.

The following Knowledge Base article describes another problem that can occur
with host-initiated password changes when using HIS 2000:
