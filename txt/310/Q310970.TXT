TITLE   :PRB: Some Intellisense Settings Do Not Persist Between Sessions
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbvfp700

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set the _VFP.EditorOptions property, either in code or through the
Intellisense Manager, and then quit Visual FoxPro 7, the value is not saved when
you start Visual FoxPro again.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a configuration file (usually Config.fpw) to persist the setting.

   MODIFY FILE HOME() + "config.fpw"

Add the following line, modifying as appropriate:

   COMMAND=_VFP.EditorOptions = "lqkT"

See the "EditorOptions" Help topic for the options you can set here.

You can only have one COMMAND line in your Config.fpw file. If you need more than
one, create a .prg file in the home directory and call that in the COMMAND line
instead.

   COMMAND=DO vfpStart.prg

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Command window, type the following:

   " _VFP.EditorOptions = "" " (without the quotation marks)

2. Quit and then restart Visual FoxPro 7.

3. In the Command window, type the following:

   " ? _VFP.EditorOptions " (without the quotation marks)

Note that EditorOptions has been restored to the default.
