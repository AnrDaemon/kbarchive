The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server (SMS) built-in backup task may not finish or may
stop running and the following error message may be logged as the last log entry
in the Smsbkup.log file:

   Successfully ran command line 'ECHO' (exit status 0). SMS_SITE_BACKUP Tue Jan
   01 1:23:45.6789 2001 Eastern Daylight Time thread=001 (0x001)

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because there are spaces in the backup location path. A
valid path to a backup location cannot contain spaces.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually stop and then restart all SMS services.

You can also change the backup folder location to a share or file location that
does not contain any spaces, for example, you can change the location to
G:\Smsbackup.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
