TITLE   :SMS: Cannot Install the SMS Client on Windows XP Home Edition
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbsetup kbsms200 kbsms200preSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install the Systems Management Server (SMS) client on a
Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition-based computer, you may receive a "Unsupported
OS version or Platform" error message. Note that the error message is generated
after you run SMSLS or SMSMAN. You may also see the following entry in the
Wnmanual.log file:

   Unsupported OS version or Platform; exiting

CAUSE
=====

This by design behavior occurs because Windows XP Home Edition is not a
supported operating system for use with SMS. Before SMS 2.0 Service Pack 4
(SP4), installations on Windows XP Home Edition-based computers were not
blocked. However, SMS 2.0 SP4 no longer permits the installation of the SMS
client on Windows XP Home Edition-based computers.
