SUMMARY
=======

Since the release of SQL Server 2000, Microsoft has identified a number of
issues between SQL Server 2000 and the Visual Basic 6.0 T-SQL Stored Procedure
Debugger add-in, which originally released in 1998. This article lists the most
significant issues.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information about any of the issues that are listed, please
consult the referenced Microsoft Knowledge Base articles:

 - In Visual Basic Service 6.0 Pack 4 (SP4) and earlier, the debugger does not
   correctly parse the SQL Server 2000 @RETURN_VALUE parameter, which has been
   renamed from RETURN_VALUE. As a result, stored procedure parameters are
   listed incorrectly in the debugger window, and the procedure will not execute
   correctly. Visual Basic 6.0 SP5 resolves this issue.

   Q272074 FIX: T-SQL Debugger Parses SQL Server 2000 Return Value Incorrectly

 - The SQDBG_SS folder on CD 2 of Microsoft Visual Studio or Visual Basic
   Enterprise Edition contains a setup program for the automated installation of
   the debugging components that are required on the SQL Server. However, this
   setup program fails on SQL Server 2000, and you must install the components
   manually.

   Q281644 BUG: SQL Debugging Does Not Install Automatically on SQL Server 2000

 - The debugger does not work with SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 1. This problem
   has been fixed in SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 2.

   Q303324 FIX: SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 1 Breaks Visual Basic T-SQL
   Debugger

 - The debugger does not work with a named instance of SQL Server 2000.

   Q310647 BUG: Visual Basic 6.0 T-SQL Debugger Fails Against SQL Server 2000
   Named Instance
