TITLE   :CONN: Err Msg: The User Is Not the Network Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may get the following error message when you run the Macintosh Connection
Name Utility (CNU):

   The user is not the Network Manager.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur on two conditions:

 - The account and/or password supplied is not correct for the Network Manager
   of the AppleTalk Mail Server currently selected.

 - The Network Manager account has recently been modified and the modifications
   have not yet been reflected in the All list. Because the CNU verifies the
   supplied account and password information against the All list, the list must
   be current for the login to succeed.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the account and/or password is not correct, specify the correct target
AppleTalk Mail server, and re-enter the Network Manager's account and password.

If the Network Manager account has been recently modified, and the changes are
not reflected in the All list, wait with the AppleTalk Mail Server idle until
the All list has been updated (usually within 15-20 minutes) and try again.
