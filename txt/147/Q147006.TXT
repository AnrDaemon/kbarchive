======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks database is located on a Novell NetWare
version 4.1 server, the Mail Connection Gateway must have the purge option
turned on for the MS Mail Connection Gateway store directory on the postoffice
or it may hang.

WORKAROUND
==========

To enable the purge option, do the following:

1. At the console prompt, type the following:

   "LOAD SERVMAN" (without the quotation marks)

2. Choose Console Set Commands from the Available Options menu.

3. Choose File System from the Categories menu.

4. Change the following parameters in the File system menu to the indicated
   values:

   Immediate Purge on Deleted Files=ON
   File Deleted Wait Time=0
   Minimum File Delete Wait Time=0

5. Press the Escape key (ESC) twice to reach the Update Options menu.

6. Choose Update AUTOEXEC.NCF & STARTUP.NCF Now from the Update Options
   menu.

7. To exit SERVMAN, press the Escape key (ESC).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Mail Connection Gateway user account that logs into the Novell NetWare
version 4.1 server does not purge when it deletes files, the Macintosh side of
the gateway and the PC side of the gateway will appear to have different files
in the subdirectory. The Macintosh will try to pick up the previously deleted
files, and the gateway will appear to freeze.
