TITLE   :PRB: Error Importing Control into Component Gallery
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbide kbVC kbVC400bug kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you import an OLE Control into the Microsoft Developer Studio, the
Component Gallery reports the following error:

   Unable to import this OLE control. Make sure the control contains a valid
   type library.

CAUSE
=====

The Component Gallery is checking the version of the type library for the
control against the version of the OLE Control itself. If the versions do not
match, the error is generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

The version identification for the control and the control's type library must
be made to match. The version identification for an OLE control written in MFC
is located in .cpp file that contains the CWinApp-derived class and will have
the following format:

      const WORD _wVerMajor = 1;
      const WORD _wVerMinor = 0;

The version identification for the control's type library is located in the .odl
file for the control and will have the following format:

   [ uuid(209E0960-66DC-11CF-8B9A-444553540000), version(1.0),
   helpstring("KBCtl OLE Control module"), control ]
   library KBCTLLib

Notice that in the previous cases, the version of the control and the control's
type library (which is generated from the .odl file) match. The version is 1.0
in both cases.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. This error typically occurs when the version
identification of a control is incremented but the version of the control's type
library is not made to match.
