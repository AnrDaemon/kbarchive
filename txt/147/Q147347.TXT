SYMPTOMS

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.

   SPOOLSS.EXE

   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: <Hex address>

   generated.

   SPOOLSV.EXE

   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: <Hex address>

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you have many .SHD and .SPL files in the spool directory.
The global default location for all printer spool files is
%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\SPOOL\PRINTERS. If your spool directory is in a different
location, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, stop the Spooler service, and remove the .SHD and .SPL
files from your spool directory. In addition, remove any unused or old .TMP
files from your Temp directory. The Spooler service can then be restarted.
