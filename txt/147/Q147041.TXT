======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message with a very large recipient list, you may receive a
General Protection (GP) fault or the following non-delivery message from the
System Administrator:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.
   Date submitted: <date and time you sent the mail>
   Message title: <subject of message>

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

   <alias name of a group>(<address of the group>)
   Warning: one or more members of that group could not be located.

NOTE: When the above error occurs, the message may have been sent to some of the
users.

CAUSE
=====

The expansion of the To: list has resulted in a large number of users that
cannot be handled by the client or the message transport.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.5 of the Microsoft
Mail for Windows. A fix for this problem is in development, but has not been
regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production environments.

Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information on the
availability of this fix.
