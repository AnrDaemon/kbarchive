======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT backup program Ntbackup.exe stops responding while spanning
tapes, just after you insert a new tape. This can occur when you are performing
either a differential or a full tape backup.

CAUSE
=====

The tape backup is hitting the end of media. Fixing this would require fixing
the contents of the catalog. The problem is not specific to any tape drive
hardware, but is effected by the data backed up.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
