SUMMARY
=======

You may see strange WINS registrations in your WINS database in the form of:

   C-2602COMPUTERNAME<20>

or a variation of the above.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This registration is made by the Microsoft Mail client. The registration is made
to be able to detect when new mail has arrived for the client without having to
check the mailbag file. This behavior can be controlled by the NetBIOS=number
setting in the MSMAIL.INI file.

A setting of 1 (the default for Windows networks) allows for NetBIOS notification
and causes the Mail client to register the name. A setting of 0 turns off
NetBIOS notification and the Mail client will not register the name.

The NetBIOS name that is registered is a combination of the post office serial
number and the computer name.

For more information about the NetBIOS parameter, see page 55 of the MS Mail 3.5
"Administrator's Guide."
