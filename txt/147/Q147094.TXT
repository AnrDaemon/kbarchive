TITLE   :XCLN: View/Group By Changes Column Order, Column Size
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you click Group By on the View menu in the Microsoft Exchange Client and
select Group items by (None) or Clear All, message columns and the column order
do not appear as originally configured.

CAUSE
=====

When you choose Group By, the column order is changed to properly group the
messages. MicrosoftExchange does not maintain the original order or size of the
columns, and therefore cannot restore these settings.

Selecting Group items by (None) or Clear All might cause the message column order
to be rearranged. Some column sizes might also be set to 1 character wide,
preventing the columns from being viewed properly. Any columns that were
selected as part of the Group By criteria will be set to a length of 1 if Group
items by (None) or Clear All is selected.

RESOLUTION
==========

Select one of the predefined personal views by clicking Personal Views on the
View menu to reset the view you desire.
