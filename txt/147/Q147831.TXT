The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SUMMARY
=======

Windows 95 includes most of the MS-DOS tools included with previous versions of
Microsoft MS-DOS. This article describes how to install the other old MS-DOS
tools that are not installed automatically by Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the other MS-DOS tools, follow these steps:

1. Insert the Windows 95 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive.

   NOTE: If you have the floppy disk version of Windows 95, you can obtain the
   MS-DOS tools from online services. For information about obtaining the MS-DOS
   tools from an online service, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q135315 CD-ROM Extras for Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade

2. At a command prompt, switch to the CD-ROM drive and then change to the
   Other\Oldmsdos folder.

3. To install the MS-DOS tools in the default folders, type the following line
   and then press ENTER:

   " instsupp.bat " (without the quotation marks)

   To install the MS-DOS tools to a different folder, type the following line and
   then press ENTER

   " instsupp.bat <folder> " (without the quotation marks)

   where <folder> is the folder in which you want the tools installed.

4. Restart your computer.

If you install to a folder other than the default folder, the Msbackup files are
not copied and the Memmaker files are installed in the Windows\Command folder.
You must move these files to the Windows folder manually.

If you install to the default folders, the following files are installed in the
Windows folder:

   Chkstate.sys
   Memmaker.exe
   Memmaker.inf
   Memmaker.hlp
   Sizer.exe

If you install to the default folders, the following files are installed in the
Windows\Command folder:

   Append.exe     Qbasic.hlp
   Expand.exe     Restore.exe
   Graphics.com   Tree.com
   Graphics.pro   Undelete.exe
   Help.com       Loadfix.com
   Help.hlp       Monoumb.386
   Instsupp.bat   Print.exe
   Interlnk.exe   Qbasic.exe
   Intersvr.exe   Replace.exe

If you specify an installation folder other than the Windows folder, all the
files listed above are installed in that folder except for the following files.
These files must be copied manually:

   Msbackdb.ovl   Msbackup.hlp
   Msbconfg.ovl   Msbackup.exe
   Msbackup.ovl   Msbackfr.ovl
   Msbconfg.hlp   Msbackdr.ovl
   Msbackfb.ovl

When you use the Instsupp.bat file to install the MS-DOS tools, the Setver table
is updated to reflect the changes. However, the Setver table is not updated for
Restore.exe. For additional information about this issue, please see the
