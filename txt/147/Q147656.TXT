SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft has released an updated version of Microsoft Backup (Backup.exe
version 4.0.952) that corrects the following problems:

 - If you have a tape drive installed in your computer and you click the Restore
   tab in Backup, click a backup set file, and then click Next Step, the Erase
   Tape command on the Tools menu may be available even if there is no tape in
   the tape drive. If you click the Erase Tape command and the backup set file
   that you selected is located on a floppy disk, hard disk, or network drive,
   all the data on the disk containing the backup set file may be erased.

 - When you restore a backup set created with Backup, you may receive the
   following error message:

   Microsoft Backup has encountered a serious error in the Memory Manager. Quit
   Microsoft Backup and all other running programs, restart Backup, and then try
   again. If the problem persists, try reinstalling Backup.
