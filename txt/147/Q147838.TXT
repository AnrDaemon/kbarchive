PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork 3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClientkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are browsing a Novell NetWare server from a 16-bit program using the
Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks, you may not see any files or folders when
you browse a folder with a long file name.

RESOLUTION
==========


To work around this problem, use any one of the following methods:

 - Type the exact path to the file, using NetWare's short file names for the
   folders and files.

 - Do not name folders on NetWare servers with long file names. You can still
   use long file names for files.

 - Use the Novell NetWare Workstation Shell and a real-mode Novell NetWare
   client instead of the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks.

   Note that real-mode Novell NetWare clients do not support viewing long file
   names on NetWare servers from 32-bit Windows 95-based programs.

STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
