KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A mail message sent from the Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows
version 3.2 or 3.5 client, may result in a non-delivery message similar to the
following:

   From: POSTMASTER
   To: < sender of message >
   Subject: Mail failure
   Date: Thursday, May 23, 1996 3:22PM

   FROM: < sender of message >
   TO: < recipient of message >
   DATE: 23-05-96
   TIME: 15:22

   SUBJECT: < subject of message >

   ----------------------------------------------------------------

   [003] Message hop count exceeded. Message followed the following route:
   NETCAD/HBPO01
   NETCAD/BUPO01
   NETGRI1/RH02
   NETGRI1/IH01
   NETSIS/WO01
   NETSIS/EUO01
   NETSIS/HUB02
   NETUFE/HUB01
   NETUFE/HUB03
   NETUDI/UDIPO1

   while attempting to send to the following addresses:
   <net>/<po>/<mailbox>

CAUSE
=====

The non-delivery report is generated when the number of hops reaches ten,
regardless of the hop count setting as configured in the Admin program. The
Remote Windows client does not pick up the administrator set hop count from the
postoffice. The client inserts a hop count of ten in all messages.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location as Remcy2k.exe:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/mail/pcmail-public/All-Y2K/


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail Remote for
Windows version 3.2.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows Remote Client has no access to the hop count as set by the
administrator on the home postoffice. The 3.05.0030 version of external
implements code to insert the postoffice value of hop count into remote client
messages. Prior versions of external did not change the value of hop count when
handling remote client messages.

In the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Administrators Guide, Chapter 7, is a
section describing the purpose of hop count and the procedure to set it. This
setting is designed to affect all client mail for users having a mailbox on the
postoffice.

See Article Q147368 for more information about a similar hop count problem for
messages generated by the Microsoft Mail for Windows client.
