TITLE   :XCLN: Not Open Attachment w/ Incorrect Extension
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you insert a Microsoft Word for Windows version 6.0 into a mail message with
an incorrect file name extension, such as .Dxx instead of .Doc, the document can
not be opened even if you rename the original document or the attachment with a
valid file name extension. When you try to open the attachment, you will get the
following error message:

   The application associated with this attachment could not be started. Verify
   the application is installed on your system with a correct directory path.

CAUSE
=====

When you insert a Microsoft Word document into a mail message, Microsoft
Exchange immediately makes a temporary copy of that file, with the same file
name and file name extension, and points to that copy. It is that copy that is
transmitted with the mail message. Therefore, renaming the original document or
the attachment will have no effect because a link has been established to the
invalid copy.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Attachments created with the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client and Microsoft
Word for Windows version 7.0 can be opened, because Microsoft Word 7.0 looks at
the file header to determine the type of file, rather than the file name
extension.
