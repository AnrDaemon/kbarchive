SUMMARY
=======

To install and start Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0, 5.0, or 5.5, you
need to create an Exchange Server service account with Domain User rights. This
account is used to start the Exchange Server services. Create the account using
the User Manager for Domains program that is provided with Microsoft Windows NT
Server. During Exchange Server installation, Setup requests a service account
and adds "Log On as a Service," "Restore Files and Directories," and "Act as
Part of the Operating System" rights to this account.
