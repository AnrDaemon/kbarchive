TITLE   :XCLN: Win: Encrypted Messages Do Not Display Attachment Icon
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you receive a signed and sealed (encrypted) message with an attachment, the
icon indicating that the message has an attachment does not appear. However,
when you forward that message without encryption, the paper clip icon (which
denotes an attachment) will appear.

CAUSE
=====

An encrypted message has its properties, including attachments, removed. All
that remains is the encrypted TNEF (which contains the properties that were
encrypted). This means that the Exchange client does not know that an encrypted
message contained attachments because the attachment properties have been
deleted.

Additional query words: encryption security
