SUMMARY
=======

Compaq's Turbo DAT 4/16 tape drive on Compaq Proliant 1500 P-100 system fails
when performing a full tape backup. The tape backup fails at the end of the
first tape and before requiring a second tape. The differential tape backup
works normally.

MORE INFORMATION

The full tape backup is hitting the end of media. Fixing this would require
fixing the contents of the catalog.
