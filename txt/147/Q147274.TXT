The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print an Exchange message with an attachment, if the Print Attachments
option is selected in the Print dialog box, the message body will be printed to
the printer selected in this dialog box. However, the attachment will be printed
to the Windows default printer.

If the selected printer is not the default printer, then the message and
attachment output will be to two different printers.

If the Default Printer is the one that is selected when you choose Print on the
File menu, the message and attachments will be printed to the default printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the default printer for Microsoft Windows to the desired printer before
choosing Print from the File menu in Microsoft Exchange.
