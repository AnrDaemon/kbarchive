-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Human Body for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running the Bus Stop Utility included with Magic School Bus Explores
the Human Body (MSB Human) under Windows 95/98, and you click Launch MIDI
Mapper, nothing may happen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MIDI Mapper is a program that is not included with Windows 95/98. Because the
configuration of MIDI is handled differently in Windows 95/98 than it was in
Windows 3.x, the MIDI Mapper is not functional and therefore, it is not
available. When you try to run MIDI Mapper from within Bus Stop Utility - Human
Body, the computer does not respond.

For more information on MIDI configuration for MSB Human in Windows 95/98, please
