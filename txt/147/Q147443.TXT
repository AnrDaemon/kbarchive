The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194248.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you browse a form, such as the Feedback.htm file by opening the form as a
local file, and then click the Submit button, you get the following error
message:

   Could not open file
   C:\content\<webname>\_vti_bin/shtml.exe/feedback.htm.

CAUSE
=====

The file is opened as a file; that is, it is not being accessed on the server.
Since it is not being accessed on the server, the server extensions (shtml.exe)
are not accessible to the local files and they cannot be processed. The
background processing will occur only for files located on a Web were the
Personal Web Server or the FrontPage Server Extensions are installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Open the file by specifying the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), like this:

   http://<machinename>/<webname>/feedback.htm
