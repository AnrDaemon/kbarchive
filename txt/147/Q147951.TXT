    2     MS-DOS SNA Server Client on Windows NT platform (for use with IBM

    3     Windows 3.x SNA Server Client on Windows NT platform. The Windows
          3.x SNA Server client must be used on a Windows NT computer
          (where a 16-bit 3270/FMI application runs). The Windows NT SNA
          Server client provides a thunking layer for all other SNA Server
          API's. There are special instructions for the installation of the
          Windows SNA Server 3.x client in Windows NT (where the actual SNA
          Server is running on the system:

           - Start the Windows SNA Server 3.x client setup on the SNA
             Server.
           - In the "Client/Server Protocols" dialog box, select the
             TCP/IP. NOTE: If you have SNA Server 2.11 SP1, select Novell
             Netware.
           - In the "SNA Server Location" dialog box, select the Remote.
             Enter the IP address or computer name of the SNA Server that
             the Windows 3.x client is being installed. In other words, the
             remote destination is pointing to itself. If you select Novell
             Netware, then enter the SNA Server domain name and add the
             following entries to the [wnap] section in WIN.INI:

                [wnap]
                Remote=<domainname>
                NosType=NETWARE

             In this configuration, both 32-bit and 16-bit 3270/FMI
             applications can work on the same computer).

    4        Windows 3.x SNA Server Client on Windows 95 platform. The
             Windows 3.x SNA Server client must be used in Windows 95 if
             you want to run any 16-bit SNA Server aware application. No
             thunking is provided for any SNA Server API on the Windows 95
             SNA Server client. To use the Windows 95 SNA Server client, a
             32-bit application must be used.
