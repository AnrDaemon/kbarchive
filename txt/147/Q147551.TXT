RESOLUTION
==========

The system events that appear in the Event Viewer are by design.

To correct the problem with the serial mouse:

1. Make sure that the Calcomp Digitizer drivers are installed by following the
   instructions included with the Calcomp drivers. Turn the digitizer power off
   and verify that the digitizer tablet is properly connected to the computer.

2. Verify that the settings of the serial mouse, the digitizer, and other
   hardware peripherals. Make sure that each device is using a unique IRQ, COM
   port and Base I/O port address. In Windows NT, run Control Panel Ports and
   select the COM port. Click Settings and then click Advanced to view the IRQ
   and Base I/O Port Address settings.

If there are no resource conflicts, proceed to step 3. If you have detected
resource conflicts (especially with the digitizer), contact Calcomp Technical
Support at (800) 458-5888 and see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
