TITLE   :PRB: Visual C++ Seems to Hang - Updating Source Control Status
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:4.00 4.10 4.20 | 4.00 4.10 4.20
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While running Visual C++, you notice that the system seems to be hung and the
message "Updating source code control status" appears in the status bar.

CAUSE
=====

Visual C++ is querying Visual SourceSafe to check the status of files so that
Visual C++ can keep its icons up to date. It is this querying that takes so much
time and makes it seem like Visual C++ has hung. By default, Visual C++ is
installed so that this functionality is activated; it checks the status of ten
files each time it queries.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can turn off the functionality of updating the status of the files, or you
can reduce the number of files that Visual C++ checks. Both solutions require
changing the Registry. Please back up the registry before attempting either of
these.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT or Windows 95 to correct
them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

1. Back up the Registry

2. In Windows NT, start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the
   following subkey:

      HKEY_Current_User on Local
         Machine\Software\Microsoft\Developer\Source Control

   -or-

   In Windows 95, start the Registry Editor (Regedit.exe), and go to the
   following subkey:

      HKEY_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Developer\Source Control

3. If you want to turn off the updating of Visual C++ icons completely,
   double-click AllowStatusUpdates, and change it from the default of 1(On) to
   0(Off). This will keep Visual C++ from querying Visual SourceSafe.

   -or-

   If you want to reduce the number of files that it updates, double-click
   StatusThreshold, and change it from the default of 10 to 1. This will reduce
   the number of files it checks each time Visual C++ queries Visual SourceSafe.

4. Exit the Registry Editor.

5. Restart Visual C++ to allow it to read the new values from the registry.

NOTE: Reducing the number of files Visual C++ queries will not reduce the time
between each call to Visual SourceSafe. It will just reduce the amount of time
the system seems to hang each time it queries.
