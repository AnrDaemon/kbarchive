The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, versions 3.11, 3.11a, 3.11b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

DHCP client computers are unable to obtain leases from DHCP servers over Proteon
CNX500, CNX600, RBX200 and DNX300 routers.


CAUSE
=====

The DHCP client properly sends the DHCP Discover packet to the DHCP server over
the router and the server responds with a DHCP Offer packet. This problem occurs
when the router does not forward the DHCP Offer packet to the client computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, obtain the software upgrade version 15.2A - Patch level
37 from Proteon Technical Support at (508) 898-3100. To verify the software
version of your Proteon router, type the following command at the * prompt:

T 5 C

The configuration of the router appears. The second line displays the version
number and patch level.
