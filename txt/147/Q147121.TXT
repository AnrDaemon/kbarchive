TITLE   :XADM: Cannot Incremental Restore Until Full Backup Is Restored
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt an Incremental Restore of the Information Store, the following
error message appears:

   Unable to restore data to <Server Name>\<Directory>,
   Check the application event log for more information.

The following Source NTBackup event appears:

   Microsoft Exchange services returned 'The databases have not been restored to
   this machine. You cannot restore an incremental backup until a full backup
   has been restored' from a call to "RestoreRegister[]" additional data '-'.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you select the Start Services After Restore check box in
the Normal (Full) Restore Property screen, and you run the Incremental Restore
immediately after the Full Restore (when the services are starting).

The Incremental restore process copies the logs to the MDBData directory when the
services are starting up and the original logs are being played. The process
does not check if the services are currently started. Therefore, ensure that the
Exchange services are stopped before running an Incremental restore of the
Information Store database.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Perform the Normal (Full) Information Store from the tape again.

2. Clear the Start Services After Restore check box.

3. Run the Incremental Restore of the Information Store. If this is the last
   incremental set to restore, select the Start Services After Restore check
   box.
