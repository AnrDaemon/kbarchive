MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a dialog resource with Developer Studio.

2. Double-click the dialog resource, and remove the Titlebar and System Menu
   settings from the Styles tab in the Dialog Properties dialog.

3. Under the Styles tab, change the Border to Thin.

4. Switch the Workspace window to the ResourceView pane.

5. Right-click the dialog's id, listed in the ResourceView.

6. Choose Properties from the Context menu. Note that the dialog displayed in
   the preview window of the Properties dialog, is drawn with a caption.

NOTE: When the dialog is invoked in the test mode (CTRL+T), the dialog is
correctly displayed without a caption.
