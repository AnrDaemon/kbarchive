TITLE   :Application Exception When AppleTalk Clients Try Connecting
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server stops responding (hangs) and Appletalk client computers are
unable to attain session connections. In the Event Viewer, the following
application events appear:

   Event ID: 624
   Source: SNADUMP.LOG
   Description: A process SNABASE.EXE ended abnormally due to a protection
   violation, or similar condition.

   Event ID: 4097
   Source: Dr. Watson Log
   This application, SNABASE.DBG generated an applicaiton error. The error
   occurred on <date>. The exception generated was C0000005 at address
   <address>.

A portion of the DRWTSN32.LOG file states the following:

   App: snabase.DBG (pid=160)
        When: <date> @ <time>
        Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

NOTE: Your DRWTSN32.LOG file will appear somewhat different than this example.


CAUSE
=====

The SNAAT.DLL send routine is not checking to see if the L-Table is already in a
closing state. Therefore, it tries to access its pending queue, which has been
released. This causes the application exception in SNABASE.EXE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11 and 2.11
Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server
2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
