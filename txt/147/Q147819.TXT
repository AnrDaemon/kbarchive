TITLE   :Update Job Fails If Clients Logged On to Share
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:1.10
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDespooler smsdespooler

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A repeating job to update any kind of package distribution job will fail if
there are clients logged on to the share. We currently have no mechanism for
removing and keeping users off of shares while a share is being updated by
Systems Management Server.

CAUSE
=====

The job status remains in retry mode for a week until the job actually gets
marked as having failed. Despooler is unable to copy new files to the server
share because some of the files in the server share were in use by clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Systems Management Server 1.1.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
