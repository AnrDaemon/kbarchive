TITLE   :XADM: Setup Displays Remote Server Does Not Respond Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have nearly finished installing Microsoft Exchange Server, you might
see the following error message:

   While processing file 'server.ins' at or near line 369, the remote server did
   not respond.

   MSExchange Directory ID no:

   DS_E_COMMUNICATIONS_PROBLEM.

CAUSE
=====

There might be a latency issue with the Microsoft Exchange Directory service
when you install Microsoft Exchange Server. After the call to ServerInstall(),
it attempts to perform a bind immediately. This can produce a communications
failure.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, slow down the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
program by lowering foreground priority and running other CPU or I/O bound
applications while you are installing the Microsoft Exchange Server.
