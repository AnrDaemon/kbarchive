SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a new Personal Folder (that is, a new .PST file), there is no
Inbox, Outbox, or Sent Items folder.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can create a new Personal Folder by choosing Services from the Tools menu
and choosing to add a Personal Folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A new Personal Folder will not have Inbox, Outbox, and Sent Items folders unless
this new Personal Folder is designated to be located where your incoming mail is
delivered.

You can set Delivery of New Mail Location either in the Client from Tools,
Services or from the Control Panel, Mail and Fax option. By default, you receive
mail in your server-based mailbox, named Mailbox - Your Name.
