OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run UPDATE.EXE in Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 4 on the SYS volume of a
NetWare server, some files in the \PUBLIC and \LOGIN directories are
overwritten.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not connect to the root of the SYS volume. For
example, do not connect to \\NetWare\SYS. Instead, connect to \\NetWare\SYS\I386
(assuming that the Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 4 files reside in I386).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 Service
Pack 4. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
