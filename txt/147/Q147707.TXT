TITLE   :INVProc Does Not Remove Packages Group when It Is Empty
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the number of inventory packages drops to 0 (zero), inventory processor
fails to create the Pragma: delete in the delta mif file, which leaves the
history records as current.

CAUSE
=====

The *.RAW file created by the inventory has no Software entry (it is reporting
correctly). However, the delta MIF files created by Inventory Processor have no
":deletepragma" for the Packages group to update the database.

WORKAROUND
==========

To remove all the inventory packages, use DBClean.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in System Management Server
versions 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
