SYMPTOMS
========

When you are working in 3D Movie Maker, the program may stop responding (hang)
with a sound card that is not configured to use an FM Synthesis MIDI driver.

RESOLUTION

Switch the configuration of the MIDI driver to use the FM Synthesis or OPL2/OPL3
driver (or equivalent) by following the steps below:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Multimedia, then click the MIDI tab.

3. Make sure Single Instrument is selected and it references MIDI for Internal
   FM Synthesizer (or equivalent).

4. Click OK to exit Multimedia.

5. Run 3D Movie Maker.

The program should run successfully after following these steps.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some sound cards may attempt to use a MIDI driver to play MIDI in a manner that
is incompatible with the way that 3D Movie Maker plays MIDI.
