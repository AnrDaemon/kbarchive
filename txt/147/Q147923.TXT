KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The remote computer does not reboot when you use SHUTCMD.EXE, which is included
in the Windows NT Resource Kit. However, if you use the Shutcmd command within
15 minutes since a clean shutdown of the computer, the command completes
successfully.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you use the graphical scheduler that is included in the
Windows NT Resource Kit. If you add the shutcmd command in a batch file and
specify the AT command to execute the batch file, the same symptom mentioned
above occurs.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
