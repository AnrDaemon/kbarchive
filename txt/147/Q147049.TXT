TITLE   :XCLN: Err Msg: The Print Operation Could not be Completed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The error message listed below might occur if the Print Layouts and Paper
Formats component of Microsoft Schedule+ was not installed when you installed
the Microsoft Exchange client. This error message will occur when you attempt to
print a meeting request from within the Microsoft Exchange client.

   The print operation could not be completed. Cannot print because there are no
   valid .FMT files available.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the Microsoft Exchange Client Setup program, click Add/Remove, select
Schedule+, click Change Option, check Print Layouts and Paper Formats, and click
OK. Once installed, you will be able to print meeting requests from the
Microsoft Exchange client.

For Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x clients, this can also be caused by the
following line not being present in the Schplus.ini file:

   LocalPrintFileDir=<Path to client install directory or directory where
                      the FMT files are located>

For Microsoft Exchange Windows NT and Windows 95 clients, the following Registry
location must be present in the registry.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Schedule+\Application
   String: LocalPrintFileDir
   Value: <Path to client install directory or directory where the FMT
           files are located>

This can also be changed for an entire Microsoft Exchange client install point by
running the STF Editor and making the change in the following location:

1. From the File menu, click Modify Setup Program Options.

2. Click the Components tab.

3. Click the Schedule+ Change Option button.

4. Make sure the Print Layouts and Paper Formats option is checked.
