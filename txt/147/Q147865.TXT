-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an ISDN modem with Dial-Up Networking to dial an analog phone line,
you may receive the following error message if there is no answer on the analog
line:

   The computer is not receiving a response from the modem. Check that the modem
   is plugged in, and if necessary, turn the modem off, and then turn it back
   on.

CAUSE
=====

This error message is caused by an incorrect parameter passed from the NDIS WAN
Miniport drivers. When this happens, Dial-Up Networking displays the generic
error message stated above.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the ISDN Accelerator Pack for
Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 version 1.0. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
