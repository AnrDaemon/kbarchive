TITLE   :FIX: Building an .OCX Always Runs Regsvr32
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.0 4.1 4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC kbVC500fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you build an .ocx, Regsvr32.exe is always called whether or not the
compilation succeeds. If you start the build by pressing F5 (Build:Debug :Go),
and there are compiler errors, after Regsvr32.exe is run, the debugger will be
launched if you have an existing copy of your debug executable. This same
problem occurs on any project that uses a custom build option for the project.
Note that having custom build settings for individual files in the project will
not effect this behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the custom build command, and add a custom tool to the Tools menu. In the
case of the .ocx file, Regsvr32 is already registered as a Tool. You can run
Regsvr32 as a separate step when necessary.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a default .ocx project by selecting OLE ControlWizard as the project
   type.

2. Successfully build the .ocx file.

3. Introduce a compiler error into your source code.

4. Press F5 to build your application. After the failed build, Regsvr32 is
   launched followed by the debugger.
