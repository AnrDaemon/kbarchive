======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under circumstances similar to the following, ClassWizard may cause an access
violation:

 - You derive a class, CMyRecordset1, from CRecordset using ClassWizard.

 - You derive another class, CMyRecordset2, from CRecordset using ClassWizard.

 - You replace all occurrences of CRecordset in the .cpp and .h files for
   CMyRecordset2 with CMyRecordset1

The result is that CRecordset2 will be derived from CRecordset1. When ClassWizard
is invoked to view CMyRecordset2, an access violation may occur. This problem
has been verified with both CRecordset and CDaoRecordset.

RESOLUTION
==========

Leave occurrences of CRecordset in the ClassWizard comments. Particularly, don't
change:

      //{{AFX_FIELD(CRecordset2, CRecordset)

to:

      //{{AFX_FIELD(CRecordset2, CRecordset1)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++, 32-bit
Edition, version 4.2.
