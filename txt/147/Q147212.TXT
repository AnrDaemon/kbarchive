TITLE   :Send Fax Wizard Does Not Convert Long File Name for Attachment
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a message composed using the Send Fax Wizard contains attachments with long
file names, the attachments are not converted to short file names when they are
received by a Windows 3.x Microsoft Mail client. If you double-click such an
attachment in the Microsoft Mail client, you receive a message stating that the
file is not associated with a program.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, save the attachment in the Microsoft Mail client to
an appropriate short file name with the correct extension. You can then open the
attachment using the short file name.
