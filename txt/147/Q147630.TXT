TITLE   :FIX: Remote Monitor Quits When TCP/IP Isn't Loaded
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDebug kbide kbVC500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Starting up the Visual C++ Debug Monitor (Msvcmon.exe) with Network (TCP/IP)
selected and pressing the Connect button causes the following error:

   General network failure (Windows Sockets error 10047)

The monitor then continues to attempt to connect to the host. On Windows 95, when
you press the Disconnect button, the monitor quits.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the TCP/IP protocol is not installed on the
computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

The problem can be avoided by ensuring that the TCP/IP protocol is installed on
the computer. To do this, start the Network applet in the Control Panel, and add
TCP/IP as a protocol.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On Windows NT, the Windows Sockets error message occurs, but the monitor does
not quit.
