-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) may fail to deliver the
message contents when sending a message across an X400 connector configured to
use ISO 6937 body parts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem was introduced in version 995.50 of the MTA. This problem is
independent of the type of X400 MTA that receives the message that originates
from Microsoft Exchange. Messages will be delivered successfully to the intended
recipients but the message body will be missing.

This problem will only occur when using MTA builds 995.50, 995.51, 995.52, and
995.53 when an X400 connector is configured as follows:

   General Tab
   -----------
   Remote Clients Support MAPI is not checked

   Advanced Tab
   ------------
   ISO 6937 Body Part is checked
   Allow MS Exchange Contents is not checked

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange
Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
