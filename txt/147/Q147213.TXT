KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send Internet mail using Microsoft Exchange, the mail may remain in the
Outbox. You may or may not be able to receive incoming Internet mail.

CAUSE
=====

Although your computer is connected to the Internet properly, the Internet Mail
information service may not be configured properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the properties of the Internet Mail information service. Make sure that
all the information is correct, particularly the Internet Mail Server entry.

If there are other information services in the profile, try creating a new
profile with only the Internet Mail information service. You can use the .pab
and .pst files from the original profile if you want. This should remove any
conflicts among delivery services.

If the e-mail address or account name uses the "user@provider.com" format, try
removing the "@provider.com" portion. Also, check the personal address book
itself. If a recipient is not in the personal address book, you may need to
create an entry for the recipient in the personal address book for the message
to be delivered.
