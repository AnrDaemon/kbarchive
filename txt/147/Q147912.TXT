TITLE   :Server Operator Unable to Synchronize Domain Controller
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A user account logged on as a Server Operator is able to highlight the Primary
Domain Controller (PDC) in Server Manager and successfully initiate a
"Synchronize Entire Domain," but receives "Access Denied" when attempting to
synchronize a single Backup Domain Controller (BDC) to the PDC.

WORKAROUND
==========

To synchronize the user account database of a backup domain controller with its
primary, from the command prompt at the console of the BDC, issue a: "net
accounts /sync".

For a synchronization of machine accounts and user account information, use the
"Synchronize Entire Domain" selection in Server Manager.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server versions 3.5,
3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
