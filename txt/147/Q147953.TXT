TITLE   :Last Software Scan Date Not Updated for Windows NT Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Last Software Scan date for a Windows NT client computer in Personal
Computer Properties of Systems Management Server is not current or consistent
with the Software Inventory Frequency set for the site. The Last Hardware Scan
date is current.

CAUSE
=====

If you do not have any Software Packages configured for Inventory, the Inventory
Agent for Windows NT (INVWIN32.EXE) does not perform a Software Scan. This
behavior does not occur with the Inventory Agent for MS-DOS clients
(INVDOS.EXE).

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, force the Inventory Agent for Windows NT
(INVWIN32.EXE) to scan for software. To do this, configure at least one package
for Software Inventory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. The problem has been fixed in Systems Management Server version 1.2
