======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click About Microsoft Schedule+ on the Help menu, the picture that
appears in the About Microsoft Schedule+ dialog box may not completely fill the
outline; that is, there may be some empty space below the picture inside the
border that appears around the picture.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you set the Font Size option for your display to Large
Fonts.

Each of the Office applications displays a picture in the About Microsoft
<application> dialog box (where <application> is the name of the
Office application that you are running. A thin border appears as a frame around
the picture. When you use the Large Fonts setting for your display, this picture
appears smaller than when you use the Small Fonts option.

In Microsoft Schedule+, when you use the Large Fonts setting, the picture in the
About Microsoft Schedule+ dialog box appears smaller than the border that frames
the picture, so that empty space appears inside the frame at the bottom of the
picture.

NOTE: This problem occurs when you use the Large Font setting on the Settings tab
in the Display Properties dialog box in Windows, regardless of the font sizes
you use for the Windows screen elements (Appearance tab).

This display problem does not occur in the other Microsoft Office applications.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can change the Font Size option for your
display in Microsoft Windows by doing the following:

1. On the taskbar, click Start, and then click Settings. Click Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click the Display icon.

3. In the Display Properties dialog box, click the Settings tab. In the Font
   Size list, click Large Fonts. Click OK.

4. Click Yes to restart your computer.
