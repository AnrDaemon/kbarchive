SUMMARY
=======

This article describes a function you can use to determine which option button
in a control array is selected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A common programming task in Visual Basic, given a control array of option
buttons, is to determine which option button in the array is selected. The
option button that is selected will have its Value property set to True, while
all others will have Value properties of False. This article outlines a short
function that will return the index of the selected option button when it is
passed a reference to a control array of option buttons. It will work correctly
even when some indexes are skipped or not present in the control array. In
addition, to avoid logic errors in writing code, it will fail and return a -1 if
it is passed a control array of another type of object (like a check box). The
function was contributed by Bruce McKinney, author of Hardcore Visual Basic,
which is published by Microsoft Press.

The code for the function is:

   Function GetOption(opts As Object) As Integer
       On Error GoTo GetOptionFail
       Dim opt As OptionButton
       For Each opt In opts
           If opt.Value Then
               GetOption = opt.Index
               Exit Function
           End If
       Next

   GetOptionFail:
       GetOption = -1

   End Function

This function can be called like this:

   myVariable = GetOption(optMyButtons)   'Control syntax OK
   myVariable = GetOption(optMyButtons()) 'Array syntax OK
