SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange has the capability to define rules to automatically operate
on messages in the Inbox or a public folder. There is a 32K "packed data" limit
for the rules on each folder, whether Inbox or public folders. The maximum
number of rules depends on the size of the rules defined and the amount of data
required for a rule varies depending on the rule. For example, a rule to move
messages into a folder, for a single recipient, takes about 660 bytes. Hence
there is no defined limit for the maximum number of rules that can be assigned
to a folder. On the average it is between 40 and 50 rules per folder.

The following error will be displayed when the number of rules exhaust the 32K
memory limit:

   Changes to the rule could not be saved. There is not enough memory or the
   rules are too complex. Try deleting some rules.
