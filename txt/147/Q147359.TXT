TITLE   :XCLN: How to Activate URLs by Default
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::3.1,3.11,4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook, Exchange Server Edition, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Exchange Client, versions 4.0, 5.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

For performance reasons, the Windows 16-bit Microsoft Exchange client does not
activate URLs by default. This can be changed by adding an [Options] section to
the Windows\Exchng.ini file to contain this line:

   browser=c:\path\iexplore.exe

The browser line should point to the preferred browser. After this has been done,
you will need to restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You might notice that URLs appear hot even though the browser line is not
present in their Exchng.Ini file. The action of reading a message with a URL
enclosed is what activates the URL. If another client has previously read the
message and forwarded it to the Microsoft Exchange Win16 client, the link will
be hot but the client will still be unable to jump to the URL because a browser
has not been configured.
