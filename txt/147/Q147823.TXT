The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you update Microsoft Windows for Workgroups clients from the compact disc
for Windows NT Server version 3.5 or 3.51, and there are multiple clients that
need to be updated, you can create a batch file that can be run either from a
login script or through Systems Management Server (SMS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you attempt to run a batch file, make sure that the directory being
shared has sufficient share and directory permissions and that file attributes
are not read-only. You will also need to include in your batch file the attrib
command to remove read-only attributes from the files that are being replaced on
the local drive. Net.exe and Net.msg should be copied to the Windows directory.
The remaining files should be copied to the system directory. Restart Windows.

NOTE: Test this on a single computer first before broad implementation.
