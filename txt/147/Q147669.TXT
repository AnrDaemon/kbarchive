PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbAppSetup kbDSSTools kbVBp400 kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Immediately after a Setup-Wizard-generated setup program starts and displays the
"Copying initialization files..." dialog box, one of the following error
messages appears:

   (16-bit application)
   $(SomePath)\FileName.ext
   Cannot create temporary file. The file could not be installed.

   (32-bit application)
   Setup will now start the application removal utility to remove
   temporary installation files.

NOTE: Microsoft Technical Support does not support any modifications to the Setup
Wizard.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused when one or more shared files have their installation
directory changed from the default directory in step 7 of the Setup Wizard. The
behavior of any setup media generated after modifying the installation directory
of shared files is undefined. Shared files should always be installed into the
default directory specified.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start either the 16-bit or 32-bit version of the Visual Basic 4.0 Setup
   Wizard.

2. Select the \VB\SAMPLES\CALC\CALC.VBP sample project.

3. Choose Next repeatedly until Step 7 of the wizard is reached.

4. Ensure that either VB40016.DLL or VB40032.DLL is selected and then press the
   'File Details' button.

5. Using the Destination Directory combo box, change the install path for the
   file selected in step four from $(WinSysPath) to $(AppPath). Allow the Setup
   Wizard to finish and create distribution media.

6. Run the SETUP.EXE program that the Setup Wizard has generated. Observe the
   behavior described in the Symptoms section above.
