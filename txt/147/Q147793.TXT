SUMMARY
=======

It may be beneficial for you to specify which Microsoft Systems Management
Server Windows NT Server logon server a Systems Management Server client user
logs on to. This is especially true when domain controllers for the same domain
span multiple Systems Management Server sites. The ability to specify logon
servers ensures that inventory shows up in the proper site databases. This can
be accomplished by substituting a specified logon server (or servers) for the
domain entry in the [workgroup] section of the Smsls.ini file (located in the
Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box directory of the site server).

MORE INFORMATION
================

A sample [workgroup] section specifying that all users in WorkgroupA use logon
server ServerA or ServerB, and that users in WorkgroupB use the logon server
ServerC would look like this:

      [workgroup]
      WorkgroupA=\\ServerA
      WorkgroupA=\\ServerB
      WorkgroupB=\\ServerC

For related information about mapping clients in Smsls.ini, see page 92 of the
"Microsoft Systems Management Server Administrator's Guide."
