TITLE   :XGEN: Cannot Get Free/Busy for Server Group on Another PO
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view free and busy times in Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0, a version
3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks group will have a question mark next to
the group name.

CAUSE
=====

This is a Microsoft Mail 3.2 limitation. You will not be able to get details on
the group from the Address Book of the other postoffice (PO). Group members are
not available across POs.

Notes:

 - If you invite the group from its own PO, it works.

 - If you use Admin.exe to import the users into the second PO, and create a
   group of those users, the group works.

 - If you send a meeting request to the original group, the members receive the
   request.
