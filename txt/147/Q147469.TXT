PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbConfig kbDatabase smsconfig smsdatabase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server (SMS) there is no way to change a site server
computer's NetBIOS name without reinstalling the site. Reinstalling the site and
then restoring from a backup does not work.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS site server name is stored throughout the SQL database and in the
Windows NT registry. SMS services use UNC names to communicate with and maintain
the site server. Changing the server's NetBIOS name causes SMS service
operations to fail.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
