The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Dell OptiPlex XMT 5xx systems with BIOS rev. A09 and earlier support 1024x768
w/65535 colors at 75 Hz and lower. Dell OptiPlex XMT 5xx BIOS revisions A10 and
later only support 1024x768 w/65535 at 70 Hz and lower.

WORKAROUND
==========

If a customer requires a BIOS rev. of A10 or later, using a refresh rate of 70
Hz or lower with this screen resolution/color combination is currently the only
option. Otherwise, remaining at BIOS rev. A09 and earlier will allow the use of
the 75 Hz or lower refresh rate.

Customers should contact Dell technical support at (800)624-9896 for any further
BIOS updates regarding this problem.
