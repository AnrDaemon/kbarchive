PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 msphone1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Phone, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Speech Recognition tab in the Microsoft Voice Properties
dialog box and then click Advanced Settings, the Recognizer Settings Properties
dialog box appears. You cannot click the Microsoft Voice icon on the taskbar or
use the Microsoft Voice software until the Recognizer Settings Properties dialog
box is closed.

In addition, if you switch to another open window so that the Recognizer Settings
Properties dialog box is still visible, but is no longer the active window, you
cannot switch back to the Recognizer Settings Properties dialog box by clicking
the dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

When you click the Advanced Settings button on the Speech Recognition tab, the
speech recognition component of the Microsoft Voice software is started. This
prevents the Microsoft Voice software from accessing the speech recognition
component until the Recognizer Settings Properties dialog box is closed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To allow the Microsoft Voice software to function properly, close the Microsoft
Voice Properties dialog box. If the Microsoft Voice Properties dialog box is no
longer the active window, minimize or close other open windows until the
Microsoft Voice Properties dialog box becomes the active window.
