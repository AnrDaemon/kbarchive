You may need to remove a RAS port from service due to a problem such as
physical port or modem failure. Disabling the port prevents RAS clients
from dialing in to a bad port and suffering disconnections or lockups.
However, you may not have physical access to the server to be able to do
this interactively.  To disable a RAS port remotely:

1. From a remote computer, log into the RAS server with administrative
   privilege.

2. Connect to the C$ share on the RAS server.

3. Go into the %System Root%\SYSTEM32\RAS directory.

4. Backup the SERIAL.INI file as SERIAL.OLD. Edit the SERIAL.INI file as
   follows:

5. Locate the entry in the SERIAL.INI file that references the port to be
   disabled. For example: [COM1] or [COM2] and remove the entire section.

6. From Server Manager, stop and restart the RAS service.
