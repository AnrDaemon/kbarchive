SUMMARY
=======

You'll find a reference to a Rights.bak file in Chapter 8 of the Visual
SourceSafe Users Guide (available in Books Online under the Help menu) in the
"Backing Up and Restoring Visual SourceSafe" section. This reference states that
the Rights.bak file is an exact, up-to-date copy of the Rights.dat file and can
be simply renamed if the Rights.dat file is lost or corrupted.

However, a Rights.bak file does not get created in Visual SourceSafe 4.0. If the
Rights.dat file is corrupted or lost, ensure that Rights.dat is not in the DATA
directory, and run DDCONV from the command prompt as follows in order to create
a new Rights.dat:

   DDCONV <path to VSS\DATA directory>
