TITLE   :Slow Performance Across Token Ring Source Routers with NetBEUI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::1,2,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork osr1 osr2 win95kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Network performance may be slow when you are using programs that repeatedly
connect and disconnect from servers across a source routing bridge in a Token
Ring environment.

CAUSE
=====

When you are using the NetBEUI protocol on a Token Ring network, a NameQuery
packet is broadcast several times without the source routing field set. If there
is no response to half the possible name query requests, remaining requests are
resubmitted with the source routing field set. This behavior was designed to
reduce network traffic on the LAN. If a program repeatedly establishes
connections and disconnects from servers across a source routing bridge, network
performance is greatly reduced.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
