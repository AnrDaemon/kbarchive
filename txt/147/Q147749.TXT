TITLE   :BUG: Explicit-Shape Array Elements Not Displayed in Debugger
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you debug an explicit-shape character array in a subroutine and view the
expanded array elements in the locals, watch, or quickwatch window, only the
first two array elements contain values; the rest are blank.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can view the full contents of the array in the memory window. For more
information on using the memory window, please see the topic "Using the Memory
Window" in the Microsoft Fortran PowerStation version 4.0 Books Online help
facility.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Build the following sample code in Developer Studio. Begin debugging the program
by clicking Debug on the Build menu, and then click Step Into. Step into the
subroutine sub(), and go to the return statement. In either the watch or quick
watch window, type the explicit-shape array variable name "I" and then expand
the array elements by clicking the nesting symbol (+).

NOTE: All the array elements contain blank spaces except for the first two.

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile options needed: /Zi

         CHARACTER(LEN = 10),DIMENSION(8)::H
         H = 'AAAAAAAAAA'
         CALL SUB(H)
         WRITE(*,*)'Done debugging...'
         END

         SUBROUTINE SUB(I)
         CHARACTER(LEN = *),DIMENSION(8)::I
         I = 'BBBBBBBBBB'
         RETURN
         END SUBROUTINE SUB
