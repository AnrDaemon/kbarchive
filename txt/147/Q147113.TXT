TITLE   :XADM: Spaces Not Allowed in Some X.400 Entry Fields
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating a custom X.400 recipient, the following fields on the advanced
property page of the X.400 addressing page allow only for numerals 0 - 9. No
alphanumeric characters or spaces are allowed. The fields that are thus limited
are as follows:

   User Agent numeric ID (n-id)
   X.121 (x.121)
   Terminal Type (t-ty)

WORKAROUND
==========

The workaround is to remove the space from the desired user on the above fields
so that they match the Exchange format.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The X.400 specification allows for spaces in the above types, however, the
Microsoft Exchange addressing scheme (Address.dll) does not support spaces in
those three fields.

This can become a problem when creating custom recipients to X.400 system
recipients who follow this addressing scheme; it could result in a non- delivery
report (NDR) to such a user.
