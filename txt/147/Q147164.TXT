======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a NEC CDR-C251 MultiSpin 4-disc CD-ROM changer on a computer
running Windows 95, your computer may stop responding (hang) when you start
Windows 95, or the CD-ROM changer may continuously cycle through the discs in
the changer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Auto Insert Notification option is enabled in
Windows 95 and one or more of the CD-ROMs in the changer contains an Autorun.inf
file. The Autorun.inf file causes Windows 95 to try to start a program on the
CD-ROM.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, disable the Auto Insert Notification feature. To
do so, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click System.

2. On the Device Manager tab, double-click the CD-ROM branch, and then
   double-click NEC CDR-C251 CD-ROM.

3. On the Settings tab, click the Auto Insert Notification check box to clear
   it.

4. Click OK or Close until you return to Control Panel. When you are prompted to
   restart your computer, click Yes.

NOTE: All four of the CD-ROM drives associated with the NEC CDR-C251 CD-ROM
changer should be listed in Device Manager. The above procedure should be
repeated for each of the four CD-ROM drives.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the NEC CDR-C251 MultiSpin 4-disc CD-ROM changer on a computer
running Windows 95, all four drives may not be available in Windows 95 unless
you use the real-mode CD-ROM drivers included with the changer. The problem
described in this article is known to occur when the real-mode CD-ROM drivers
provided by NEC are used.
