SYMPTOMS
========

Hewlett-Packard (HP) Design Jet 650C prints large HPGL/2 files slowly.

CAUSE
=====

The following is an excerpt from the dj650c FAQ available on the HP WEB site:

   The HP Design Jet 650C plotter has an I/O limit of 10KB/sec when printing HP
   GL/2 files. When printing large files, ie: greater than physical RAM of the
   printing device, the I/O limit of the printer slows performance. Once the
   spooler has filled the maximum RAM on the printing device the I/O is limited
   to 10 KB/sec with HP GL/2 files and 60 KB/sec with HP RTL files.

The HP Design Jet 650C on-board RAM can be expanded to 68 MBs. Chips are
available in 4, 8, 16, and 32 MBs.

More information about the capabilities of the HP650c may be found on the
internet at the following World Wide Web site:
