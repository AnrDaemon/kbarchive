PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbpolicy win95kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks or the Microsoft
Service for NDS, a semicolon (;) in a SET statement in a NetWare login script
may be parsed as a character, rather than as a join parameter, by the login
script processor.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Novell login script processor requires a semicolon in SET statements to
concatenate an environment variable and a string. For example:

   set <a>=<b>;"text string"

If <b> = "this is a ", <a> is set to "this is a text string."

The Windows 95 login script processor would set <a> to "this is a ;text
string."

Additional query words: user system tree
