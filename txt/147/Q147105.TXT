TITLE   :XCLN: GAL Is Lost If the Exchange Server Is Shut Down
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The connection for the Global Address List is lost if the Microsoft Exchange
server is shut down while a client is in the Compose window.

WORKAROUND
==========

Exit and restart the client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange version
4.0 Windows 3.x, Windows 95, and Windows NT clients. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Personal Address Book aggressively tries to reconnect if it is disconnected
after previously connecting to the server. If the Personal Address Book fails
when initially asked for the hierarchy table, MAPI will not communicate with the
Personal Address Book again, eliminating the chance to reconnect.
