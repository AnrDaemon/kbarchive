SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT Server can create as many Macintosh volumes as you want, but there is
a limit on the client side that may cause connecting Macintosh computers to stop
responding if you exceed 50 volumes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On the AppleShare 4.x server, you are limited to creating 50 volumes, each of
whose names must contain 27 or fewer characters. The Macintosh finder was
engineered never to expect more total characters than this, and when the finder
looks for a server share, it allocates memory for a string that is 50x27
characters long. When the finder encounters a server whose shares have a total
string length greater than 50x27, this can cause the server to stop responding.

On a Windows NT server, you can successfully create and mount a few hundred
visible Macintosh volumes by giving the volumes very short names, such as A1,
A2, B1, B2, and so on. You can increase the number of volumes you can create by
minimizing the string length of the volume names.
