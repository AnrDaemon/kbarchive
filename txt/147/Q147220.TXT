PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a user mode application attempts to write to a NetWare 3.11 server, the
following STOP error message appears:

   STOP: 0x0000000A (0xFE826000, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0x804042A6)

NOTE: The first and fourth parameters, such as 0xFE826000 and 0x804042A6, are
specific to your system configuration.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you use the WriteFile() API on a file located on a
NetWare 3.11 server. This problem does not occur on NetWare 3.12 and higher
servers, which use burst mode writes by default.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, install the PBurst NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) to
enable burst mode writes on NetWare 3.11 servers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
