The NTFS file system stores permissions for files and directories as
attributes in the file system. Any installation of Windows NT on the local
computer has access to these files. Although each copy of Windows NT that
is running recognizes the permissions assigned in the file system, any user
who is a member of the local Administrators group in a Windows NT
installation can take ownership of files and access the data.

Although the NTFS file system offers more security features than FAT, a new
installation of Windows NT can be used to boot the system, if the primary
boot partition is NTFS. This allows the members of the Administrators group
full rights to all files in the NTFS partition.
