WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

PowerPoint 7.0 uses a key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER to find the translator for
converting files from previous versions. If a different user logs on, that user
has a different HKEY_CURRENT_USER profile and, therefore, that user doesn't have
the correct information to get to the key. PowerPoint 7.0b puts this key in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

Pure Black and White Print Command Added

install an optional add-in. There is a Print Pure Black and White check box in
the PowerPoint 7.0b Print dialog box.

PowerPoint Makes Read/Write Call to
Windows NT Registry; Violates C2 Security
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PowerPoint 7.0 tries to open some registry keys with read/write privileges, when
it needs only read access. Users may not have write access, which causes
PowerPoint to fail. PowerPoint 7.0b makes the registry call read-only.

Organization Chart Is Now Installed
with a Typical installation of Office
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you do a Typical or Compact installation of PowerPoint or Office, Microsoft
Organization Chart is not installed.

In Office 7.0b, Organization Chart is installed with the Typical installation.

Windows NT 4.0: PowerPoint Calls Iclose
on Something That Is Not a Valid File Handle
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you run a version of Windows NT later than 3.51, you may have trouble opening
or saving a presentation repeatedly, or you may have trouble adding images to
the ClipArt Gallery. This is because PowerPoint 7.0 makes a call to an invalid
file handle.

PowerPoint 7.0b makes the correct call.

Applying a Template Under Windows NT at
VGA (640x480x16) May Turn Slides Black
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This happens if your presentation contains a shaded fill.

This is fixed in the Far East versions of PowerPoint 7.0 and in PowerPoint 7.0b.

PowerPoint 7.0 Crashes on Bullet Font Mixed Selection
-----------------------------------------------------

PowerPoint 7.0 may crash if you click Bullets on the Format menu if you have two
or more paragraphs with different bullets selected. This has been fixed in
PowerPoint 7.0b.
