TITLE   :XCLN: Message Gets Deleted From Wrong Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If two Microsoft Exchange Inbox Assistant rules move a single message to two
different folders, the incorrect message may get deleted. This happens when only
one of the rules has an Alert action chosen to notify the user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This happens when two rules exist that move a message to different folders and
the first rule includes an alert action. If you read and delete the message from
within the alert box, the message will be deleted from the folder that the
second rule copied it to.

To avoid this, change the order of the rules so the rule that includes the alert
action is at the end of the list.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients
for Windows, version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Exchange Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
