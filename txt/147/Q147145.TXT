TITLE   :XCLN: Send from Excel/Word Hangs Client Until Message Sent
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Send option in either Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word, the
Microsoft Exchange Client will not be operational until the message is sent.

CAUSE
=====

These applications use the Simple MAPI command File Send to access mail. This
command is modal and therefore will not allow you to toggle back to use the
Microsoft Exchange Client until the message is sent.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

NOTE: You can create an additional (new) message prior to sending the Word or
Excel document, by choosing New Message on the Compose menu in Microsoft
Exchange.
