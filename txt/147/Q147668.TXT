TITLE   :PRB: Len and LenB May Differ on Size of User-Defined Types
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbVBp400 kb32bitOnly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When used with a user-defined type, the LenB function may return a different
value than the Len function on 32-bit Windows platforms. This behavior occurs
because the LenB function returns the in-memory size of a type, while the Len
function returns the amount of size that a UDT would take if stored on disk.
This occurs because Visual Basic 4.0 32-bit represents strings internally in
Unicode, but externally (on disk) as ANSI. A string in the two-byte Unicode
standard will occupy twice as much space as its ANSI equivalent.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The reproduction sample below demonstrates this behavior. Note that the
fixed-length string is what causes different values for Len and LenB. The
non-fixed-length string will always return a value of 4, because that is the
space required to store a pointer to the location where the actual string is
stored. The array of bytes of size five needs 5 bytes of storage, regardless of
the contents of the array.

Steps to Reproduce
------------------

1. Start a new Visual Basic 4.0 32-bit project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a single module to the project by selecting Module from the Insert menu.

3. Add this code to the General Declarations section of Module1:

         Type MyUDT
            x As String * 5      'size of 10 or 5
            y As String       'size of 4
            z (1 to 5) As Byte   'size of 5
         End Type

4. Add this code to the Form_Click event of Form1:

         Private Sub Form_Click()
            Dim test As MyUDT

            test.x = "hello"
            test.y = "world"
            test.z(1) = 64
            test.z(2) = 65
            test.z(3) = 66
            test.z(4) = 67

            Print LenB(test)     'returns 21
            Print Len(test)      'returns 14
         End Sub

5. Press the F5 key or select Start from the Run menu to run the application and
   observe the behavior.
