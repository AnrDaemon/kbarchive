-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The personal options (click Options on the Tools menu) are saved in a file named
<username>.vue. For Microsoft Windows version 3.x and Microsoft Windows
95, the file is stored in the WINDOWS directory, and for Microsoft Windows NT,
this file is stored in the WINNT35 directory, by default.

Users and administrators concerned about the security of the WINNT35 directory
have the ability to modify the registry and specify a different location for the
.vue file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

    Application:

For example, assume that Joe Smith has a user name of JSmith and his home
directory is mapped to the H: drive. Therefore, the following value could be
entered:

   OptionsFilePath=H:\jsmith\user.vue

As long as he has Change permissions for this directory, the preferences file can
be accessed and modified.
