TITLE   :Incorrect Output Printing Through Captured LPT Port to FPNW
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a NetWare client prints to an LPT port that is captured to a File and Print
Services for NetWare (FPNW) server, the output is incorrect. For example,
control codes (postscript codes) are also printed instead of it being processed
by the printer.

CAUSE
=====

The NetWare client sends the job to the FPNW server as a Text print job. FPNW
prints it as though it is plain text.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, add the /No Tabs (or /NT) switch to the end of the
Capture line.

   Sample usage:  CAPTURE QUEUE=fpnwqueue NOTABS
   Abbreviated:   CAPTURE Q=fpnwqueue NT

If your NetWare client runs in Windows, clear the Enable Tabs check box in the
LPT settings of NetWare User Tools. The NetWare client then sends the data to
the FPNW server as a byte stream print job.
