SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to migrate personal login scripts from a Novell
NetWare server to a computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server using the
Migration Tool for NetWare (Nwconv.exe). It also discusses how personal login
scripts can be implemented on an FPNW-enabled Windows NT server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use the Migration Tool for NetWare to migrate login scripts or the
information contained in a user's MAIL directory, from a NetWare server to an
FPNW-enabled Windows NT server computer, follow these steps:

1. Verify your selection of source and destination server in the Migration Tool
   for NetWare.

2. Click File Options, and then select the NetWare server's SYS volume.

3. Click Files, and then enable the transfer of the Mail subdirectory.

For clients who will be running logon scripts on the FPNW-enabled Windows NT
Server, the next step is to be sure that the corresponding user subdirectories
in the Mail folder were migrated to the same location (SYS volume and Mail
folder) of the Windows NT Server computer.

To find which subdirectory is associated with a user, go to User Manager for
Domains, open the User Properties, and click the NW Compatible button. The
resulting dialog box will include a user Object ID that corresponds to the
user's script directory in the Mail folder. The Edit Logon Script button will
modify the LOGON text file in the user's home directory.

If you need to create a system logon script, you will need to create and/or
modify the file Net$log.dat that will be found in the SYS:\PUBLIC directory.
During the logon process, the system logon script runs first followed by the
personal logon script.

For additional information about the migration of user and group data from a
Novell NetWare 4.x server, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base.
