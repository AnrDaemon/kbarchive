PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95

KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to an Epson Stylus printer, the Epson Spool Manager may stop
responding (hang), or you may receive the following error message:

   Error: Printer Not Responding

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you are using Epson's Stylus driver version 2.02E. In
some configurations (especially over a network), the Epson spooler may not be
able to communicate with the printer port.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the Epson Spool Manager to use Print Manager to spool print jobs
instead of using its internal spooler. For information about configuring the
Epson Spool Manager, please contact Epson.
