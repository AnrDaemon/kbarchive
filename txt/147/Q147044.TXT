======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up Microsoft Exchange to route Internet mail
to the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) and mail destined for
the AT&T Easylink gateway to the Microsoft Mail Connector.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up the above routing, the Microsoft Exchange Administrator needs to add
the following Address Space entries, using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program.

1. On the Address Space property page of the Internet Mail Connector Properties,
   click New Internet to add a new SMTP type address space entry. Type "*!*@*"
   (without the quotation marks) for the E-mail domain and set the cost to 1.
   Click New Internet to add a new SMTP type address space and leave the entry
   blank for the E-Mail domain and set the cost to 1. The IMC is not a UUCP
   gateway and therefore will not support '!' addressing, However, address in
   the type user!host@host is a valid SMTP address.

2. On the Address Space property page of the Microsoft Mail Connector
   Properties, click New Internet to add a new SMTP type address space entry.
   Type "*!*" (without the quotation marks) for the E-mail domain and set the
   cost to 2.

3. Stop and restart the Microsoft Exchange MTA, IMC and Microsoft Mail Connector
   services.

The above steps will cause all messages addressed to the AT&T Gateway to be
sent to the Microsoft Mail Connector. Messages addressed to all other addresses
of type "SMTP" will be sent out the IMC.

Results
-------

user!host!host!host ---> MS Mail Connector
user@host!host!host----> MS Mail Connector
user!host@host---------> Internet Mail Connector
user@host--------------> Internet Mail Connector

NOTE: Please refer to the Microsoft Exchange Administrator's Guide for more
information on setting up the AT&T Easylink gateway to provide service
between Microsoft Exchange Server and the AT&T system.
