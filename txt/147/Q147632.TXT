SYMPTOMS

Using the shortcut key to jump to the definition of a template function places
the cursor at the first use of the function (its instantiation).

No function definition for a template function appears in the browse Definitions
and References dialog box, only function references.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Press F12 (F11 using Visual C++ 2.0 key mapping) to jump to the definition of
the function. Instead of going to the definition of the function, you will be
taken back to the point where the function was instantiated (that is, the first
place the function was used).

Press ALT+F12 (CTRL+F11 using Visual C++ 2.0 key mapping) or select Browse from
the Tools menu. Type the name of your template function in the Browse window,
select Definitions and References from the list, and click OK. You will see
there is no entry in the Definitions and References box under Definitions.
