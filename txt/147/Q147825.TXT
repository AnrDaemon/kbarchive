TITLE   :RAS Server Does Not Autodisconnect If NetBIOS Gateway Disabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SYMPTOMS
========

Your Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 Remote Access (RAS) server does not disconnect
inactive RAS clients that dial in using the NetBEUI protocol. This problem
occurs even though you have configured the AutoDisconnect parameter in the
registry under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under the following subkey:

\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RemoteAccess\Parameters

If you dial into your Windows NT RAS server without the NetBEUI protocol,
inactive RAS clients are disconnected properly.

CAUSE
=====

The AutoDisconnect parameter for RAS does not function properly if the RAS
NetBIOS Gateway is disabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable the RAS NetBIOS Gateway, perform the following steps:

1. Run the Network applet in Control Panel.

2. Select Remote Access Service from the list of installed network software.

3. Choose the Configure button.

4. Choose the Network button.

5. In the Server Settings section, choose NetBEUI and then choose Configure for
   NetBEUI.

6. Enable the Entire Network radio button and choose OK twice.

7. Choose Continue and follow the prompts that appear for installing NetBEUI.
   (This prompt occurs only if NetBEUI is not already installed.)

8. Choose OK in the Network Settings dialog box and shut down Windows NT when
   prompted and reboot.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
