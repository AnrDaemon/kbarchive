SYMPTOMS
========

When you use System Agent to schedule an MS-DOS-based program that is configured
to run in MS-DOS mode, System Agent runs the program successfully, but may run
the program again after you quit the program and return to Windows 95. If the
program's shortcut is configured so that you are not warned before Windows 95
restarts in MS-DOS mode, it may appear that there is no way to stop the program
from running every time you restart Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

When System Agent runs an MS-DOS-based program in MS-DOS mode, it is unable to
detect that the program has finished running after you quit the program and
return to Windows 95. Because System Agent does not know that the program has
already been run successfully, it runs the program again.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the shortcut for the MS-DOS-based program is configured so that you are
warned before Windows 95 restarts in MS-DOS mode, the following message is
displayed before Windows 95 restarts in MS-DOS mode and the MS-DOS-based program
is run:

   This program is set to run in MS-DOS mode and cannot run while other
   programs are running. All other programs will close if you choose to
   continue.

   Do you want to continue?

To stop the MS-DOS-based program from running every time you restart Windows 95,
click No. If the shortcut for the program is configured so that you are not
warned before Windows 95 restarts in MS-DOS mode, start Windows 95 in Safe mode
and use System Agent to disable the program. To do so, follow these steps:

1. When Windows 95 restarts after you quit the MS-DOS-based program, press the
   F8 key when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, and then choose Safe
   Mode from the Startup menu.

   NOTE: If you do not see the "Starting Windows 95" message after you quit the
   MS-DOS-based program, restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE,
   using the computer's reset button, or turning the computer off and then back
   on. To minimize the risk of data loss, you should not restart the computer
   while the hard disk light indicates that the drive is being accessed.

2. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
   System Tools, and then click System Agent.

3. Click the MS-DOS-based program in the list of scheduled programs, and then
   click Disable on the Program menu.

4. Close System Agent and then restart Windows 95 normally.

Once you have stopped the MS-DOS-based program from running every time you
restart Windows 95, you can configure System Agent to prevent this behavior from
occurring again. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
   System Tools, and then click System Agent.

2. Click the MS-DOS-based program in the list of scheduled programs, and then
   click Change Schedule on the Program menu. In the Start At box, note the time
   at which the program is scheduled to be run.

3. Click Advanced.

4. Click the "If the program is still running, stop it at this time" check box
   to select it.

5. In the Deadline box, type the time you noted in step 2 plus one minute. For
   example, if the program is scheduled to start at 5:00 P.M., type "5:01 PM"
   (without the quotation marks) in the Deadline box.

6. Click OK, and then close System Agent.
