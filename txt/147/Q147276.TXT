The information in this article applies to:

 - Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Human Body for Windows, version 1.0

SUMMARY
=======

If you have installed one of the products listed above from a multiple CD-ROM
changer, you may have problems accessing the CD-ROM drive where the disk is
located. This occurs when the disk is inserted in a drive different from the one
from which the program was installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

The program attempts to access and run from the CD-ROM drive you used for
installation. If you want to run the program from a different CD-ROM drive, you
must make a change to the drive designation in the Band.ini file for the
program.

To change the drive designation, use the instructions below for your version of
Magic School Bus.

MSB Human
---------

1. If you're using Windows 95/98, in Windows Explorer, open the MSKids\MSBHuman
   folder.

   If you're using Windows 3.x, in File Manager, open the MSKids\MSBHuman folder.

2. Double-click the Band.ini file to open it in Notepad.

3. You should see entries similar to the following:

         [init]
         main=!D:\msbhuman\ (where D: represents the CD-ROM drive)
         second=!c:\mskids\msbhuman
         user=&c:\mskids\msbhuman
         syscaps=35

         [info]
         pid=25252-G90-8546345

4. On the line where "D" represents the CD-ROM drive letter, change "D" to the
   drive letter that matches where you have inserted the MSB Human Body compact
   disc.

   For example, if you have inserted the compact disc into drive G, change the
   line from

   main=!D:\msbhuman\

   to

   main=!G:\msbhuman\

5. On the File menu, click Save.

MSB Human Body should now function successfully in your multiple CD-ROM changer.

MSB Ocean
---------

1. If you're using Windows 95/98, in Windows Explorer, open the
   MSKids\MSBOcean\System folder.

   If you're using Windows 3.x, in File Manager, open the MSKids\MSBOcean\System
   folder.

2. Double-click the Band.ini file to open it in Notepad.

3. You should see entries similar to the following:

         [init]
         main=>C:\MSKids\MSBOcean\System\FC\;!C:\MSKids\MSBOcean\System\;!D:
           \MSBOcean\;
         user=>C:\MSKids\MSBOcean\System\ 
         syscaps=2
         minimize=1
         [info]
         pid=36506-442-2873026

4. On the line where "D" represents the CD-ROM drive letter, change "D" to the
   drive letter that matches where you have inserted the MSB Ocean compact
   disc.

   For example, if you have inserted the compact disc into drive G, change the
   line from

   main=>C:\MSKids\MSBOcean\System\FC\;!C:\MSKids\MSBOcean\System\;!D:
   \MSBOcean\;

   to

   main=>C:\MSKids\MSBOcean\System\FC\;!C:\MSKids\MSBOcean\System\;!G:
   \MSBOcean\;

MSB Inside the Earth

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
   require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
   resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be resolved. Use
   Registry Editor at your own risk.

   For information about how to edit the registry, use the on-line Help in
   Registry Editor, then go to the Changing Keys And Values Help topic. You

   For example, if you have inserted the compact disc into drive G, change the
   line from:

   main=>C:\MSKids\MSBEarth\System\FC\;!C:\MSKids\MSBEarth\System\;!D:
   \MSBEarth\System\;

   to
