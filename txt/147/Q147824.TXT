SUMMARY
=======

Directory Replication is the duplication of a master set of directories from the
export server to the import computer in the same or other domains. Each export
server maintains a list of computers and/or domain names to which subdirectories
are exported and each import computer maintains a list of computers and/or
domain names from which subdirectories are imported.

During directory replication, the export server initializes the session with the
import server. The export server then replicates all new file and directory
information from the export directory to the import computer's import directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Import directories are overwritten each time replication occurs and because of
this, it is recommended that replication be used for read-only information.

The export server must be running Windows NT Server. The default export path is
located under <winnt_root>\System32\Repl\Export shared as Repl$.

The import computer can be Windows NT domain controllers and servers, Windows NT
Workstations, Windows NT 3.1, Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server and Microsoft
Lanmanager OS/2 Servers and OS/2 peer servers. The default import directory is
<winnt_root>\System32\Repl\Import.

There are two directory replication parameters that can only be configured in the
registry of the export computer under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\
CurrentControlSet\Services\Replicator\Parameters.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

The first entry is Interval (REG_DWORD). This parameter determines how often an
export server checks the replicated directories for changes. The second
parameter is GuardTime (REG_DWORD). This parameter sets the number of minutes an
export directory must be stable before it will be replicated.
