TITLE   :Intermittent Replication Between WINS Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) replication between partners is
intermittent and unpredictable.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the Replication Options are not configured correctly for
each of the replication partners. In the Push Partner Properties dialog box, if
Update Count is blank it defaults to 20 (minimum). However, if the Replication
Interval in the Pull Partner Properties is left blank, it defaults to 0 (zero).
Therefore, the WINS server does not pull records from the WINS partner at a
regular interval. Records will be pulled only once during start up.

If the Start Time is left blank records will be pulled beginning at startup and
then continue at the configured Replication Interval.


RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure you enter a specific value for the Replication Interval when you
configure WINS Replication Partners.
