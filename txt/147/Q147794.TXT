SUMMARY
=======

When you implement dial-in security, the Remote Access Admin utility sets
dial-in permissions on a global, per domain basis. There are no settings to
implement security on a server by server basis in the Remote Access Admin
Utility. However, you can set the Per server security by allowing or denying the
"Access this computer from network" user right in User Manager.

NOTE: A user that does not have the "Access this computer from the network" user
right cannot access the computer for other purposes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To implement dial-in security on a per server basis:

1. Determine which users are to dial in to which RAS servers

2. On each RAS server, assign the "Access this computer from network" user right
   only to the users who should have access to that specific server.

3. Make sure you disable the "Access this computer from network" user right for
   the users who should not have access to the RAS server.

4. Grant dial-in permissions to all dial-in users in Remote Access Admin.
