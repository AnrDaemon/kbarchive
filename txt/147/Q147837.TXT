======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible to check out an entire project and its subprojects, recursively.
The project structure can be preserved by using the "Build tree (override
working dirs)" option in the Check Out dialog. If, however, one of the
subprojects has a working directory set, SourceSafe will look in this working
directory when checking in the projects. If the working directory is not the
same as the directory structure which was created during the recursive checkout,
a "File not Found" error will occur for each file in the subproject.

CAUSE
=====

SourceSafe looks in the project's working directory for the files to check in
rather than the check out directory.

NOTE: From the command line, files can only be checked in from the working
directory. In the interface, files may be checked in from the check out
directory if the "Override working dirs" option is used.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you don't know if working directories have been set for subordinate projects,
use the "Override working dirs" option on the Check In dialog.

Another option to avoid the error is to use the "Undo Check Out..." option.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. This problem was corrected in Visual SourceSafe
version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Main project with several subprojects and associated files.

2. Set a working directory for one of the subprojects to something other than
   what will be used for the Main project.

3. Check out the Main project recursively, and choose the "Build tree (override
   working dirs)" option.

4. Check the Main project in recursively. The error will occur.
