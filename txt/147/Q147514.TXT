======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When SNA Server is configured with one or more 802.2 Token Ring or Ethernet
connections on Windows NT 3.51 (or 3.51 Service Pack 1-4), the following
problems can occur:

 - When you stop SNA Server, the SNA Server Admin program shows the server in a
   perpetual "Stopping" state. If you issue the NET START command, the command
   shows the SNA Server service as stopped, though one or more 802.2 link
   services (SNADLC1, SNADLC2, ...) are still started.

 - If you stop an 802.2 connection or and 802.2 connection fails, the connection
   may be stuck in an "Inactive" state and it is not possible to restart it
   using SNA Server Admin.

CAUSE
=====

During connection shutdown, the SNA Server 802.2 link service issues commands
(such as DIR_READ_LOG or DLC_CLOSE_STATION) to the Windows NT DLC.SYS driver
which never complete, causing the link service to fail to respond to the SNA
Server Close(Link) request.

While processing these commands, the Windows NT DLC driver is waiting on a
response from the underlying NDIS miniport driver. However, the Windows NT
NDIS.SYS wrapper request handler is not properly processing requests from the
transport driver in some cases, causing an NDIS command to fail to complete.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
3.51 Service Pack 4. This problem was first corrected in Microsoft Windows NT
version 3.51 Service Pack 1. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
