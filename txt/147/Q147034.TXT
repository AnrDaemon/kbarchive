TITLE   :XCLN: First Line of Inbox Message Body May Be Missing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you display a message in the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client Inbox
ReadNote form, the first line of message body may be missing. This can occur on
messages received through Innosoft's PMDF SMTP Gateway version 5.04. This same
message will be displayed if read with version 3.x of Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks MS-DOS or version 3.x of Microsoft Mail for Windows.

CAUSE
=====

The specified number of lines in the message header is incorrect. This results
in the first line of the message body being put into the header and thus it is
not displayed in the message body.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an SMTP message arrives in the gateway, it is converted from SMTP
formatting conventions into Extended Microsoft Mail File Format (Extended MMFF).
One of the optional extended fields in this format defines the number of lines
that are in the header. This field is calculated incorrectly.

Below is a partial example of extended MMFF formatting:

Header field<         EXT:I:3:HEADLEN
Header line count<    9
                      TEXT:340
HeaderLine#1<         FROM:    SMTP:WAMOZART@tinpanalley.com
           2<
           3<         TO:      CSI:MUSIC/BLUEGRASS/JDOUGLAS
           4<
           5<         SUBJECT: This is the Subject Line
           6<
           7<         ----------------------------------------------------
           8<
           9<<<       This is the first line of the Body of Text.
           10         This is the second line of the Body of Text.
           11         This is the third and last line of the Body of Text.

As indicated in the above example, the HEADLEN (header length) field specifies
that the header is 9 lines. The ninth line is the first line of the body of the
message, therefore, it does not display in the body of the message. The correct
line count for the header should be 8 (or even 7).

The MSMail DOS and MSMail Windows 3.x clients ignore this field if it exists. The
Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 Inbox, when configured using the Microsoft Mail
provider, keys on this field's value to determine the end of the
header\beginning of the message body.

File Format API for Gateways and Applications guide from the Microsoft Mail
Software Development Kit.
