PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0; winnt:1.2,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Get Temporary Filename script item, the variable that is
returned does not contain the full path, it contains only the file name.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, obtain the latest version of Microsoft Systems
Management Server Installer from the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/downloads/

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 1.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Get Temporary Filename script item is used to obtain a unique temporary file
name used during installation. These file names are often used to provide names
for support .dll files that are not needed after the installation is complete.

A script example and its results:

   item: Get Temporary Filename
     Variable=TFILE
   end
   item: Display Message
     Title=tfile
     Text=%tfile%
     Flags=00000100
   end

The above script may produce a file name, such as "GLF18A.TMP," rather than the
expected full path and file name.
