In Systems Management Server 2.0, you can configure Client Agent Messages. Some

MORE INFORMATION
================

To locate the Client Agents, do the following:

1. Open the SMS Administrator console and expand Site Database.

2. Expand Site and then Site Settings.

3. The Client Agents are located under Site Settings.

Remote Tools
------------

To configure the Remote Tools Client Agent messages:

1. Right-click Remote Tools Client Agent, then click Properties. There are five
   tabs: General, Security, Policy, Notifications, and Advanced.

2. If the Remote Tools Client Agent will be installed on the client computer,
   click the General tab and select the Enable check box.

3. To suppress messages, click the Policy tab and select Do Not Ask For
   Permission as the Access Permission setting.

4. The Notification tab has settings for Display A Visual Indicator and Play A
   Sound. To suppress messages at the client computer, clear the Display A
   Visual Indicator check box. To suppress sounds at the client, clear the Play
   A Sound check box.

Advertised Programs
-------------------

To configure the Advertised Program Client Agent messages:

1. Right-click Advertised Programs Client Agent, then click Properties. There
   are two tabs, General and Notification.

2. If the Advertised Programs Client Agent will be installed on the client
   computer, click the General tab and select the Enable check box.

3. To suppress messages at the client, click the Notification tab and clear the
   check box for each of the three options displayed:

    - When new advertised programs are available
    - When a scheduled program is about to run
    - Show status icon on taskbar or desktop for all system activity

Software Metering

To configure the Software Metering Client Agent messages:

1. Right-click Software Metering Client Agent, then select Properties. There are
   five tabs: General, Timings, Checked Out, Denials, and Inactivity.

2. If the Software Metering Client Agent will be installed on the client
   computer, click the General tab and select the Enable check box.

3. The Checked out, Denials, and Inactivity tab messages cannot be silenced.
   However, an administrator can customize the messages.

NOTE: Software Inventory Client Agent and Hardware Inventory Client Agent do not
display any messages (though some users might infer from disk activity that a
process is running on their computers).
