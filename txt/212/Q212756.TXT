-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user sends mail, the user may receive the following non-delivery report
(NDR):

   Recipient's Inbox does not exist or is busy

CAUSE
=====

This NDR can occur if two people send mail to the same user at the same time, or
if the recipient's .MBG or .KEY files have been cached in an open state. It can
also occur if one or more mailbags are missing, corrupted, or locked open. Make
sure that the mailbags exist, are not corrupted (check size), and are not
locked.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue if the sender and recipient are on the same postoffice,
make sure that the .KEY and .MBG files for the recipient's mailbag are not
locked open. If the mailbag is missing or corrupted, recreate the mailbag. For
additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q104279 PC DB: Creating or Resetting a .KEY and .MBG Pair

If the mailbag is locked, remove the lock from the server.

To resolve this issue if the sender and recipient are on different postoffices
(postoffice A and postoffice B, respectively) and the NDR is returned
immediately, check the outbound mailbag for postoffice B on postoffice A. If the
NDR is returned after a few minutes, check recipient's mailbag on postoffice B.
If the mailbag is missing or corrupted, recreate the mailbag. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q104279 PC DB: Creating or Resetting a .KEY and .MBG Pair

If the mailbag is locked, remove the lock from the server.

WORKAROUND
==========

If this behavior occurs infrequently, it should not be a problem. To work around
this issue, check LISTUSER.EXE (click on the link below) to determine what
hexadecimal numbered .MBG and .KEY files belong to whom. With this information,
you can find out who or what is locking the recipient's .MBG or .KEY files.
