======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use he Systems Management Server Installer to install a Microsoft
Management Console (MMC) snap-in on target computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An MMC snap-in is actually a dynamic-link library (DLL) that extends the
functionality of the MMC console. MMC DLLs must be installed and registered on
computers on which the snap-ins will be used. The Systems Management Server
Installer script item "Install MMC Snap-in" carries out the installation and
registration process as a part of the package execution.

Steps to Install an MMC Snap-In
-------------------------------

1. Install and start Systems Management Server Installer.

2. Create a new installation script.

3. Click View, and then click Script Editor.

4. Place the cursor in the section of code where files are being installed.

5. In the left pane in the Action box, double-click Install MMC Snap-in.

6. In the Source Pathname box, type the path and file name of the MMC DLL that
   you are distributing.

7. In the Copy Description box, type text that will display as the file is being
   installed on the target computer.

8. Click OK.

Results: The MMC DLL will be compressed into a Systems Management Server
self-extracting executable. When the executable is run on target computers, the
MMC DLL will be placed in the %Systemroot%\System32 folder and then registered
as an MMC DLL. The MMC snap-in will then be available on the target computer.
