TITLE   :SMS: Deleting an Object Does Not Delete Class Permissions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you delete an object, this does not delete the class security rights
(permissions) associated with the object.


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you are creating packages while logged on as a user
with permissions equivalent to a Domain Administrator, but not those of a Local
Administrator.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create the package while you are logged on as the
Local Administrator. No separate class permissions are created for that package.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.
