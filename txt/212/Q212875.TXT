======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) Installer version 2.0, a repackaged
installation does not work correctly when you create it on a Novell server in a
shared directory whose name contains a space.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because long file-name capability must be enabled on the
reference and target computers that you are using; otherwise, a space in the
directory name causes the repackage process to not complete successfully. Even
though SMS supports long file names, the file systems that it interacts with
must support them as well.
