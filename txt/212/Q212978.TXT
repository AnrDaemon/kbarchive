SUMMARY
=======

This article describes Preinst.exe for Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0. You
can find this tool in the Support folder on the SMS CD-ROM, or in the System
Management Server 2.0 Resource Guide included with Microsoft BackOffice Resource
Kit 4.5. This article supplements the information contained in the System
Management Server 2.0 Resource Guide.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Preinst.exe is a supplemental tool that you can use to manage site hierarchy,
primarily between parent and child SMS 2.0 sites.

You can run Preinst.exe with the following eight command-line switches:

 - /deinstall:<sitecode>
   Starts an uninstallation of a specified child site, and removes the child site
   from the parent's database.

 - /deljob:<sitecode>
   Deletes all jobs destined for the specified site. This switch deletes the .job
   files in the Sms\Inboxes\Schedule.box folder, the associated .p and .i files
   in the Sms\Inboxes\Schedule.box\ToSend folder, and the associated .srq or
   .srs files in the Sms\Inboxes\Schedule.box\Outboxes\<sender> and
   Sms\Inboxes\Schedule.box\Requests folders.

 - /delsite:{sitecode,parentsite}
   Deletes the specified child site from the database where it is run. This
   switch also deletes all jobs destined for the child site. This switch does
   not uninstall the secondary site.

 - /dump
   You can only run this switch on a primary site server. The switch writes out
   copies of the site control files for the site where it is run and its child
   sites.

 - /stopsite
   Stops all SMS Server services on the site where it is run. This switch also
   stops SMS services on remote Client Access Point (CAP) servers for the site.
   This switch does not affect the local Logon Point service
   (SMS_NT_Logon_Discovery_Agent) if the site server is running on a domain
   controller, nor does it affect remote logon point servers.

 - /syncchild:<sitecode>
   This switch is similar to attaching a child site to its parent. The parent
   site sends all configuration information (for example, advertisements and
   collections) to the specified child site.


 - /syncparent
   Causes the current site and all its child sites to send site control files to
   their parent sites.

 - /upgrade:<sitecode>
   Performs a push install to upgrade the designated secondary site. This switch
   uses the existing versions of the primary site server's files.
