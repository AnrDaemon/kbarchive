The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When using the Insert Line into Text File, Add to Autoexec.bat, or Add to
Config.sys script items and setting the insert action within the script item
dialog to Replace Line Containing Text, the comment text specified is not
inserted into the target file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This action is by design. When using the Replace Line Containing text insert
action for the Insert Line Into Text File script item or any other script items
that uses the same interface such as Add to Autoexec.bat or Add to Config.sys,
the Replace Line Containing Text insert action does not preserve the previous
line. Thus, there is nothing to comment.

To have lines inserted while maintaining the replaced lines in the file as
comments, use the Insert Before Line Containing Text or Insert After Line
Containing Text insert actions. These actions will prepend the previous line
with the comment text specified in the script item and then insert the new line
accordingly.
