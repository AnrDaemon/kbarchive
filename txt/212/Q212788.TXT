TITLE   :XFOR: Connector for cc:Mail Stops, No Errors Appear in Event Log
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail may stop unexpectedly. No
errors appear in the Windows NT Application Event log, even with maximum logging
enabled. If you restart the connector, it may start delivering messages again
for a short period of time, but then stop delivering messages.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when one or more .und files exist in the
Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Import or Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Export folder. These files are
associated with messages that could not be delivered when they were originally
sent.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove the .und files associated with the undeliverable
e-mail messages. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Stop the Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, if it is started.

2. Copy the .und files from the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Import or
   Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Export folder to a different folder, and then delete the
   .und files in the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Import or Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Export
   folder.

3. Restart the Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail.

The connector should then start delivering messages again.
