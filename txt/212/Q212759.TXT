TITLE   :XFOR: CCMC Event 54 Conversion of Message Failed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mail may stop flowing over the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail
(CCMC), and the following event message may be received every 15 seconds in the
application event log:

   Event ID 54 "Conversion of Message Failed"

Moreover, Exchange Server may keep adding the same message, with a new file name
(such as Msg3DFF.ccm), to the <drive>:\Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Bad folder. There
is nothing added to the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Export or Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Submit
folders, however.

CAUSE
=====

A corrupted message in the cc:Mail PostOffice is preventing mail flow.

WORKAROUND
==========

The cc:Mail administrator needs to delete the corrupted message for mail to
resume flowing normally. Here are the steps the cc:Mail administrator needs to
perform on the cc:Mail PostOffice:

1. Stop the cc:Mail connector service.

2. Clean out the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Bad folder.

3. Run Export.exe manually on the Exchange Server computer (at a command prompt)
   with the following syntax:

   EXPORT /NpoName (Exchange site name) /Ppassword /DE:\ccdata /MSG#
   /@filename.txt.

   For example:

   EXPORT /NEX1 /Ppassword /DE:\ccdata /MSG# /@ccmessg.txt

   NOTE: /N is usually the Exchange Server Site name (check the cc:Mail Admin.exe
   to be sure of the Exchange Server postoffice name).

   /MSG# gives the message number.

   /@filename.txt creates a text file that shows all of the messages outgoing
   from cc:Mail to Exchange Server. Compare these messages to the one in
   Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Bad, and locate the corrupted message and its message
   number (MSG#) shown in the text file.

4. Run the export again with the following switches:

   EXPORT /Nponame (exchange site) /Ppassword /DD:\ccdata /DELETE/123456
   (message number)

   For example:

   EXPORT /NEX1 /Ppassword /DD:\ccdata /DELETE/123456

5. Restart the cc:Mail service. Mail flows, and there are no further errors.
