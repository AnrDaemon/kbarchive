KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbClient kbRemote kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Client computers running Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 and
Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 with Service Pack 3 (SP3) installed may
receive the following General Protection Fault (GPF) error message in WUSER32:

   Initialization of the dynamic link library C:\WINNT40\System32\CRYPT32.dll
   failed. The process is terminating abnormally.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Crypt32.dll file in Windows NT 4.0 SP3
contains a subtle memory leak that eventually becomes apparent if it is loaded
and unloaded constantly. This leak occurs because Transport Layer Security (TLS)
is allocated when Crypt32.dll is loaded, but it is not freed when the DLL is
unloaded.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this issue, apply an updated version of Crypt32.dll. This can be done
either by upgrading the client computer to Windows NT 4.0 SP4, or by replacing
the Crypt32.dll file with the newer version from Windows NT 4.0 SP4.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Windows NT 4.0 SP4.
