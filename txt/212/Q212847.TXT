TITLE   :SMS: Aborted SMS Installer Installation Requests a Restart
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbClient kbsms200 kbPackage kbsmsInst kbsmsUtil

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer executable is aborted
during execution, the Installer program requests a restart.

CAUSE
=====

Files still in use cannot be returned to the pre-installed state until the
computer is restarted. The restart is automatically requested so that any
temporary files in the destination directory can be renamed back to their
original file names.

WORKAROUND
==========

The RESTART variable in the Installer script can be altered to suppress a
restart message.
