======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you are troubleshooting a Defense Message System (DMS)-enabled Exchange
Server computer and you require a hotfix, you cannot implement the hotfix, in
accordance with DMS Interim Procedure 5-V01, without the permission of::

 - Global System Manager (GSM), DISA

 - X.500: US/U.S. Government/DoD/DISA/Organizations/Org Staff/Ops (n)/DMS GSM(n)

 - SMTP: dmsgsm@ncr.disa.mil

MORE INFORMATION
================

DMS has a specific version number that corresponds to Exchange Server releases.
The current version and next release are as follows:

 - DMS 2.1 (current version), which includes Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2,
   Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, and Microsoft Outlook 98

 - DMS 2.2 (Current version), which includes Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3,
   Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5, and Outlook 2000.

These are the most recent DMS certified release packages; any hotfixes that are
required need to be approved by the authorities above. Note that there are
previous versions of DMS that are based on Exchange Server 5.0. Although they
are not listed above, any hotfixes that are required for them must follow the
same approval process that the current versions do.

You must have the contact information for the PMO for your specific service. If
you install a hotfix, you are no longer running a "certified" version of DMS.
After the hotfix is "certified" by LMFS, or if you have the permission of LMFS
or the PMO, you can install the hotfix.
