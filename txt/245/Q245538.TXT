MORE INFORMATION
================

The Remote Command Service (Rcmd.exe) provides a secure, stable way to remotely
administer and run command-line programs.

The Remote Command Service consists of client and server components. The client
component is a command-line program, Rcmd.exe. The server component,
Rcmdsvc.exe, is installed and run as a service. That is, you can stop and start
it remotely through the Control Panel Network application or locally through the
net start and net stop commands. Because it is a service, it runs whenever the
system is running if you configure it for automatic startup, whether or not a
user is locally logged on.

A client connection to the server creates a command session, or 'virtual
console'. It is not visible on the desktop and does not in any way interfere
with it. Up to 10 clients can be simultaneously connected to the remote command
server on a computer, all operating securely and independently of each other.

For more information on the Remote Command Service and its use, please consult
the Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit documentation.
