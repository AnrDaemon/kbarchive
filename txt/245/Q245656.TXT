The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server, version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to obtain Cluster Automation Server for Windows NT
4.0 and Windows 2000. Cluster Automation Server (CAS) is a set of ActiveX
objects that can be used from scripting languages and Visual Basic to query and
control a Cluster programmatically. CAS ships in the form of Msclus.dll.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two versions of CAS:

 - A Windows NT 4.0 version
 - A more feature-rich version for Windows 2000

The Windows NT 4.0 version of CAS can be obtained from the Platform SDK that
ships with Windows 2000 under the Redist\Cluster\NT4\i386 (or alpha) directory.
Please read the Readme.txt file in that directory before installing the DLL.

NOTE: A copy of Atl.dll may need to be added to your system. For a list of
Microsoft applications that Atl.dll ships with, please refer to the following
Web site:

   Microsoft File Version Information Center

CAS is installed by default in Windows 2000. No additional actions need to be
taken. The DLL is also available in the Windows 2000 Admin Pack.
