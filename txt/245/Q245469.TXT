   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

As a Domain Name System (DNS) server performs name resolution for a name query,
it caches a copy of the data. This is retained for the time period specified by
the Time To Live (TTL) value. By default, the data is kept in memory until the
TTL time period has expired, DNS has been stopped, or the MaxCacheTtl value on
the DNS server has expired, whichever occurs first.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To prevent a Microsoft DNS server from caching records from recursive queries:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following value:

   Value: MaxCacheTtl
   Data Type: DWORD
   Data value: 0

4. Click OK.

5. Quit Registry Editor.

6. Restart the DNS server.
