TITLE   :Err Msg: STOP 0xC0000263 Driver Entry Point Not Found.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start a computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, you
may receive the following error message:

   STOP 0xC0000263 Driver Entry Point Not Found
   \SystemRoot\system32\drivers\driver name

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there is a version mismatch between the driver that
is attempting to load and the Windows NT kernel, or if the driver is damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install a parallel installation of Windows NT Server 4.0,
and then copy the driver from the parallel installation to the original Windows
NT installation, or use an Emergency Repair Disk (ERD) to restore the system
files of the original installation.

IMPORTANT: If you use an ERD to restore the original files, replace only the
system files. Do not replace any portion of the registry during the emergency
repair process.

For additional information about using an ERD, please see the following articles
