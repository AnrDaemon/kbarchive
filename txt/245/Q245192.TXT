TITLE   :Blank Logon Dialog Box Appears After You Change Drive Letter.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you restart a computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, and then
press CTRL+ALT+Delete to log on to the computer, you may receive a blank dialog
box.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you install a new hard disk on your computer and
change the drive letter of the hard disk, and the Winlogon.exe, Samsrv.dll, or
Samlib.dll files are damaged, or the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database is
damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use an Emergency Repair Disk (ERD) to restore the damaged
system files, and then restore the SAM and Security registry hives from the most
recent tape backup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Though restoring the registry hives from the most recent tape backup is the
preferred method, you can also restore the SAM and Security registry hives from
the ERD.

CAUTION: The ERD method restores the hives only to how they were when you created
the ERD. All the user account and user group information is lost. Updating an
ERD does not update the SAM and Security hives.

For more information about updating the SAM and Security hives, please refer to
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
