SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to print a document from an MS-DOS-based program to a
printer connected to another workstation on the network. Because MS-DOS-based
programs support ports LPT1 through LPT3, you can redirect print jobs on port
LPT2 to the network printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

At the command prompt, type the following line

   NET USE LPT2: \\computer name\share name of printer

where computer name is the name of the print server, and share name of printer is
the name of the printer share.

When you print a document from an MS-DOS-based program to port LPT1, the document
is printed to the local printer attached to the computer. If you type the
command 'NET USE LPT2: \\SHOP2\EPSONLQ' and then print a document to port LPT2,
the document is redirected over the network to the Epson printer attached to the
SHOP2 server.

NET USE redirections are stored in the registry by user, not by computer.
Therefore, each user who wants to send documents to a printer attached to
another workstation on the network needs to issue this command.
