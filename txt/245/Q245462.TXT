TITLE   :Inserting an Excel Worksheet Object May Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The insert object function of a container program may not work if the server
program takes a long time to load. For example, if the automatic save feature in
Microsoft Excel is turned on and you attempt to insert an Excel spreadsheet into
a Microsoft PowerPoint document, any of the following error messages may occur:

   Sorry, the source application is busy and cannot respond immediately. You can
   switch to the other application and try to resolve the problem.

   -or-

   The Server application, source file, or item cannot be found. You should
   reinstall the server application.

   -or-

   The Server Application, source file, or item cannot be found. Make sure the
   Application is properly installed and that it has not been deleted, moved, or
   renamed.

CAUSE
=====

Excel takes more time to load when the automatic save add-in is enabled. The
load delay in Excel results in RPC_E_SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER being returned.
Windows NT is not properly handling the retry mechanism for OLE and therefore
RPC_E_CALL_REJECTED is returned. This causes the operation to not succeed.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.
