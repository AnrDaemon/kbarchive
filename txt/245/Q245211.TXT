If you perform an incremental backup of Exchange Server on the second node of a
cluster server, the incremental backup may not work and the following error
message may be generated:

   Event ID: 8010
   Source: NT backup
   Type: Error
   Description: Microsoft Exchange services returned "Unable to perform an
   incremental backup because a required Microsoft Exchange database log file
   could not be found from a call to BackupPrepare"

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, start the Cluster Administrator program, and in the
Exchange group, right-click Microsoft Exchange System Attendant, and then click
Properties on the shortcut menu. Click the Registry Replication tab, and then
click Add to include the following registry entry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Backupinformation

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

The error message in the "Symptoms" section of this article is generated when a
full online backup has been performed on the first node of a cluster server and
a failover is performed to the second node. If you attempt an incremental backup
on the second node, the error message is generated.
