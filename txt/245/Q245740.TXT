TITLE   :XIMS: Addresses Rerouted to IPv4 Literals Result in NDRs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you configure the Routing tab in the properties for the Internet Mail Service
so that messages addressed to a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) are rerouted
to an Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) literal, and then messages are sent
through the connector, the Internet Mail Service may randomly generate
non-delivery reports (NDRs). This issue is most likely to occur when numerous
e-mail clients generate heavy message traffic.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the Internet Mail Service modifies an entry in the
routing table.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

Pack 4.
