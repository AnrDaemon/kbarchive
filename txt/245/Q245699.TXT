SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade a computer running Windows NT Server and Routing and Remote
Access Service (RRAS) to Windows NT Service Pack 6 (SP6), the RRAS configuration
can no longer be saved. When you attempt to save an RRAS configuration by
selecting Save Configuration from the Server menu drop down list, you receive
the following error message:

   An error occurred while backing up the configuration. The filename, directory
   name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. If you are saving the
   configuration of a remote computer, then the directory and drive in which you
   are saving the configuration must exist on both the local and remote
   computers.
