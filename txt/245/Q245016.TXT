TITLE   :XCLN: Outlook 2000 Attachments Keep Created/Modified Date
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you save an attachment in Outlook 2000 in Corporate or Workgroup (CW) mode,
the file's original creation date and modified date are retained. In previous
versions of Outlook, these two properties are reset to the current system date.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Users may track versions of various files based upon the Creation date or
Modified date properties. This feature of Outlook 2000 preserves these
properties of the attachment when you save the file to the file system.

The Accessed Date property reflects the system date and time that the file was
saved to the drive. To see the Created date, Accessed date, and Modified date of
a file in Windows Explorer, right click on the saved file, click Properties and
look on the General tab. Additionally, Explorer in Details view will show some
or all of these file properties.


If you are using Outlook 2000 as an Internet Mail client rather than an Exchange
Server client, the Created and Modified date and time are not preserved. When
you save the file to the file system, the Created and Modified times are
inconsistent. This is true for Outlook 2000 configured as an Internet Mail
client, either in Internet Mail Only (IMO) mode or in Corporate or Workgroup
(CW) mode. For additional information, click the article numbers below to view
