If you apply or upgrade to Systems Management Server version 2.0 Service Pack 1
on a client computer, you may install Microsoft Visual C++ 6 (6.00.8168.0)
version of the run-time libraries. This can lead to heap compatibility problems
in third-party programs installed on the client using the run-time libraries as
outlined in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
