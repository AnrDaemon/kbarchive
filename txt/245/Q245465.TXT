SUMMARY
=======

The Internet Mail Service in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 with Service Pack 2

configure within the Exchange Server Administrator program. Use the Message
Filtering feature to add domains or users who are not allowed to deliver SMTP
messages to your site.

To configure Message Filtering to restrict delivery of SMTP messages to your
site:

1. Open the Internet Mail Service properties, and click the Connections tab.

2. Click Message Filtering.

3. Click Add.

4. To prevent a specific user from delivering messages to your site, type the
   user's alias and domain name in the following format:

   "<username>@<domainname>.com" (without the quotation marks)

5. To prevent all users in a specific domain from delivering messages to your
   site, type the domain name in the following format:

   "@<domainname>.com" (without the quotation marks)

6. If you want the Internet Mail Service to automatically delete junk e-mail
   messages, click to select the "Delete messages instead of moving to turf
   directory" check box.

7. If you want the messages to be saved in a "turf" folder, click to clear the
   "Delete messages instead of moving to turf directory" check box, and manually
