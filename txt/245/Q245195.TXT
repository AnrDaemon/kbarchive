SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server 3.51, Event Viewer
may record event ID 12288, which indicates the Security Accounts Manager (SAM)
is the source of the event. If the computer is a domain controller, it may stop
authenticating user logon requests, and you may receive the following error
message:

   Out of virtual memory.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the paging file is too small or if it is severely
fragmented.

1. Set the initial size and maximum size of the paging file to zero:

   a. In Control Panel, double-click System.

   b. Click Virtual Memory.

   c. In the Initial Size (MB) and Maximum Size (MB) boxes, type "0" (without
      the quotation marks).

   d. Click Set, and then click OK.

   e. Click OK when you receive a message about increasing the registry size
      limit.

   f. Click OK.

   g. When you are prompted, click Restart Now to restart the computer.

   h. Click OK when you receive a Limited Virtual Memory message.

2. Reset the initial size and maximum size of the paging file to the same size:
