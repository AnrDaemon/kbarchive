TITLE   :DHCP and WINS Do Not Start with Command AntiVirus Version 4.54.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Command AntiVirus version 4.54 by Command Software Systems, Inc. on
a server running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, the Windows Internet Naming
Service (WINS) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) services may not
start. Event Viewer may record events 1014, 1004, 1008, 1018, 4318, and 7023.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you include .mdb files in a virus scan. Because of
the length of time the scan requires, WINS and DHCP do not correctly initialize
in Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, Command Software Systems recommends that you
remove .mdb files from the Command AntiVirus 'Files to Include' list, and then
restart the server. For information about how to modify the Command AntiVirus
'Files to Include' list, please consult the program's documentation or
manufacturer.

NOTE: Microsoft has not tested this workaround recommended by Command Software
Systems, Inc. and therefore does not guarantee its results.
