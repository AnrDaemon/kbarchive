PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Containers from multiple sites are displayed in the Policies tab of the Mailbox
Manager program if the sites have names with identical first characters. For
example, if you have sites that are named Redmond and Redmond1 and you install
the Mailbox Manager program in the Redmond site, containers from both sites are
displayed in the Policies tab.

CAUSE
=====

To display all of the containers in the Exchange Server Administrator program,
the Distinguished Names (DN) of all the containers are compared to the current
site DN name so that only the containers that belong to that site are displayed.
There is a issue in performing the comparison.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

site name.

STATUS
======

version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
