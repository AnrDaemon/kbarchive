MORE INFORMATION
================

Th IdleWinStationPoolCount value controls the number of idle sessions created by
the server during startup. Each idle session loads an additional instance of
Winlogon.exe and Csrss.exe in memory. This can consume more than 2 megabytes
(MB) of memory per session. Some users or administrators may configure this
registry value to 0 as a method of preserving resources. For additional
