SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to configure and test a PERL script with
Internet Information Server (IIS) version 4.0 and Internet Information Services
(IIS) versions 5.0 and 5.1.

The following PERL script can be used with IIS to test for the correct
installation and execution of both Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and Internet
Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) PERL script language
interpreters, such as ActiveState PERL and PERL for ISAPI.

For more information about ActiveState PERL interpreters, visit the following
ActiveState Web site:

   http://www.activestate.com/

Create a Test PERL Script
-------------------------

In Notepad, save the following lines of code in the Scripts directory as
Helloworld.pl:

   $url = "http://$ENV{SERVER_NAME}$ENV{URL}";
   $ip = "$ENV{REMOTE_ADDR}";
   print <<ENDOFTEXT;
   HTTP/1.0 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/html

   <HTML>
   <HEAD><TITLE>Hello World!</TITLE></HEAD>
   <BODY>
   <H4>Hello World!</H4>
   <P>You have reached <a href="$url">$url</a></P>
   <P>Your IP Address is $ip</P>
   <H5>Have a nice day!</H5>
   </BODY>
   </HTML>
   ENDOFTEXT
   exit(0);

NOTE: The PERL language permits no spaces at the beginning of a line.

NOTE: After you create the file, you must configure PERL to run securely with
IIS. Do not put Perl.exe in any of the directories that are accessible by a user
with a browser.

By using the Internet Service Manager (ISM) Microsoft Management Console (MMC)
snap-in, you can put the Perl.exe or PerlIS.dll files outside the typical Web
directory structure that a user has access to, and you can use the Script
Mapping feature of IIS to configure execution of PERL scripts.

Configure PERL Script Mapping for IIS 4.0
-----------------------------------------

1. Click Start, click Programs, click Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, click
   Microsoft Internet Information Server, and then click Internet Service
   Manager.

2. Right-click a Web site that you want to enable PERL for, and then click
   Properties.

3. Click the Home Directory tab.

4. Click Configuration.

5. Click Add.

6. Type the following for Executable:

   "<full path to perlis.dll>\perlis.dll" (without the quotation marks)

You can also type the following:

   "<full path to perl.exe>\perl.exe %s %s" (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: The "%s %s" is case-sensitive (for example, "%S %S" does not work).

7. For Extension, type ".pl" (without the quotation marks).

NOTE: Make sure that the All Verbs option is selected for full functionality, and
that the Script Engine check box is selected.

8. Click OK to return to the ISM.

With the default scripts directory with IIS, the URL is the following:

   http://<Server Name>/scripts/helloworld.pl

Configure PERL Script Mapping for IIS 5.0 and 5.1
-------------------------------------------------

1. Click Start, click Programs, click Administrative Tools, and then click
   Internet Information Services.

2. Right-click a Web site that you want to enable PERL for, and then click
   Properties.

3. Click the Home Directory tab.

4. Click Configuration.

5. Click Add.

6. Type the following for Executable:

   "<full path to perlis.dll>\perlis.dll" (without the quotation marks)

You can also type the following:

   "<full path to perl.exe>\perl.exe %s %s" (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: The "%s %s" is case-sensitive (for example, "%S %S" does not work).

7. For Extension, type ".pl" (without the quotation marks).

NOTE: Make sure that the All Verbs option is selected for full functionality, and
that the Script Engine check box is selected.

8. Click OK to return to the ISM.

With the default scripts directory with IIS, the URL is the following:

   http://<Server Name>/scripts/helloworld.pl
