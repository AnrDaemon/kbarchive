STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During site attachment, .sha files are placed in Sms\Inboxes\ddm.box as
notification for DDM that sites have been added to the hierarchy.

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method on the Systems Management
Server site server.

Method 1: Using the Hotfix Installer
------------------------------------

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q245169.exe is a
   Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on your site
   server.

2. Log on to your site server with an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, quit the Systems Management Server Administrator console.

4. Run Q245169.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the file
   in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

Method 2: Manual Installation
-----------------------------

1. On each site server, stop the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER service and then the
   SMS_EXECUTIVE service.

2. Replace the Ddm.dll file in the Sms\Bin\<Platform> folder with the file
   from this hotfix that corresponds to the platform of the site server.

3. Restart the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT MANAGER and SMS_EXECUTIVE services.
