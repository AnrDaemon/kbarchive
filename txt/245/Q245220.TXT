PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Microsoft Client Services for Netware to work with the
Novell Netware Management Agent (MA), the MA is unable to discover the Netware
server and organizations, and the following error message is generated:

   ********************************************************************
   Start of the LDAP discovery process
   DNS problem: 'servername' not reachable - Error code = 11001
   LDAP discovery process failed
   ********************************************************************
   ** Discovery of organizations failed
   ** Ensure that the server is currently in operation and check
   ** configuration parameters such as the host name and the
   ** host port number
   *********************************************************************

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because Netware Management Agents only work with the
Intranetware client.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue and permit this MA to run, install the Novell
Intranetware client.
