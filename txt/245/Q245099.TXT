SYMPTOMS
========

When you make a request to a Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), if the
IIS is setup to use Default.htm as the default document (or any other HTML
document), the resulting "content location" is returned to the client. However,
when IIS is setup to use Default.asp as the default document (or any other .asp
document), then the "content location" header is not sent to the client in the
response from the server. This behavior is by design.

CAUSE
=====

The content-location is an optional entity-header field. It is used to define
meta- information about the entity-body with information about the resource
identified by the request.

When the Default document is an HTM file IIS returns the content location header.
When the Default document is an ASP file it is processed by an ISAPI (ASP.dll)
and even though it is a Microsoft DLL it still does processing on behalf of the
Web developer. This is very similar to the concept that as a "CGI application"
all CGI applications are required to build their own headers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Adding the following ASP code inserts the content-location header into the
default ASP document:

   <% Response.AddHeader("Content-Location","http://" + Request.ServerVariables("HTTP_HOST") + ":" + Request.ServerVariables("SERVER_PORT") + Request.ServerVariables("SCRIPT_NAME"));%>
