SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run a 16-bit program on a computer running Microsoft Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 3, the program may quit immediately, or you may receive the
following error message:

   Hidden Console of WOW VDM
   The NTVDM CPU has encountered an illegal instruction.

   Choose Close to terminate the application.

When you click Close, you may receive several similar error messages.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you use an incorrect version of the Command.com file.
For example, this issue is known to occur if you use a Command.com file included
in Microsoft Windows 95, dated 7/11/95.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, replace the Command.com file in the Winnt\System32 folder
with the same file from another computer that is running Windows NT Workstation
4.0 or Windows NT Server 4.0, and then make sure that there are no Command.com
files dated 7/11/95 on the computer. You can also replace the Command.com file
on the computer with the same file on the Windows NT installation CD-ROM.

Additional query words: NT simulate emulate 95
