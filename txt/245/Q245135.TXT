TITLE   :Error Occurs While Windows NT Server 4.0 Setup Copies Files.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 on your computer, you
may receive the following error message during the text-based portion of the
setup process:

   Setup cannot set required Windows NT configuration information. This
   indicates an internal setup error. Please contact your group or system
   administrator.

NOTE: This may occur after the Setup program has copied about 98 percent of the
files to your hard disk.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because of either a hardware defect or a virus.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, run some hardware diagnostic programs:

1. Run the Chkdsk utility using the appropriate method:

    - If Windows NT Server 4.0 is the only operating system installed on the
      computer, run the Chkdsk utility from an MS-DOS startup disk.

    - If the computer also has one or more different operating systems
      installed, type the following command at a command prompt, and then press
      ENTER:

   chkdsk /f /r

   NOTE: The /f option fixes any errors that the Chkdsk utility finds; the /r
   option conducts a surface scan of the hard disk.

2. Use a third-party hardware diagnostic program to check for any malfunctions
   with the hard disk.

3. Use a virus-scanning program to scan the hard disk for possible viruses.

4. If applicable and possible, restore Windows NT Server 4.0 from a backup
   copy.

   NOTE: If this behavior persists after you run the diagnostic programs and
   allow the programs to repair what they can, you may need to replace the hard
   disk.
