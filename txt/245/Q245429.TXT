======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an AS/400 application screen contains an input field that requires certain
values, the Win5250 applet prevents the user from exiting the screen using a
function key unless a valid value is entered in the field.

This problem can be observed by attempting to exit the AS/400 change password
screen without updating the user password:

1. Logon to the AS/400.

2. Select 1 "User Tasks".

3. Select 8 "Change Password".

4. At this screen, it's not possible to choose F3 or F12 to cancel.

In this case, the 5250 applet is requiring a valid user input for a new password
and fails to send the function key.

CAUSE
=====

The 5250 applet was incorrectly processing the input field(s) prior to the
handling of function keys.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

(including SP1-SP4) and 4.0 (including SP1-SP3).
