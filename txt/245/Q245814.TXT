MORE INFORMATION
================

The Interix Software Development Kit includes the following libraries:

 - libc.a - Standard C library

 - libcurses.a - Ncurses (System V curses) library ported to Interix

 - libform.a - Forms library (part of Ncurses)

 - libl.a - Lex library

 - libmenu.a - Menu library (part of Ncurses)

 - libpanel.a - Panel library (part of Ncurses)

 - libsocket.a - Stub for compatibility; not actually required

 - libtermcap.a - Termcap library

 - psxdll.a - Interix API entry points as a DLL

Metaconfig scripts search specified files for application programming interfaces
(APIs). They do not locate many of the system calls because the Psxdll.a file is
not specified for the scripts.

For additional information about configuring scripts with Interix, see the
following Interix Web site:
