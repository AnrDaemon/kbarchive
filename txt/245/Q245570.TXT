TITLE   :SMSINST: Repackaged REG_MULTI_SZ Values May Be Truncated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you perform a repackage process with Systems Management Server Installer,
REG_MULTI_SZ registry values may be truncated or corrupted when you run the
script on another computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Systems Management Server Installer does not
intercept REG_MULTI_SZ registry values that contain the percent character (%)
properly. Systems Management Server Installer treats a string that is inside
single percent characters as a variable rather than a static text string. To
instruct Systems Management Server Installer to use a static text string, use
double percent characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem manually, edit the resulting script and look for
"Edit Registry" script items. If found, look for registry values of the type
"Multiple strings" and make sure that the value data uses double percent
characters where you want to use a percent character as a static character.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 2.0.
