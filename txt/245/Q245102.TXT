======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: These procedures only apply if you have installed Outlook with the
Internet Mail Only (IMO) option. To determine your installation type, on
the Help menu, click About Microsoft Outlook. In the About Microsoft Outlook dialog box you
should see "Internet Mail Only" if you have the Internet Mail Only option
installed.

SUMMARY
=======

If you use dial-up networking (DUN), you can filter large messages to prevent
them from downloading by clicking Options on the Tools menu, clicking Mail
Delivery, and then under Dial-up, in the "Don't download messages larger than"
box, typing the size in kilobytes (KB) that you want to limit downloaded files
to.

However, this option is for Post Office Protocol (POP) servers only, and does not
prevent messages from Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) servers from
downloading.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design.


Additional query words: OL20, OL98
