   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Install a parallel installation of Windows NT Server 4.0.

2. Restart the computer to the original installation.

3. Copy the Vga.dll file from the parallel installation to the original
   installation.

4. Configure the original installation to start in VGA mode:

   a. Use Registry Editor (Regedt32) to load the system hive of the original
      installation:

      1. Click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

      2. On the Registry menu, click Load Hive.

      3. Click the \Winnt\System32\Config\System folder, and then click Open.

      4. In the Key Name box, type "Test" (without the quotation marks), and
         then click OK.

   b. Edit the original system hive:

      1. Use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key

         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\ControlSetXXX\Services\VgaSave

         where XXX represents the control set number that your computer should
         start from the next time you restart it.

         NOTE: The value data of the CURRENT:REG_DWORD:0xY value of the
         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\SELECT registry key determines which control
         set you need to locate.

      2. Make sure the value data for the ImagePath value reads:

   \Winnt\System32\Drivers\Vga.sys

      3. Locate the following registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\ControlSetXXX\Services\VgaSave\Device0

      4. Double-click the InstalledDisplayDrivers value, change the value data
         to VGA, and then click OK.

   c. Unload the system hive of the original installation to save the changes:

      1. Collapse the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST key. Make sure it is highlighted.

      2. On the Registry menu, click Unload Hive, and then click Yes to confirm
         the command.

5. Restart the computer in VGA mode to the original installation.

6. Reinstall the driver for your video adapter.
