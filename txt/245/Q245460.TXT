======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Pressing the ENTER key on the numeric keypad while using the 5250 applet
generates a SPACE character instead of the desired ENTER.

CAUSE
=====

The default keyboard mapping does not map the numeric ENTER key to the ENTER
key; instead, it maps it to the SPACE key.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create a custom keyboard map by editing the
5250.kbd file supplied with SNA Server. Add the following line to the file and
save it as Keyboard.map in the same directory where the Win5250.exe program
resides.

   NumEnter: ENTER

   Q159453 SNA Server 3.0 5250 Applet Numeric Pad Function Keys Don't Work

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Clients may have multiple preferences for the functions numeric keypad keys
perform. For example, they may want to map the numeric 9 key to function as a
PageUp key or the numeric 3 key to function as a PageDn key. This and other
limited functionality can be obtained by following the steps outlined in
Q159453. However, the numeric keypad ENTER key generally has only one desired
function, and the default keyboard map has been changed to reflect this.
