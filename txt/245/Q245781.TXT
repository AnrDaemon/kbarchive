======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A form or a formset contains a DEFINE WINDOW command in the Load event. However,
the window does not appear when the form runs. The window is in Visual FoxPro's
memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Move the DEFINE WINDOW command from the Load event to the Init event or the
Activate event of the form or formset. The behavior of the DEFINE WINDOW command
varies depending on which event you choose. The "More Information" section
discusses the differences.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can occur when transporting FoxPro 2.x screens into Visual FoxPro
using the Transport utility. A functional conversion can place a DEFINE WINDOW
in the Load event under some circumstances. The following steps also apply if
you are using a formset:

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form.

2. Add a command button that has a Caption of "Exit" and that contains the
   following in the Click event:

   CLEAR WINDOW test
   ThisForm.Release

3. Place the following code in the Load event of the form:

   DEFINE WINDOW Test ;
      AT  0.000, 0.000 ;
      SIZE 28, 80  ;
      TITLE "This is a test window." ;
      FONT "MS Sans Serif", 8 ;
      FLOAT ;
      MINIMIZE ;
      SYSTEM
   MOVE WINDOW Test CENTER 
      ACTIVATE WINDOW Test
   @ 1,1 SAY "This is text in the test window." ;
      SIZE 1,80 ;
      PICTURE "@I" ;
      FONT "MS Sans Serif", 8 ;
      STYLE "T"    

4. Save and run the form. Note that only the form appears. Press the EXIT
   button.

5. Copy the code from the Load event and then comment it out.

6. Place the code in the Init event and run the form. Note that the window
   created with the DEFINE WINDOW appears behind the form. Press the EXIT
   button.

7. Copy the code from the Init event and then comment it out.

8. Place the code in the Activate event and run the form. Note that the window
   created with the DEFINE WINDOW appears in front the form.
