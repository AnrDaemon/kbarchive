======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server Move Server Wizard may not work properly and the following
error message may be displayed:

   The object cannot be found in the directory. This may be because replication
   has not completed. Microsoft Exchange directory ID no. c1010aae.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Export the directory to a .csv file.

2. Add a value for a custom attribute object to the .csv file, such as custom
   attribute1.

3. Import the .csv file back to the directory.

NOTE: When you import the .csv file, an error message similar to the following is
displayed:

   Unable to create Mailbox TestMailbox because the required Home-Server
   attribute was not specified.

4. Find the object that the .csv file import stopped responding on and either
   modify the object by adding the required attribute, or delete the object
   (this also deletes the contents of the mailbox).

This procedure allows the Move Server Wizard operation to continue.

Additional query words: msw c1010aae
