TITLE   :Cannot Use Telnet on UNIX Workstation Through Proxy Server 2.0.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may not be able to use a telnet client program on a UNIX workstation to
connect to another computer through a machine that is running Microsoft Windows
NT Server 4.0 and Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the telnet client program on the UNIX workstation is
not fully compatible with Socks version 4.3a.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use a telnet client program that is fully compatible with
Socks version 4.3a on the UNIX workstation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Socks is a cross-platform mechanism that establishes secure communications
between client and server computers. The Socks Proxy Service supports Socks
version 4.3a and allows network users transparent access to the Internet by
means of a Proxy Server. The Socks Proxy Service extends the redirection
provided by the WinSock Proxy service to non-Windows platforms. It uses
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and can be used for
TELNET, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Gopher, and Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP). The Socks Proxy Service does not support applications that rely on the
User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
