SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to print all folder and file permissions from one
folder using the Xcacls.exe utility that is included in Microsoft Windows NT
Resource Kit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the Xcacls.exe utility to print the permissions for files and
folders contained in a folder, but you cannot print the permissions for folders
and files contained in the subfolders.

To use the Xcacls.exe utility, follow these steps:

1. From the folder in which you installed the Windows NT Resource Kit, copy the
   Xcacls.exe file to the root folder in which you would like to print
   permissions

2. At the command prompt, type the following line, and then press ENTER

   XCACLS *.* > C:\<filename>.txt

where <filename> is the file name that you want to use for the folder and
file permissions.
NOTE: The default installation location for the Windows NT Resource Kit is
C:\NTreskit. On the Windows NT Resource Kit CD-ROM, the Xcacls.exe file is
located in D:\platform\Netadmin, where D is the letter of your CD-ROM drive and
platform is your computer platform, such as i386 or Alpha.
