TITLE   :PRB: SWP_NOREDRAW Not Defined for PPC 2.11 or HPC Pro 2.11
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVC600bug kbOSWinCEsearch kbWndw kbGrpDSMFCATL

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to use SetWindowPos() with the flag SWP_NOREDRAW on Palm PC (PPC)
2.11 or Handheld PC (HPC) Pro 2.11 the compiler indicates that the SWP_NOREDRAW
flag is undefined. The same code compiles on PPC 2.01 and HPC 2.00.

CAUSE
=====

In the Winuser.h file, the SetWindowPos() function has a #define SWP_NOREDRAW
flag that exists on PPC 2.01 and HPC 2.00 but is not in PPC 2.11 or HPC Pro
2.11. This flag is removed from Winuser.h since it is not supported on Windows
CE computers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid the compiler error caused by the undefined SWP_NOREDRAW flag, add the
following lines of code to your StdAfx.h file:

   #ifndef SWP_NOREDRAW
   #define SWP_NOREDRAW 0x0008
   #endif

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Use AppWizard to create a Windows CE Application.

2. Add the following line:

   int Flags = SWP_NOREDRAW;

3. Compile the program for H/PC Pro Ver. 2.11
