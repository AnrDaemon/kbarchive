SUMMARY
=======

When you transfer a file from a host running an AFTP server, and the data is in
binary format, the file may be in an unreadable format when it appears on the
AFTP client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Host data is always in EBCDIC format. When you transfer binary data using the
AFTP client, or another transfer method that emulators use (such as IND$FILE),
the data is not converted from EBCDIC to ASCII. When the file is received on the
client, it is still in EBCDIC format, which is not readable on PCs. To receive
the file in a useable format on the client, the file should be transferred in
ASCII. From the AFTP prompt, "TYPE ASCII" should be added to the "GET" command.

NOTE: The AFTP server (host) and the AFTP client should use the same code page.

REFERENCES
==========

Refer to the SNA Server Reference Manual or SNA Server online Help, or type
"help" from an AFTP prompt for the AFTP command syntax.
