TITLE   :Exchange MA May Not Run When Zoomit Starts with Local System
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Zoomit Server service is set to log on as Local System, Exchange (MAPI)
Management Agent in Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) may not run. In
addition, the following error message may be displayed:

   ******* "Discovery of Organizations, Sites, and Containers Failed"
   ******* and " Ensure that your ZOOMIT VIA service has the permissions to
   ******* read these entries".

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the credentials are passed from the Zoomit Server
service to log on to the Exchange Server computer and pull the information. If
the Zoomit Server service account does not have the proper credentials on the
Exchange Server computer, the process is unsuccessful.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, configure the Zoomit Server service to log on with an
account that has sufficient permissions to the Exchange Server directory. To
change the account, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Services.

2. Locate the Zoomit Server service, and then click Startup.

3. In the Log On As section, click This Account. Use the button to the right of
   the This Account box to select the domain account with the appropriate
   permissions.

4. Type and confirm a password for the account, and then click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message is displayed on the screen and is logged in the log files. The
log files are located in the Zoomserv\Data\Ds\00000001 folder.

NOTE: 00000001 is a number generated for the Management Agent (MA). This number
may be different, depending on when the MA was installed.

There is a folder for every MA that is created. To find out the location of your
MA log files:

1. Start Compass, click Bookmarks, and then double-click the Exchange Server MA
   you created.

2. On the Intermediate Files and Logs tab, click Log Locations.

The log file and location is displayed.
