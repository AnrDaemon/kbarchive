SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to export the contents of a Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) database to a text file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To export the contents of a DHCP database to a text file, you can use the
Dhcpcmd.exe utility that is included with Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0
Resource Kit Supplement 3.

To use this utility, using an account that has administrative privileges on the
DHCP server, type the following command at a command prompt, and then press
ENTER:

   dhcpcmd IPAddress enumclients ScopeNetAddress -option > textfile.txt

where:

 - IPAddress is the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the DHCP server.
 - ScopeNetAddress is the network address of the DHCP scope.
 - option is either v or h. The v option lists detailed lease information; the h
   option lists lease information with hardware information.
 - textfile.txt is the name of the destination text file.

For example, to export the contents to a text file named 'export.txt', type:

   dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 enumclients 11.101.0.0 -h >export.txt

You can then import the text file in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, or
Microsoft Access for ease of use.
