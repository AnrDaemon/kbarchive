TITLE   :XCON: Msg Delivery Fails Using Internet Mail Service w/NTLM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you receive e-mail over an Internet Mail Service that is configured to use
NTLM Authentication and Encryption, mail service stops working intermittently,
and the following event may be logged in the application Event Log.

   Event ID: 4131
   Source: MSExchangeIMC
   Type: Information
   Category: Internal Processing

   Description:
   An unexpected error occurred in the Internet Mail Service. Information about
   this error is stored in the data portion of this event.

   Data: * Bytes O Words
   0000: f3 03 15 00 0f 03 09 80

NOTE: The last four bytes correspond to a DWORD value of 0x8009030f
(SEC_E_MESSAGE_ALTERED).

CAUSE
=====

Data is being received in blocks from the remote server and each block is being
decrypted as it is received. In rare cases, two blocks may be received by the
server and read in a single input/output (I/O) operation. In these cases, the
second block is not processed. When the next block arrives, the Windows NT
security components recognize an issue (absent data) in the encryption stream
and return an error of SEC_E_MESSAGE_ALTERED.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
