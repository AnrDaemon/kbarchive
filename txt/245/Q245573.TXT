SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft SNA Server computer is configured to use a Channel adapter and
the APPC management verb DISPLAY is programmatically issued with any of the
following member attributes enabled, unexpected results may occur when the verb
completes:

   Lu_0_3_info
   Link_info
   Gw_info
   Link_def_info

For example, if you follow the steps outlined in the following Knowledge Base
articles to build an application to monitor or retrieve status information, the
application may fail to produce the expected results if the SNA Server computer
is configured to use a Channel adapter.

DLC types currently supported are IBMTRNET, SDLC, DFT and X25DLC; any other DLC
types cause an exception to occur.
