SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) service in Outlook to query the Global Address List on the Exchange
Server computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the LDAP service in Outlook to query the Global Address List either
anonymously or as an authenticated user. By default, Exchange Server allows
anonymous access through LDAP protocol. If you want to connect anonymously,
confirm that the User name and Password boxes are blank in the LDAP service
properties.

Alternatively, you can log on by using your Windows NT credentials for
authentication. You cannot log on by using the standard user name, domain name,
and password syntax; you must enter the logon credentials in the following
format:

 - User Name: CN=<username>,CN=<WindowsNTdomainname>

 - Password: <password>

If you enter the credentials incorrectly, you receive the following message:

   The specified Directory Service has denied access. Check the Properties for
   this Directory Service and verify that your Authentication Type settings and
   parameters are correct.
