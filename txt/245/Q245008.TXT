-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Ipconfig command on a multihomed Microsoft Windows NT Server
4.0-based computer and the computer is running Checkpoint Firewall, you may
receive the following error message:

   Fatal error: Inconsistent Registry contents

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you use Checkpoint Firewall and you delete the
registry key for a network interface card or make substantial changes to the
network.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. At the Windows NT Server 4.0-based computer, remove Checkpoint Firewall.

2. Copy the Tcpip.sys or Tcpip.sy_ file from the latest Windows NT 4.0 Service
   Pack to the \%SystemRoot%\System32 folder.

3. If it is necessary to expand the copied file, type the following command at a
   command prompt, and then press ENTER

   expand sourcepath destinationpath

   where sourcepath is the drive and folder where the file is located and the
   name of the file, and destinationpath is the drive and folder where you want
   to copy the file.

   For example, type the following command to expand the Tcpip.sy_ file to the
   C:\Winnt\System32 folder:

   expand c:\winnt\system32\tcpip.sy_ c:\winnt\system32

4. Restart the computer.

5. Reinstall Checkpoint Firewall.
