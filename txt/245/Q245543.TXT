SUMMARY
=======

The ODBC Connection Pooling counters in Performance Monitor keep track of all
the connections that are from the Connection Pool of the ODBC Driver manager.
ODBC Connection Pooling does not keep track of the connections that are NOT
pooled. Also, ODBC Connection Pooling does not keep track of any session that
you open from an OLEDB consumer.

There are six counters for this ODBC Connection Pooling object in the Performance
Monitor. To see a detailed description of these counters please refer to the
Pooling Resource
(http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/techart/pooling2.htm#pooling2_topic2/)
article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) is an OLEDB consumer. You can enable
Session Pooling from a standalone ADO program by keeping a global connection
open all the time. If you enable Session Pooling in ADO you cannot see any
activity in the ODBC Connection Pooling counters in the Performance Monitor.

Instead of enabling Session Pooling in ADO, you can enable Connection Pooling if
and ONLY if you are using the Microsoft OLEDB Provider for ODBC Driver. To
enable Connection Pooling in ADO, using that particular provider, you must call
the SQLSetEnvAttr function with the proper parameters.

After enabling Connection Pooling you can see all the activities with ODBC
Connection Pooling counter in the Performance Monitor.
