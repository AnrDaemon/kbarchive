The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On Windows 2000, version 1.0 of the RichEdit control (Riched32.dll) causes a
WM_CONTEXTMENU message to be generated when the user right-clicks in the
control. The same version of the RichEdit control on Microsoft Windows 95,
Microsoft Windows 98, and Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 does not cause the
WM_CONTEXTMENU message to be generated.

CAUSE
=====

The earlier version of the control does not pass the WM_RBUTTONUP and
WM_RBUTTONDOWN messages to the DefWindowProc function. On Windows 2000, the
RichEdit control forwards the WM_RBUTTONUP and WM_RBUTTONDOWN messages to
DefWindowProc. DefWindowProc creates the WM_CONTEXTMENU message.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no way to prevent the WM_CONTEXTMENU message from being generated. You
must make sure that your application can handle the WM_CONTEXTMENU message
without problems if this message is not expected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
