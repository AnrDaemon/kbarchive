The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3

SYMPTOMS
========

This article explains possible causes of session limit errors in the application
event log. When the session limit is exceeded, users cannot start any additional
LU6.2 sessions. The following error messages may be recorded when the session
limit has been exceeded:

 - Event 26: APPC session activation failure: session limit error

 - Event 18: APPC session activation failure: BIND negative response or UNBIND
   request received
   Sense data = 0805 0000

WORKAROUND
==========

These error messages occur most frequently when the SNA Server connection is to
an AS/400. In addition to the error messages in the event log, users cannot
start new 5250 sessions and may report a blank screen. If you are trying to
establish a session to the AS/400, check the following:

 - Use the SNA Server Manager APPC Session Viewer utility to check the session
   limit and number of sessions in use for the local LU-remote LU-mode triplet.
   It may be necessary to increase the session limits in the mode definition.
   Note: The maximum session limit for a mode on the AS/400 is 512. If you
   require more than 512 sessions to an AS/400, create another local LU and
   enable the Member of Default outgoing Local APPC LU Pool check box.

 - 5250 sessions require a unique device name for each session. Verify that the
   user is not attempting to use a device name that is already in use.

 - Verify that the mode QPCSUPP has not been deleted from SNA Server or the
   AS/400. This mode should exist on both the SNA Server and the AS/400.

 - If there is a 5494 controller between the SNA Server and the AS/400, the 5494
   may be limiting the number of sessions available. By default, the 5494
   controller is limited to 32 sessions; however, a patch is available from IBM
   to increase this limit to 128.
