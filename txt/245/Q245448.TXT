======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to a Novell server with NetWare Directory Services
(NDS) by using a WNet call, you may receive error 1317 ("The specified user does
not exist"). This error is also returned if you make a connection attempt from
an Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) dynamic-link
library (DLL) on a Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) server by using
the WNet call.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you are trying to connect to a volume on a Novell 4.x
server that is running outside of the bindery emulation context.

RESOLUTION
==========

Always use an NDS fully qualified user name to connect to a NetWare server from
a Windows NT 4.0-based server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NDS is a service that is part of the NetWare 4.x operating system. NDS regulates
access to network information, resources, and services.

Windows NT Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) cannot connect to a volume that is
contained in an NDS branch. Windows NT can only set up a gateway to a volume
that is contained in a branch by using bindery emulation.

To check for bindery emulation volumes, type "config" (without the quotation
marks) at the NetWare 4.x server's system console. This displays server
information and, on the bottom of the screen, a section titled "Bindery
Context." This section tells you which branch is running in bindery emulation.
