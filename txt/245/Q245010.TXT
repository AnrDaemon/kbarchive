TITLE   :Print Jobs Sent from LPR Print Server Are Not Printed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbprint kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 3
as a line printing utility (LPR) print server, print jobs that you send using
the LPR print server may all appear as zero-byte print jobs in the print queue.
When this occurs, the print jobs may not be printed. However, the print server
correctly handles print jobs you send from client computers.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you use Seagate Backup Exec version 7.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact Seagate to inquire about the availability of a
fix for this issue.

To work around this issue, disable Seagate Backup Exec version 7.0. For
information about how to disable Seagate Backup Exec version 7.0, view the
documentation included with Seagate Backup Exec version 7.0, or contact Seagate.
