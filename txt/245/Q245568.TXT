TITLE   :XFOR: Workgroup Postoffice Migration to Exchange Server May Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:; winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Mail for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to migrate users from Microsoft Mail for Windows to Exchange
Server 5.5, the process may stop responding (hang).

NOTE: There is no specific time that it takes for this behavior to occur (for
example, it can take five minutes or four hours for the process to hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of a damaged Microsoft Mail mailbox.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, stop the migration process and continue the
migration on the next mailbox. If the migration is unsuccessful on the next
mailbox, keep trying to migrate subsequent mailboxes until the process is
successful.

To migrate a damaged mailbox:

1. Use Microsoft Outlook to connect to the Workgroups postoffice (WGPO).

2. Log on as the user with the damaged mailbox.

3. Export the e-mail messages to a .pst file.

4. Create the user in Exchange Server, and then point Outlook to the Exchange
   Server computer.

5. Use Outlook to import the original .pst file.
