   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To restrict remote access to Event Viewer to only the Administrators group:

1. At the computer on which you want to restrict remote access to Event Viewer,
   use Registry Editor (Regedt32) to locate the following registry key:

<B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurePipeServers\Winreg\AllowedPaths</B>

2. Double-click the Machine value in the right pane. Delete the following
   string:

   System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Eventlog

   NOTE: Be careful to leave the remaining strings in place.

3. Quit Registry Editor.

4. Restart the computer.

To permit users other than members of the Administrators group to have remote
access to Event Viewer:

1. Create a global group in the domain, and then add the appropriate user
   accounts to this group.

2. Use Registry Editor (Regedt32) to locate the Winreg registry key.

3. Click the Winreg key, and then click Permissions on the Security menu.

4. In the Registry Key Permissions dialog box, click Add.

5. In the Add Users And Groups dialog box, click the name of the global group,
   and then click Add.

6. In the Type Of Access box, click the appropriate type, and then click OK.

7. To close the Registry Key Permissions dialog box, click OK.
