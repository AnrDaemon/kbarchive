PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a message with an attachment or you attempt to open an
attachment, you may receive an error message similar to:

   You do not have appropriate permissions to open.

   Object not found.

You can open messages without attachments with no problem.

CAUSE
=====

Permissions are improperly set on the %SystemRoot%\Temp folder on the server
running Terminal Server. Each user needs Read permission on the
%SystemRoot%\Temp folder and Full Control permission on his or her individual
Temp folder. The permissions for the individual Temp folders are created by the
operating system; the folders are located in a subfolder in the
%SystemRoot%\Temp folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, make sure that the permissions on the %SystemRoot%\Temp
folder are set to Read for the Everyone group and that the operating system is
correctly setting Full Control permission for each individual Temp folder.
