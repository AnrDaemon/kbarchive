TITLE   :XCON: Notes Delegate Cannot See Meetings from Outlook User
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft Outlook user sends a meeting request to a Lotus Notes user. The
Notes user accepts the meeting. A delegate then opens that user's Calendar, and
is unable to see that the meeting is scheduled.

Similarly, a Notes invitation with sensitivity set to Mark Private, arrives in
the Outlook mailbox with sensitivity set to Normal. The expected result is that
the sensitivity should be set by the Exchange Notes Connector as Private when
the invitation is delivered to the Outlook user's Inbox.

CAUSE
=====

When the Outlook user sends a meeting with sensitivity set to Private, the
document is created with the OrgConfidential attribute set to 0. The Exchange
Notes Connector should honor the organizer's intent by specifying
OrgConfidential=1 when the sensitivity is set to Private, but does not.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
