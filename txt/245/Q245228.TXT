TITLE   :SMS: Liccli95.exe May Hang Windows 95/98 Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Software Metering server is busy handling other requests and a client
that is running Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98 tries to connect to
the server, the client may receive a "pipe busy" error message in the Liccli.log
file. The client retries 15 times; the client computer may not be useable during
this time.

CAUSE
=====

Liccli95.exe may use all the computer resources so that users cannot perform any
work. This behavior does not occur with Microsoft Windows NT-based computers
because the "Pipe busy" condition is handled differently.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
