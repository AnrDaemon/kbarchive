TITLE   :Logon Script Does Not Run Remotely Using RAS Dial-up Connection
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
Also applies to Windows 2000 Professional clients.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a domain through a Remote Access Service (RAS) dial-up
connection from a Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0-based computer, logon
scripts that are set to run may not run. However, when you use the same user
account to log on to the domain through a RAS dial-up connection from a
Microsoft Windows 95-based computer, the logon scripts run as expected.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Windows NT Workstation 4.0-based computer does
not have a computer account on the domain. In order for logon scripts to run,
you must log on to the domain, and logging on to a domain from a Windows NT
Workstation-based computer requires that the computer have a computer account on
the domain.

NOTE: In order to logon to the domain through RAS, you must use the check box on
the <CTRL> + <ALT> + <DEL> screen.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this issue by using the steps below.

NOTE: Microsoft does not recommend running logon scripts when you log on to a
domain through a RAS dial-up connection. In Windows NT 4.0, you can use a user
profile to achieve the same result.

1. Make sure that the remote Windows NT Workstation 4.0-based computer has a
   computer account on the domain.

2. If this does not resolve the issue, follow one of these steps:

   a. Use Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98 as the operating system for
      computers that are to log on to the domain through a RAS dial-up
      connection.

   -or-

   b. Create a shortcut to the script file, and then place the shortcut in the
      StartUp folder on the remote computers.

   NOTE: The script file is located on the Netlogon share. The default location
   of the Netlogon share on the primary domain controller is the
   %SystemRoot%\System32\Repl\Import\Scripts folder.
