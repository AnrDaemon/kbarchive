TITLE   :APM Executes Local Program Version If Package Share Unavailable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send an advertisement to a workstation and that workstation is unable
to reach the package distribution location to execute the program command line,
the Systems Management Server Available Programs Manager on the client attempts
to execute the program using the local system path. If the Available Programs
Manager finds the file specified in the program command line in the path, it
executes the local version.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by the way the Available Programs Manager handles
unreliable connections. Systems Management Server assumes a fast, reliable
connection between the clients and their servers. When a fast, reliable
connection is unavailable, the Available Programs Manager attempts to find the
program locally.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, follow these steps:

 - Assure a fast, reliable connection between the clients and the server.

 - If reliable connections are not possible, use unique names for the executable
   in the command line of the program.
