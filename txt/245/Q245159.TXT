TITLE   :FIX: SendData Only Works Over the Latest Connection

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

For a 32-bit Visual Basic application with multiple Winsock Control objects that
maintain TCP connections to other socket applications, SendData() only works
over the most recently established connection. This behavior is reproducible on
versions prior to and include Microsoft Visual Studio SP3.

CAUSE
=====

The event messages associated with each SendData() are flushed from the message
queue by the latest socket connection. This causes data to queue up and with no
event messages available to start the data send process for previous
connections.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest service pack for
Visual Studio 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce the problem assuming an application maintains an array of three
Winsock Control objects, each of controls has established a connection with its
peer side over TCP. Label the connections as C1, C2, and C3 based on the order
the connections are established, with C3 as the most recently established
connection. If you attempt to do the following:

      Private Sub cmdSendData_Click()
          Dim i As Long
          For i = 1 To iIndex
              If (socks(i).State = sckConnected) Then
                  socks(i).SendData txtSendData.Text
              End If
          Next i
      End Sub

Only the peer side of C3 connection get the messages. If you disconnect C3, the
peer side of C2, which becomes the most recent connection at the time, will
start to receive messages intended for it.
