-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The "Starting Flight Simulator" section on page 2 of the Pilot's Handbook for
Flight Simulator 2000, incorrectly states that you need to insert the Disc 1
CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive to start or play the game.

This is a typographical error. To start or play the game, you may need to insert
the Disc 2 CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you choose the Custom installation option when you install Flight Simulator,
you may be able to start the program with the Disc 1 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive
depending upon the installation options you select.

If you choose the Typical installation option, you must always start Flight
Simulator with the Disc 2 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive.
