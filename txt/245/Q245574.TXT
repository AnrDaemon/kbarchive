SUMMARY
=======

By default, performing a Request.ServerVariables("REMOTE_HOST") in ASP returns a
null value, which causes Internet Information Server (IIS) to return the value
of REMOTE_ADDR, the IP address of the client. This is by design to increase
performance for Web hosting. However, by changing a setting in the metabase, IIS
performs a reverse DNS lookup and returns the host name of the client
connecting.

NOTE: Enabling reverse lookups incurs extra processing overhead, that degrades
the performance of your Web server. This information is not recommended for high
capacity sites where performance is critical.

With the metabase setting enabled, every request for the REMOTE_HOST server
variable causes IIS to pass a name resolution request off to the operating
system, which attempts to execute a reverse DNS lookup. If the reverse DNS
lookup fails to return the host name, the operating system then attempts name
resolution using NetBIOS. If NetBIOS resolution fails an empty value is returned
to IIS, which returns the REMOTE_ADDR value (client's IP address) to the
original REMOTE_HOST request.

Reverse lookups can be set for the entire Web server or for individual Web sites,
requiring administrative access to the metabase through the IIS Admin Objects.
This article describes two methods for modifying the metabase with the IIS Admin
Objects, using Active Server Pages and using Windows Scripting Host from the
command-line. For the following Active Server Pages examples, create an .asp
file in a Web site or virtual directory that has Script or Execute access
enabled and copy the following code into the .asp file. The command-line method
requires that the Admin Sample Scripts (installed during IIS setup) and Windows
Scripting Host be installed (WSH installs with the Windows NT Option Pack,
Windows 2000, Internet Explorer 5 and from:

   Scripting Download Page

The command-line method requires that instructions be issued from a command
prompt where the Adsutil.vbs script is located. The location of the Adsutil.vbs
script depends on the version IIS, but is in the following directories by
default:

   Internet Information Server 4.0 - C:\WinNT\System32\InetSrv\AdminSamples<BR/>
   Internet Information Server 5.0 - C:\InetPub\AdminScripts
 

Because improperly modifying the metabase can negatively impact Internet
Information Server, Microsoft strongly recommends backing up the metabase before
making any modifications.

Example 1 - Enabling Reverse Lookups for all sites::

This ASP code example enables all Web sites to perform a reverse lookup when a
Request.ServerVariables("REMOTE_HOST") is issued. Due to the hierarchical design
of the metabase, Web sites that do not explicitly have the EnableReverseDNS
entry set inherit the value from the earlier node. ASP Method:

   <%
   Dim oIIS
   Dim vEnableRevDNS
   Dim vDisableRevDNS

   vEnableRevDNS = 1
   vDisableRevDNS = 0

   Set oIIS = GetObject("IIS://localhost/w3svc")
   oIIS.Put "EnableReverseDNS", vEnableRevDNS
   oIIS.SetInfo
   Set oIIS = Nothing

   %>

Command-line Method:

   cscript adsutil.vbs set /w3svc/EnableReverseDNS "TRUE"

Example 2 - Enabling Reverse Lookups for individual sites::

This example enables a reverse lookup for a specific Web site when a
Request.ServerVariables("REMOTE_HOST") is issued. Web sites are referenced in
the metabase by an integer value. Because the Default Web Site is the first site
created, it receives the reference number 1. This example enables reverse
lookups for only the Default Web Site, to allow reverse lookups on other Web
sites replace 1 in the following line:

   Set oIIS = GetObject("IIS://localhost/w3svc/1/ROOT")

with the numeric value of the Web site that needs to perform reverse lookups. The
easiest way to determine the numeric value of a specific Web site is to look at
the number listed at the end of the folder name where the log file name is
specified. This can be accessed through the MMC/Internet Service Manager by
selecting the Web site and choosing Action, Properties, Active Log Format and
then Properties. The Default Web site's Log file name is W3SVC1\exyymmdd.log,
corresponding to the /1/ROOT value. ASP Method:

   <%
   Dim oIIS
   Dim vEnableRevDNS
   Dim vDisableRevDNS

   vEnableRevDNS = 1
   vDisableRevDNS = 0

   Set oIIS = GetObject("IIS://localhost/w3svc/1/ROOT")
   oIIS.Put "EnableReverseDNS", vEnableRevDNS
   oIIS.SetInfo
   Set oIIS = Nothing

   %>

Command-line Method:

   cscript adsutil.vbs set /w3svc/1/ROOT/EnableReverseDNS "TRUE"
