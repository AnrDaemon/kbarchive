======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 in a multi-domain environment,
the SMS Service account may be locked out and/or generate failed login attempts
in the domain where SMS is installed and any other domains that are
trust-related.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because when Client Configuration Manager (CCM) is
installing an SMS 2.0 client on a Microsoft Windows NT-based computer, by
default it uses the SMS Service account unless an SMS Client Remote Installation
account has been specified. CCM needs administrative rights when it connects to
a workstation to install the SMS client. If CCM is unable to connect, it appends
different prefixes to the SMS Service account in an attempt to connect to the
client. For example, it might try Domain\SMSService first, and if that does not
work, it may append other domain names that are present in your environment to
the SMS Service account. If a duplicate SMS Service account in the other domains
with the same password does not exist, login attempts do not work when CCM
attempts to use the other domain prefixes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use an SMS Client Remote Installation account that
has access to all workstations in all domains. If CCM is successful in using
this account, it does not use the SMS Service account.

NOTE: SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 permits you to specify multiple SMS Client Remote
Installation Accounts for the same domain or different domains. Not only can SMS
use multiple client installation accounts, it does not switch domain contexts of
any account. SMS only uses the accounts that are specified in the properties,
and the SMS service account. The SMS service account only uses the domain
context that is specified during setup, and does not switch between available
domains. This prevents the account from locking out.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
