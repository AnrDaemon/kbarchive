======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a Microsoft Windows NT user group and you give it the rights to
advertise software distributions to collections, the user group may not have
appropriate rights even if the new collection is created by a member of the
group.

CAUSE
=====

When a member of a Windows NT user group creates a new collection, they are
granted Read, Modify and Delete rights, by default. The members of the Windows
NT user group are not able to advertise to this newly created collection unless
a Systems Management Server (SMS) administrator who has appropriate rights gives
the user group Advertise rights on the new collection.

Each time a new collection is created, the Windows NT user group must be granted
Advertise, Read Resource and Modify Resource rights before they can advertise to
this collection.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, give the Windows NT user group Advertise, Read,
Read Resource and Modify Resource rights at the Collection Class object level.
When the user group has these rights, the group can advertise to any resource in
any collection.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
