TITLE   :FIX: Wrong Large Currency Values Returned From Late Bound Object
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbActiveX kbCtrl kbDLL kbLocalSvr kbVBp kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport kbVS600sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the data type of a class property in an ActiveX DLL is Currency, and you
use late binding in a client to set a large value to the property, incorrect
results are returned from the property. If you use a method to retrieve the
large Currency value, the same behavior results.

STATUS
======

listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX DLL project. Rename it to "CurrDLL" (without the
   quotation marks). Class1 is created by default.

2. Paste the following code in Class1's code module:

   Dim mCurr As Currency

   Public Property Let Curr(x As Currency)
       mCurr = x
       MsgBox "Let = " & x
   End Property

   Public Property Get Curr() As Currency
       MsgBox "pre-get = " & mCurr
       Curr = mCurr
   End Property

3. From the File menu, select Make CurrDLL.dll to compile the project, and
   create CurrDLL.dll.

4. From the File menu, select New project, and select Standard EXE project.
   Form1 is created by default.

5. From the Project menu, select References, check CurrDLL.dll, and then click
   OK.

6. Add two TextBox controls and two CommandButton controls to Form1.

7. Paste the following code into the code module of Form1:

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       Dim MyObj As Object
       Set MyObj = CreateObject("CurrDll.Class1")
       MyObj.Curr = Val(Text1.Text)
       Text2.Text = MyObj.Curr
   End Sub

   Private Sub Command2_Click()
       Dim MyObj As CurrDll.Class1
       Set MyObj = New CurrDll.Class1
       MyObj.Curr = Val(Text1.Text)
       Text2.Text = MyObj.Curr
   End Sub
   Private

8. Press the F5 key to run the project. Enter "922000000000000" (without the
   quotation marks) into TextBox1, click the Late Binding button, and note that
   the incorrect value is displayed in TextBox2.

9. Click the Early Binding button, and note that the correct value is now
   displayed in TextBox2.
