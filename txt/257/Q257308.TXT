TITLE   :XCON: Dynamic RAS Doesn't Work w. "-RpcServerUseProtSeqEp..."
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Dynamic Remote Access Service (RAS) dials the receiving server, but the
connection may be terminated (the other server hangs up) and no mail is
transferred. When you run the Rpingc32 utility against the Rpings utility, the
ping does not work and the following error message is displayed:

   -RpcServerUseProtSeqEp returned a status 0xE

CAUSE
=====

The hexadecimal value 0xE translates to a decimal value of 14. If you type the
following command at a command prompt

   NET HELPMSG 14

the Microsoft Windows NT error code is translated as "Not enough storage is
available to complete this operation."

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, increase the amount of random access memory (RAM) on the
receiving server.
