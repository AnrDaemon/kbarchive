Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. From the Project menu, add a new MDI form, a new Form, a new Class Module,
   and a new UserControl object to the project.

3. On the Project menu, and click to select Project1 Properties. On the General
   tab, set the Startup Object to MDIForm1.

4. With MDIForm1 visible, go to the Tools menu, and click to select the Menu
   Editor. Create one new menu item with the following properties:

+------------------------+
| Caption | Load Forms   | 
+------------------------+
| Name    | mnuLoadForms | 
+------------------------+

5. Set Form1 and Form2's MDIChild Property = True.

6. On the Project menu, click to select Components. Select Microsoft Windows
   Common Controls 6.0 and click OK.

7. Add a Toolbar control to UserControl1.

8. Right-click on Toolbar1 and select Properties. Select the Buttons tab, and
   click Inset Button to add a new button to Toolbar1. Set the Caption Property
   to Exit.

9. Close the design window for the UserControl and place an instance of
   UserControl1 on Form1 and Form2.

10. Paste the following code into MDIForm1:

   Option Explicit

   Private Sub mnuLoadForms_Click()
       
       Form1.Show
       Form2.Show
       
   End Sub

11. Paste the following code into the code windows of Form1 and Form2:

   Option Explicit

   Implements Class1

   Private Sub Class1_UnloadForm()
       
       Unload Me
       
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()

       UserControl11.AddControl Me

   End Sub

12. Paste the following code into Class1:

   Option Explicit

   Public Sub UnloadForm()
   '
   End Sub

13. Paste the following code into UserControl1:

   Option Explicit

   Private ucCollection As Collection

   Public Sub AddControl(Item As Class1)
       
       ucCollection.Add Item
       
   End Sub

   Private Sub Toolbar1_ButtonClick(ByVal Button As MSComctlLib.Button)
   Dim cls As New Class1

       Set cls = ucCollection.Item(1)

       cls.UnloadForm

       Set cls = Nothing
       
   End Sub

   Private Sub UserControl_Initialize()
       
       Set ucCollection = New Collection
       
   End Sub

   Private Sub UserControl_Terminate()

       Set ucCollection = Nothing

   End Sub

14. Save and run the project. Select the Load Forms menu to load Form1 and
   Form2. Then click on the Exit button on both forms in rapid succession. You
