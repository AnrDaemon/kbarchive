TITLE   :First Character Typed After Logon Is Ignored in 16-Bit Programs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The first character you type after logging on to a Terminal Server session may
be ignored if you type it in a 16-bit program or a Windows NT Virtual DOS
Machine (NTVDM).

This problem can also occur if the NUM LOCK state is changed and the Terminal
Server Client session window is not the active window. This affects only NTVDMs
or programs running within an NTVDM.

CAUSE
=====

When you are logging on to a Terminal Server session, a simulated NUM LOCK
keystroke is generated to synchronize the keyboard state with that of the client
computer. This simulated keystroke does not have the Extended Keyboard flag set,
causing NTVDMs to lose the next keystroke.

STATUS
======

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition Service Pack 6.
