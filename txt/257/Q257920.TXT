TITLE   :"The Specified Name ..." Message When Installing MSCS Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install a Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) server, you may
receive the following error message:

   The specified name is already in use on this network. You must enter a unique
   cluster name.

Note that you may receive this error message even though you are using a unique
cluster name.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the NetBIOS interface has been removed from the MSCS
server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, add the NetBIOS Interface to your MSCS server, and then
disable the NetBIOS Interface on the "heartbeat" network adapter:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Network.

2. Click the Services tab, click Add, click NetBIOS Interface, click OK, click
   Close, and then click No when prompted to restart your computer.

3. Apply the latest service pack previously installed on your computer, and then
   restart your computer.

4. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Network.

5. Click the Bindings tab, click All Adapters in the "Show Bindings for" box,
   and then double-click the "heartbeat" network adapter.

6. Double-click WINS Client (TCP/IP), click NetBIOS Interface, click Disable,
   and then click OK.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you perform multiple rebinds on the MSCS server, the bindings may not work
properly. In this case, you may need to remove and then reinstall the Transport
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol. For additional information
