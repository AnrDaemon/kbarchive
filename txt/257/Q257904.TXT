KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Service Pack 4 (SP4) to a Windows NT 4.0-based computer that you
use to remotely administer a Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) server that is
running Service Pack 3 (SP3), you may experience intermittent issues. For
example, when you try to create a file share, you may receive the following
error message:

   The parameter is incorrect

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, replace the SP4 versions of the Cluadmin.exe and the
Cluadmex.dll files on your Windows NT 4.0-based computer with the SP3 versions
of the files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Creating other resources on the MSCS server very rarely generate error messages,
and the resources function as expected.
