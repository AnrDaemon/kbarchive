TITLE   :SMS: Remote Tools Window Displays Incorrect Port Number
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbHelpDesk kbsms200preSP3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During a remote control session of a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service
Pack 2 (SP2) client computer, the title bar may display the following text:

   Remote Control - '<computer name>':1761

This may occur even though the correct port number being used for this type of
remote control session is 2701, so the title bar should display the following
text:

   Remote Control - '<computer name>':2701

You may be able to observe the same behavior in a Remote Reboot window.

NOTE: For Remote Control sessions to pre-SP2 clients, the port number that is
used is still 1761. Ports that are used for Remote Tools were changed in SP2.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 SP2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not impair any functionality. 2701 is the correct port number
to use for a remote control session to an SP2 client. For additional information
