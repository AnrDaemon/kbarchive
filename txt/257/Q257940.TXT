TITLE   :Digital Cluster Server Loses Drive Letter Assignment
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you reboot a node on a Digital (Compaq) cluster server with an HSZ array
controller connected to a Storage Works external shared array, the shared drive
may appear to lose the drive letter assignment.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Storage Works array reports back a smaller
partition size than what was originally available on the logical disk. You can
identify this by comparing the partition size to the logical disk size.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, re-initialize the logical disk from within the
configuration utility for the HSZ array controller.
