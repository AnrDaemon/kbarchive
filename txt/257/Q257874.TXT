TITLE   :XADM: Hard Coded Organization Name When Installing DMS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you install the Defense Message System (DMS) version of Exchange Server from
the CD-ROM provided from Lockheed Martin Federal Systems, the organization name
is hard coded (it cannot be changed) as the following:

   Organization

MORE INFORMATION
================

During the installation you can enter any organization name. For example, you
can enter an organization name of "ORGANIZATON" or "organization," but the
actual organization name is still "Organization."

This is important to remember when you need to recover the directory on a
DMS-enabled server. If there is not an exact, case-sensitive match of the
organization name, you cannot restore the directory properly.
