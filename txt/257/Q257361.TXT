The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Mixed-case NetBIOS names may be present in a WINS database. For example, if a
computer that registers with WINS is named Server1, you may see entries similar
to:

   SeRvEr1---- [00h]
   SeRvEr1---- [02h]
   SeRvEr1---i [00h]
   SeRvEr1---i [02h]

In some cases, you may also see entries similar to:

   iNtEl.nBcBaGr. [02h]
   iNtEl.nBcBaGr. [00h]
   iNtEl.nBcBaGr. [01h]

CAUSE
=====

Name registrations as outlined above are made by the Intel Ping Discover Service
(PDS) software from Intel LanDesk Management Suite. For additional information
about this service, please contact Intel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is not indicative of WINS database corruption. The NetBIOS name
space is not case sensitive; registrations such as these should not cause
problems with Microsoft NetBIOS name resolution.
