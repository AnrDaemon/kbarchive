TITLE   :XFOR: Meeting Request NDR When Sent to Multiple Recipients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a meeting request from a Microsoft Outlook client and you select
multiple Lotus Notes recipients or a distribution list (DL) that contains
multiple Notes recipients, you may receive a non-delivery report (NDR). The
description of that NDR contains the following string:

   Unable to convert message to format suitable for target system

In the Microsoft Windows NT application event log or the Log Browser (visible
through the Exchange Connectivity Administrator utility), the following is
displayed:

   41300: Notes Package ID: Notes Store Facility (NSF). Extended Reason String:
   Database already contains a document with this ID (UNID)

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because the meeting request has been split into multiple
messages. These messages are then placed in the Mail.box file on the Notes
server. The first message is placed properly, but subsequent messages may not be
placed properly because the messages are all given the same document ID (because
the messages are sourced from the same meeting request). Notes only allows
unique document IDs in the Mail.box file at any point in time.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make sure that the manner in which the distribution
list is expanded is correct. Ensure that the Notes custom recipients all reside
on the same Exchange Server computer, or that the distribution list is expanded
by only one Exchange Server computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem can also occur if you send a message to a distribution list that
contains Exchange Server mailboxes with Notes custom recipients listed as
alternate recipients.
