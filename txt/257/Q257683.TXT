KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbAdvertisement kbsms200preSP3fix kbsms200SP3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an advertised program is run with the following properties, the value of
the TMP environment variable after the reboot is not the same as the value
before the reboot:

 - Run mode: Run with administrative rights (no account specified)

 - After running: SMS restarts computer

When this behavior occurs, a software distribution that uses a two-phase process
and shares data by using the TMP variable may not work. Files that are stored by
using the TMP variable are not available after the reboot because the TMP
variable is changed.

CAUSE
=====

The value of the TMP variable is not properly restored within Advertisement
Program Manager (APM).

RESOLUTION
==========

Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
