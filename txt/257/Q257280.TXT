PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a package with Systems Management Server (SMS) Installer with
the option to reboot the client and you then send the advertisement to clients
that are running Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98, the clients may
run the package every time they log on to the network until the advertisement
expires.

The client files show that a complete file is generated in the
MS\Sms\Clicomp\Apa\Data\Complete folder for the package.

CAUSE
=====

When a program reboots the computer, Advertisement Program Manager (APM) writes
the schedule data file to the Complete folder and then relies on the Unschedule
event to remove the schedule data file from the Jobs folder. On Windows
95/Windows 98 clients, APM is terminated before it can unschedule programs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
