TITLE   :PRB: Problem When You Call ITC Execute from Form_Load
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

It may be tempting to call the Execute method of Internet Transfer Control in
Form_Load with the intention to send a request automatically. However, the
StateChanged subroutine may not get called if the method is called when the form
is being loaded.

RESOLUTION
==========

To send a request automatically with the Execute method, you can call the method
in Sub Main() and set Sub Main() as the startup object:

1. Add a module to the Visual Basic project.

2. Add Sub Main() to the module.

3. Select Sub Main() as the Startup Object from the project Properties.

4. Remove Sub Form_Load from the form.

5. Call the Execute method in Sub Main() as follows:

   Sub Main()
      Load Form1
      'Form1.Show
      ...
      Form1.Inet1.Execute ...
   End Sub
