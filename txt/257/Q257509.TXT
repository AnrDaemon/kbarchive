TITLE   :Hardware Inventory May Cause Third-Party Win32 Services to Stop
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the enumeration of the Win32_Service class by the Hardware Inventory
agent (Hinv32) on Microsoft Windows NT-based clients, some third-party Win32
services may stop or log the following event:

   Event ID: 7016
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Type: Error
   Category: None
   Description: The <ServiceName> service has reported an invalid current
   state 0.

CAUSE
=====

Hinv32 makes standard Win32 calls to enumerate services. Third-party services
may stop or log event ID 7016 when Hinv32 makes a call to the Win32
ControlService function and passes it a SERVICE_CONTROL_ INTERROGATE control
code. This control code requests the service to update its current status
information immediately to Service Control Manager.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, you can disable the enumeration of the
Win32_Service class by modifying the Sms_def.mof file and setting the reporting
for the Win32_Service class to False.

WARNING: Exercise caution when you edit .mof files. Create a backup copy of the
.mof file before you edit it.

Modify the master Sms_def.mof file on each site server in turn, or modify it on
one server and then copy it to all others. The Sms_def.mof file is located in
the <Sms_root>\Inboxes\Clifiles.src\Hinv folder. You can edit the file by
using a text editor (such as Notepad). To disable Win32_Service class
enumeration, locate the following entry:

   

   [SMS_Report(TRUE),
	SMS_Group_Name("Services"),
	ResID(5000),ResDLL("SMS_RXPL.dll"),
	SMS_Class_ID("MICROSOFT|SERVICE|1.0")]
   class Win32_Service : SMS_Class_Template<BR/>

Change "TRUE" to "FALSE" in the first line to disable the entire class
enumeration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Third-party services that exhibit this behavior with Hinv32 may also stop when
you use the Sc.exe tool from the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit and pass it
the interrogate command. For example:

   sc interrogate <third-party service name>
