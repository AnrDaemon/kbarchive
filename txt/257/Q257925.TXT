TITLE   :Cluster Server Does Not Detect Network Problems in Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0; winnt:1.0

KEYWORDS:kbhw kbnetwork kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Cluster Server in Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition, does not detect
network problems. Disconnecting the network cable from the active node does not
cause an IP address or group to failover. Also, simulated network adapter
failures may not cause an IP address to stop working, or cause Cluster Server to
declare that an adapter is down.

CAUSE
=====

The Cluster service verifies that the IP address is online by checking the
network stack to make sure that it is functioning. A network problem does not
invalidate the IP addresses that are registered on that adapter. This causes the
IP address to stay online even though the route is down.

This functionality is included in Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design for Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition.
