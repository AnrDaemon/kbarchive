   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Not all client access point (CAP) subfolders are created when assigning the
Client Access Point site system role to a server.

CAUSE
=====

If the CAP site system role was previously incompletely removed from a server,
and the server later is reassigned the site system CAP role, a new
CAP_<sitecode> share must be created. More than 10 folders must be created
under the CAP_<sitecode> share. If the initial CAP removal process is
incomplete, all of the subfolders may not be created with the new CAP role
assignment.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

During the Site System CAP Role Removal, SMS creates a registry value in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Inbox Source

called
Reserved "Inbox Remove Requested".

To work around this issue, remove the registry value
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Inbox Source
"Inbox Remove Requested" in Reserved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Site Removal is performed successfully, the "Inbox Source" key is
removed. If this key is not removed, when performing a new installation, it
prevents an Inbox Manager from creating the proper CAP subfolders. If logging is
enabled, Inboxmgr.log shows the following message:

   Found 49 inboxes that need to be deinstalled.
