MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps use the Biblio database. They assume that the database is
located in the default Visual Basic installation path:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Vb98\Biblio.mdb

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. On the Project menu, select References. On the References dialog box, check
   Microsoft ADO 3.51 Object Library, and then click OK.

3. On the Project menu, add a new module, and then insert the following code:

   Option Explicit

   Public MainDatadb As Database

4. Add a Command Button to Form1.

5. Add the following code to the code window of Form1:

   Option Explicit

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       Form2.ShowMeGeneral MainDatadb, "Authors", "Author", "AU_id", , _
         "Find an author", "au_id"
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       Dim DBName As String

       ' Change the following path if necessary for your system
       DBName = "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\BIBLIO.MDB"
       Set MainDatadb = OpenDatabase(DBName, False, False)
   End Sub

6. On the Project menu, add a second form, Form2, to the project.

7. Add a ListBox control to Form2.

8. Add the following code to the code window of Form2:

   Option Explicit

   Public SelectedValue As String
   Public KeyValue As String
   Public Canceled As Boolean

   Public Sub ShowMeGeneral(DBName As Database, DBTable As String, _
    FldDisplay As String, FldReturn As String, Optional InSql As Variant, _
    Optional Title As Variant, Optional KeyField As Variant)

       Dim Sql As String, TempRS As Recordset
       Dim Indx As Integer, TmpString As String
       Dim DisplayString As String
       If IsMissing(InSql) Then
           Sql = "SELECT [" & FldDisplay & "],[" & FldReturn & "] " & _
           "FROM " & DBTable & " ORDER BY [" & FldDisplay & "];"
       Else
           Sql = InSql
       End If
       Set TempRS = DBName.OpenRecordset(Sql, , dbReadOnly)
       Do Until Indx > 5000
           DisplayString = TempRS(FldDisplay) & ""
           DisplayString = "abcdefghijklmm" & Indx
           List1.AddItem DisplayString
           Indx = Indx + 1
           TempRS.MoveNext
       Loop
       TempRS.Close
       Set TempRS = Nothing
       List1.ListIndex = 0
       Canceled = True
       Me.Show vbModal
   End Sub

   Private Sub List1_DblClick()
       Unload Me
   End Sub

9. Run the project and click on Command1 to open Form2.

10. Double-click on an item in the ListBox control on Form2.

The result should be an Invalid Page Fault.
