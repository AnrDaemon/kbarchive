Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 6.0 and create a Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Place a DataGrid control on the form, such as DataGrid1.

3. Place an ADO Data control on the form (Adodc1).

4. Set Adodc1.CommandType to 2 (adCmdTable).

5. Set Adodc1.ConnectionString to Provider=Microsoft.JET.OLEDB.4.0;Data
   Source=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\Biblio.mdb.

6. Set Adodc1.RecordSource to Authors.

7. Set DataGrid1.DataSource to Adodc1.

8. Run the program and click to select any cell, and put a double-byte string in
   that cell.

9. Move the cells around by using the ARROW key.

10. Note that the ARROW key (CURSOR key) works fine on cells that contain only
   single-byte characters, but does not work on cells that contain any
   double-byte characters.
