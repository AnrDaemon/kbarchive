-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 2000, 2000 SP1, 2000 SP2 Professional 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 2000, 2000 SP1, 2000 SP2 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 2000, 2000 SP1, 2000 SP2 Advanced Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

MS-DOS programs that use command-line arguments may work improperly and may
indicate that they are receiving a command line that is missing the first
character.

CAUSE
=====

The command-line tail length is at offset 0x80 in the MS-DOS program segment
prefix (PSP). Offset 0x81 has a blank in it. The actual content of the tail
starts at offset 0x82. Some old MS-DOS compilers, including the Microsoft
Fortran for MS-DOS version 5.1 compiler and the Microsoft Pascal compiler,
assume that offset 0x81 is the initial character of the command-line tail
instead of offset 0x82.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the routine that gets the command-line tail
so that it starts with offset 0x81 from the PSP instead of offset 0x82.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows 2000 Service Pack 3.
