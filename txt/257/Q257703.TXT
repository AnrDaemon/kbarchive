Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic 6.0. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. On the Project menu, select Components. Select the Microsoft Windows Common
   Controls 6.0 (SP3), and then click OK.

3. Add a ListView control to Form1.

4. Set the View property of the ListView control to 3 - lvwReport.

5. Add the following code to the module of Form1:

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       ListView1.ColumnHeaders.Add , , "column 1"    
   End Sub

   Private Sub ListView1_ColumnClick(ByVal ColumnHeader As MSComctlLib.ColumnHeader)
       Form2.Show vbModal
   End Sub

6. From the Project menu, add a second form to the project.

7. Add a CommandButton to Form2.

8. Add the following code to the module of Form2:

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       Unload Me
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       Me.Top = Form1.Top + Form1.Height
       Me.Left = Form1.Left + Form1.Width
   End Sub

9. Run the project.

10. Click on Column 1 in the ListView control.

11. Click on Column 1 a second time. This should not be possible. You should
   receive an error stating that the form is already loaded.
