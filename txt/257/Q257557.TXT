---------------------------------------------

The cover of this book states that the accompanying CD-ROM includes a trial
version of Liquid Motion. The CD actually includes a Setup file that will
redirect you to Shopnow.com. While the product was available, Shopnow.com would
allow you to obtain a license that would allow you to download a "trial" version
of Liquid Motion.

You will no longer be able to download or install Liquid Motion from any
location, as Microsoft has discontinued Liquid Motion entirely. For further
information please see:
