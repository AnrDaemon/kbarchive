======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SQL Server version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you perform a BatchUpdate from an rdoResultSet object to a Microsoft SQL
Server 7.0 database, the BatchCollisionCount property is set incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem you can use Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects to
connect to SQL Server 7.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0, create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is
   added by default.

2. Remove Form1, and then add a standard code module.

3. From the Project menu, click References. In the References dialog box, select
   Microsoft Remote Data Object 2.0.

4. Paste the code that follows into the code window for the module.

   NOTE: Make sure that you modify the Connect property to connect to your SQL
   Server 7.0 server:

   Public Sub Main()
       Dim cn As New rdoConnection
       Dim rs As rdoResultset
       
       cn.CursorDriver = rdUseClientBatch
       cn.Connect = "driver={sql server};server=ServerName;" & _
                    "database=pubs;uid=username;pwd=password;"
       cn.EstablishConnection
       
       Set rs = cn.OpenResultset("SELECT * FROM Authors", rdOpenKeyset, rdConcurBatch)
       cn.Execute "UPDATE Authors SET au_lname = 'NewLastName'"
           
       rs.MoveFirst
       rs.Edit
       rs!au_lname = "* RS UPDATE 1 *"
       rs.Update
       
       rs.MoveNext
       rs.Edit
       rs!au_lname = "* RS UPDATE 2 *"
       rs.Update
       
       rs.MoveNext
       rs.Edit
       rs!au_lname = "* RS UPDATE 3 *"
       rs.Update
       
       rs.BatchUpdate
       
       If (rs.BatchCollisionCount = 3) Then
           Debug.Print "BatchCollisionCount PASSED!! Count = " & _
               rs.BatchCollisionCount
       Else
           Debug.Print "BatchCollisionCount FAILED!! Count = " & _
               rs.BatchCollisionCount
       End If
   End Sub

5. Run the application.

6. From the View menu, click Immediate Window.

RESULTS: In the Immediate (Debug) window, note that the BatchCollisionCount is
reported to be zero (0) or one (1). However, the BatchCollisionCount should be
3.
