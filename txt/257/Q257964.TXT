   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to permanently change your terminal server client Input Locales in
Regional Settings to EN English (Australian), you may be unable to do so. If the
Australian input locale is installed on the console, the terminal server client
can add it, but if the you click "Set as default" on your terminal server client
to make it the default input locale, it only retains this setting during that
session and reverts to "US" the next time you log on.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the default locale must be set in the registry of
the terminal server client, not in the registry of the terminal server client
session.

NOTE: Australia is a locale that is only mapping to the "US" keyboard. Because of
this, a new locale must be created on the terminal server computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. On the terminal server client computer, set the value of the Keyboard Layout
   (REG_SZ) value in the following registry key to "00000c09" (the locale ID for
   English Australia):

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client

2. On the Terminal Server console, add a key that is named "00000c09" to the
   following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layouts

3. Create two REG_SZ entries, one named "Layout File" with the value "KBDUS.DLL"
   and another named "Layout Text" with the value "US".
