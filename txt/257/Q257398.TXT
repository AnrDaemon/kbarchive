TITLE   :SFU: Cannot Use ALT+CONTROL Keys from Within a Telnet Session
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Telnet clients may be unable to use ALT+CONTROL key combinations in advanced
character-mode programs (such as Edit.com) from within a Telnet session to a
Windows NT Services for UNIX-based Telnet server.

CAUSE
=====

The Telnet client is not using VTNT emulation mode. VTNT emulation is the
preferred emulation type for using the Windows NT command shell (Cmd.exe) from
within a Telnet session. VTNT emulation is the only emulation type that provides
the full functionality of advanced character-mode programs such as Edit.com.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the Telnet client that is included on the Microsoft Windows NT Services
for UNIX CD-ROM on the client workstation. To set the terminal emulation type to
VTNT, start a Telnet session and type "SET TERM VTNT" (without the quotation
marks) at the Microsoft Telnet prompt. You can then open a connection to the
Telnet server as usual.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Presently, VTNT emulation is only available with the Telnet client and server
components included on the Microsoft Windows NT Services for UNIX add-on pack.
It is not included with the GUI-based Telnet client program that is included
with Windows NT, Microsoft Windows 95, and Microsoft Windows 98.
