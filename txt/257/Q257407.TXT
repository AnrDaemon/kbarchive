KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Team Folders Wizard to create a team folder, you may either be
prompted for your user name and password or you may receive the following error
message when you publish your files to the Web server:

   Web Publishing Error:
   Error: occurred during HTTP publishing of Web files. Select OK to try another
   destination to publish your files to or Cancel to exit the wizard.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the permissions that are necessary to publish files to
the target folder are not enabled properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, perform the following steps on the computer running
Microsoft Internet Information Service (IIS):

1. In Windows Explorer, locate the InetPub folder.

2. Right-click the folder, and then click Properties.

3. Click the Security tab, and then click Permissions.

4. Click Everyone, click Remove, click OK, and then click OK again.

5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 for the Wwwroot folder and, if applicable, the
   subfolder that you created under the Wwwroot folder to store your team
   folders data.

6. Restart the server.

7. In Windows Explorer, grant the Everyone group Full Control permission for the
   InetPub and Wwwroot folders. If you created a subfolder for your team folders
   under InetPub\Wwwroot, then grant the Everyone group permissions for that
   subfolder also.
