TITLE   :FIX: Dynamically Loaded UserControl Does Not Send Changes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbActiveX kbCtrl kbDatabase kbDataBinding kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVBDB kbDSupport kbVS600sp4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a UserControl is dynamically loaded onto a form, the edits made in a
data-bound textbox are not communicated back to the data source in certain
scenarios. If you click from an edited data-bound textbox to a data-bound
UserControl, the data you have changed in the textbox is not communicated back
to the datasource. Tabbing away from the data-bound textbox to the data-bound
UserControl does allow the edits to be communicated back to the datasource and
does update the data.

This behavior is seen in the compiled version (.exe file) of the application. The
behavior is not seen when the application is running within the development
environment.
