TITLE   :FIX: Update Fails for Text Column w/CursorDriver at rdUseODBC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft SQL Server version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When editing a column of type Text in SQL Server 7.0 through a Remote Data
control or an rdoEnvironment object opened with the CursorDriver property set to
rdUseODBC, the update fails.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the ODBC cursor library uses all columns to build
the WHERE clause. For inexact types, such as Text, the driver may be unable to
locate the row.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the latest service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.

To work around the problem, use ActiveX Data Objects (ADO). Or, do not use ODBC
client-side cursors with Remote Data Objects (RDO).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest
service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, choose References, and then add a reference to the
   Microsoft Remote Data Objects 2.0 library.

3. Remove Form1, and add a new module.

4. Insert the following code into the module:

   Option Explicit

   Public Sub Main()
       Dim cn As New rdoConnection
       Dim rs As rdoResultset
       Dim strTemp As String
       
       cn.CursorDriver = rdUseODBC
       cn.Connect = "driver={sql server};server=MyServer;database=pubs;uid=sa;pwd=;"
       cn.EstablishConnection
       Set rs = cn.OpenResultset("SELECT au_lname FROM Authors", _
           rdOpenKeyset, rdConcurRowVer)
       strTemp = "NewLastName"
       rs.Edit
       rs!au_lname = strTemp
       rs.Update
       rs.Requery
       If rs!au_lname <> strTemp Then
           Debug.Print "Test FAILED!! -- Strings don't match"
       Else
           Debug.Print "Test PASSED!! -- Strings match"
       End If
       
       rs.Close
       cn.Close
   End Sub

If the source database for the data is SQL Server 7.0, the test fails.
