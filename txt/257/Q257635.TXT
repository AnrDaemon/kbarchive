Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Place a Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) Data Control on the form. Make
   sure that the source has several records, enough to require you to scroll.

3. Place a Microsoft DataGrid Control on your form, and then bind the DataGrid
   control to the ADO Data Control.

4. Set the DataGrid's AllowAddNew property to TRUE.

5. Run the project, scroll down the grid to the bottom, and then add a new
   record.

6. Enter a value into one of the columns.

7. Press ESC twice to:

    - Clear the field.

      -and-

    - Cancel the AddNew.

8. The focus is on the last record as expected.

9. Repeat the AddNew and Cancel.

10. The focus is still on the last record as expected.

11. Click a field in the last record. You will see that the field of the second
   to the last record is highlighted.

12. If you modify the field value, the value is written to the last record.
