MORE INFORMATION
================

This error message can also be caused by corrupted printer drivers. If you are
still experiencing this behavior after applying the hotfix, identify any
recently installed printer drivers and replace them with compatible printer
drivers from the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM. For example, the Hewlett-Packard (HP)
4si and 5si drivers from the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM provide basic functionality
for the HP 4000 and 8000 printers.

If you cannot find a compatible printer driver on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM,
temporarily delete any suspect printers and printer drivers from the system, and
then attempt to restart the spooler. For additional information about removing
and reinstalling printer drivers, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
