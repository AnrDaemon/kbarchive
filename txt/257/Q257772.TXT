PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCtrl kbDatabase kbDataBinding kbMDAC kbODBC _IK12473 kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVBDB kbGrpDSM

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Updates to a TextBox control that is bound to a Remote Data control fail to
update in certain instances. This behavior occurs when you use a cursor type of
rdUseClientBatch and the BatchUpdate method is called before moving the cursor
off the edited row.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are several possible workarounds for this problem:

 - Use a server-side cursor for your data access.

 - Call the MoveNext method before calling BatchUpdate.

 - Call the UpdateRow method before calling BatchUpdate.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest
service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following code uses an ODBC Datasource named Pubs that connects to the Pubs
database in SQL Server.

1. In Visual Basic, create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is added to the
   project by default.

2. From the Project menu, click to select Components. From the list of available
   Components, select Microsoft Remote Data Control 6.0.

3. Place a Remote DataControl, a Textbox, and a CommandButton control onto
   Form1. MSRDC1, Text1, and Command1 are created by default.

4. Set the following properties for MSRDC1:

   DataSourceName: Pubs
   SQL: SELECT * From Titles
   CursorDriver: 3 - rdUseClientBatch
   LockType: 5 - rdConcurBatch
   Prompt: 1 - rdDriverNoPrompt

5. Set the following properties for Text1:

   DataSource: MSRDC1
   DataField: Title

6. Add the following code to Form1's Code Window:

   Option Explicit

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
   '   MSRDC1.UpdateRow
      MSRDC1.Resultset.BatchUpdate
      MSRDC1.Refresh
   End Sub

7. Run the code. Change the value in Text1, click Command1, and note how the old
   value returns to the box. Uncomment the UpdateRow line of code, and note that
   the data remains in the box and is updated back to the database.
