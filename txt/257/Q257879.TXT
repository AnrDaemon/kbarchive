PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:w2000mscs kbClustering

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to move the group that contains the physical disk that is used
for the quorum resource, the operation may fail, and the following event may be
logged in the system event log:

   Event ID 1073 Source ClusSvc
   Microsoft Cluster Server was halted to prevent an inconsistency within the
   cluster. The error code was 5028.

This error code means that the Cluster service could not mount the quorum log on
the disk designated as the quorum disk.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the device drivers from another program are not
compatible with the Cluster service. Third-party filter drivers can prevent the
Cluster service from accessing cluster resources. Programs and tools such as
antivirus packages, quota software, and defragmentation tools are suspect.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove the third-party driver to verify that this is the
cause of the issue, or contact the manufacturer to find out if the program is
designed to run on a clustered server.
