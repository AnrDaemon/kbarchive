======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) clients may use NetWare licenses and not release
them. In this situation, the advanced power management (APM) component
establishes this connection and the Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) cannot
release the connection properly. You can use the SMSCCMBootAcct account for this
connection.

CAUSE
=====

If an NAL process opens a connection to the computer with a network resource,
APM may use the existing connection. When NAL is finished with the connection,
it drops the arbiter counters in the registry:

   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\NAL\Client\COnnections\SMSCCMBootAcct\Deviceless

This subkey may be named "Resource1." This key should contain three values:

 - The NAL path to the resource
 - The persistence count
 - The reference count

When this happens, the connection is supposed to be released and the resource key
deleted, however, because APM is using this connection, NAL cannot release it.
The connection is left behind and may be sitting in an idle state for several
hours or longer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
