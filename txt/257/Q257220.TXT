======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Newsfeeds are not supported in the Microsoft Windows 2000 version of Network
News Transfer Protocol (NNTP). Newsfeeds cannot be configured in Internet
Information Services (IIS) 5.0.

Although the Default NNTP Virtual Server properties contain "Allow feed postings"
and "Allow servers to pull news articles from this server" options, these
options and complete newsfeed capability are not available.

You can use Exchange Server or other newsfeed software for newsfeed support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The flow of items from one USENET site to another is called a newsfeed. A
newsfeed replicates items in newsgroups between host computers. One or more
servers, or hosts, running NNTP make up a USENET site.

Each USENET site that receives a newsfeed can be configured to accept and
generate an NNTP connection and newsfeed. The host computer that receives your
newsfeed is configured as the outbound host. The host computers that provide
your newsfeed are configured as the inbound hosts. A host computer can be
configured as both the inbound and outbound host.

Additional query words: newsgroup
