TITLE   :Advertisement Creation Indicates a Program Is Disabled When Not
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create an advertisement for a program, the console may indicate that
the program is disabled when it is not. Also, users are prompted to determine if
they want to enable the program. If a user chooses to enable the program, the
console actually enables some other previously disabled program, which may cause
unexpected software distribution. This condition occurs only in the following
specific circumstances:

 - A program item with an identical name exists in another package on the site.

 - The similarly named program is currently disabled.

 - The user is not using the Distribute Software Wizard.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator console incorrectly handles
program item information. The console uses the program item name to determine if
the program is disabled. This is incorrect because the program name is not
unique to a program item; the SMS Administrator console may find a different
program item during the search and incorrectly indicate that the program you are
working with is disabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
