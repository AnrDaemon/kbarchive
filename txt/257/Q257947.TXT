MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following steps reproduce this error:

1. Open a new Data project in Visual Basic. Drag-and-drop a Data Combo control,
   two ADO Data controls, and a CommandButton onto the form that is added to the
   project (frmDataEnv).

2. Set the Style property of the Data Combo to one of the following:

    - dbcDropdownCombo
    - dbcDropdownList

3. Set the ConnectionString property of the first ADO Data control (ADODC1) to
   connect to the Nwind.mdb database that is located in the Visual Basic 98
   folder. Specify the Products table in the Nwind.mdb database as its
   RecordSource.

4. Set the ConnectionString property of the second ADO Data control (ADODC2) to
   also connect to the Nwind.mdb database that is located in the Visual Basic 98
   folder. Specify the Suppliers table in the Nwind.mdb database as its
   RecordSource.

5. Set the following properties of the Data combo as specified below:

    - DataSource - ADODC1
    - DataField - SupplierID
    - RowSource - ADODC2
    - ListField - CompanyName
    - BoundColumn - SupplierID

6. Cut-and-paste the following line of code into the Click event of the
   CommandButton:

      MsgBox DataCombo1.BoundText

7. Save and run the Visual Basic project, and note that the Data Combo displays
   a List of CompanyNames from the Suppliers table.

8. Click the drop-down button on the Data Combo to display the list portion of
   the control, and then scroll down the list of items by using the vertical
   scroll bar until the currently selected element in the Data Combo is no
   longer visible in the elements that are displayed in the list portion of the
   control.

9. Click the CommandButton, and note that this collapses the list portion of the
   Data Combo control and generates the run-time error message noted in the
   "Summary" section of this article. Stop the execution of the project and
   return to the Visual Basic environment.

10. Declare a string variable by the name of BoundText in the form's General
   Declarations section. Cut-and-paste the following line of code in the Click
   event procedure of the Data Combo:

       BoundText = DataCombo1.BoundText

11. Modify the MsgBox statement in the Click event procedure of the Command
   Button to display the value of the BoundText variable instead of the
   BoundText property of the Data Combo.

12. Repeat steps 8 through 11, and note that the error message does not occur
   and that the value of the variable that is displayed reflects the value in
   the BoundText property of the Data Combo control.
