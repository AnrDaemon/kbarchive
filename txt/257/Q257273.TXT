SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Team Productivity Update (TPU) for BackOffice Server 4.5,
you may receive the following error message:

   TPUSetup

   Unable to locate the BackOffice 4.5 product directory.

   Please review any documentation accompanying your setup for more information
   on why setup may not be working properly. You might also try closing any open
   applications and run setup again.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the BackOffice Server Setup files are removed, or if the
BackOffice Program Directory value is missing from the registry. In either case,
the BackOfficeProgramDir value is missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method:

The BackOffice Server Setup Files Were Removed
----------------------------------------------

1. Insert the BackOffice Server 4.5 CD-ROM number 1, and then start BackOffice
   Setup.

2. When you are prompted to choose an installation type, choose Custom
   installation.

3. When the Component Selection screen appears, select only the BackOffice Suite
   Components.

4. After the BackOffice Suite Components are reinstalled, TPU Setup will proceed
   past the error message listed earlier in this article.

The BackOffice Server Setup Files Were Not Removed
--------------------------------------------------

1. Use Regedt32.exe to view the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\BackOffice

2. Click Add Value on the Edit menu.

3. For the String Name, enter "BackOfficeProgramDir" (without the quotation
   marks).

4. Set the Data Type to Reg_SZ, and then click OK.

5. For the String Value, enter the path of the BackOffice Program folder, and
   then click OK. Note that by default, this is the <drive>:\Program
   Files\Microsoft BackOffice folder, where <drive> is the drive where the
   BackOffice Suite Components are installed.

6. With this value in place, TPU Setup will proceed past the error message
   listed earlier in this article.
