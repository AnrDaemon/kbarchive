TITLE   :100 Percent CPU Use with Cluster Service

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you define hundreds of file share resources within a cluster, one or more
nodes in the cluster may begin to provide reduced performance. When this occurs,
Task Manager may report excessive CPU utilization by either the Clussvc.exe or
Rsrcmon.exe processes.

CAUSE
=====

On some clusters, several hundred resources may consume enough overhead to
impact performance. The number of total resources that a cluster may process
without significant overhead varies based on the abilities of the hardware.

RESOLUTION
==========

The most efficient way to create many file shares on a cluster is to create
sub-folder shares because this option can significantly reduce the number of
resources and overhead. This option also simplifies administration and disaster
recovery.

If you must use individual File Share resources for several hundred shares, it
may be necessary to add more CPUs or memory to the server.
