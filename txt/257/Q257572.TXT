======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When packaging a DHTML Project with the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW), you
receive the following error message for the Mshtml.tlb file:

   Missing Dependency Information

CAUSE
=====

Mshtml.tlb is being included incorrectly in the setup package, and the PDW is
not able to determine what dependencies there are for the file.

Mshtml.tlb does not need to be installed on target computers because it is
already installed on Windows 2000 and any computers that have Internet Explorer.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to resolve this problem:

 - You can manually deselect the Mshtml.tlb file so that it is not included in
   your setup package.

 - If you install the latest service pack for Visual Studio 6.0, the Package and
   Deployment Wizard does not pick up Mshtml.tlb.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest
service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.

   now receive the error message for the Mshtml.tlb file:
