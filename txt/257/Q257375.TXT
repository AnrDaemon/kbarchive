This procedure uses cascading style sheets technology for Microsoft Internet
Explorer 4.0 and later.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To insert a fixed watermark on your page, follow these steps:

1. In Page view, open the page on which you want to add a watermark.

2. Right-click the open page, and click Page Properties on the menu that
   appears.

3. Click the General tab. Click Style.

4. Click Format and then click Border.

In the Borders and Shading dialog box, follow these steps:
   a. Click the Shading tab. Click Browse.

   b. Select the image that you want as the watermark, and then click Open.

   c. In the Vertical Position list, click center.

   d. In the Horizontal Position list, click center.

   e. In the Repeat list, click no-repeat.

   f. In the Attachment list, click fixed.

   g. Click OK.

5. Click OK two more times.

6. Save and close the page.

7. To preview how your page will look, click "Preview in Browser" on the File
   menu.

NOTE: You can also create a watermark by selecting the Watermark check box on the
Background tab in the Page Properties dialog box (on the File menu, click
Properties). However, when you do this, the image is tiled behind your
foreground information.
