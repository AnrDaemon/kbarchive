SYMPTOMS
========

The TN5250 Service may end unexpectedly when a TN5250 client disconnects. This
problem occurs when you use the WRQ Reflections TN5250 client, although it can
also occur with other client emulators.

When the failure occurs, a Ddrwtsn32.log file indicates that a hard-coded
breakpoint occurred. For example:

   Application exception occurred:
   App: obj\i386\tn5250.exe (pid)
   When: (date) (time)
   Exception number: 80000003 (hardcoded breakpoint)

CAUSE
=====

A timing window can occur during client shutdown processing when an outstanding
TEST_RTS_AND_POST verb is cancelled and TP_ENDED is called twice in error. When
the second TP_ENDED returns an error, the TN5250 Service may force a hard-coded
breakpoint, causing the process to end.

==========
