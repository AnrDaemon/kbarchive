TITLE   :SMS: Collection Evaluator May Not Manage Custom MIF Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbCollections

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0, when a custom Management Information
Format (MIF) file is implemented at some sites in a hierarchy, but not in the
entire hierarchy, Collection Evaluator at the other sites may report errors in
the status message system because it may not insert the correct criteria for the
custom-MIF-based collection.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur in a hierarchy that consists of a central site and child
primary sites. When a custom MIF file is inserted at the central site and at one
of the child primary sites, along with collections created at the central site
that are based on the custom MIF file information that may be propagated down
the hierarchy, the sites that are unaware of the custom MIF files may start
generating a large number of error messages with status message ID 620.
Collection Evaluator may report 6 error messages, and then may report 1 error
message every 15 minutes. This cycle may be repeated indefinitely.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, implement custom MIF files to all sites in the hierarchy.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
