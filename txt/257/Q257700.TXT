======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If no domain controller is available or if the domain controller is located
across a slow link from a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 client that is
running on a site server, an advertised program may not run as scheduled.

Because this issue occurs only on site servers, this problem most often occurs on
site servers in remote offices that do not have a local domain controller.

CAUSE
=====

When a domain controller is unavailable, the Client service does not record the
process ID for Odpsys32.exe in the client's local registry. Therefore,
Smsapm32.exe refuses a named-pipe connection from Odpsys32.exe because it cannot
confirm that it has been started by the Client service. Any scheduled software
distribution does not occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

   Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, make sure that a fast, reliable connection to a
domain controller is available.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 3.
