TITLE   :SMS 2.0 Client Minimizes Full-Screen MS-DOS-Based Program
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbClient kbConfig kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Systems Management Server (SMS) client components are starting on a
computer running Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98, an MS-DOS-based
program that is running in Full-Screen mode is minimized to a button on the
taskbar. Typically, you see this behavior only if a full-screen MS-DOS-based
program is being started on the client from the StartUp group. If you then
maximize the MS-DOS-based program, it remains maximized.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, delay the starting of the full-screen MS-DOS-based
program. If possible, have users start such programs from a shortcut instead of
having the program start automatically.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
