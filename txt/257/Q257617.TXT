OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you start your Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition-based computer,
the Terminal Server service may stop responding (hang) and not permit new
connections.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the License Logging service is not responding. When
you make a connection to the Terminal Server service, it provides the client
license information to the License Logging service. If the License Logging
service is not responding, new connections time out while the Terminal Server
service waits for a reply from the License Logging service.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, click the
following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
