======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create a Microsoft Access 97 table from a Visual Basic project,
you may receive the following error message:

   -2147217900(80040e14):
   [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver] Field '(The second column name)'
   already exists in table 'HWC'

The problem does not occur with a Microsoft Access 2000 database.

This problem arises when you attempt to create a table with two columns that
contain double-byte character sets whose fields are the same length. This
problem only occurs with the Jet 4.0 OLE-DB provider and the Access ODBC driver.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest
service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Use Access 97 or the Visual Data Manager Add-In to create a blank .mdb file
   named Test in the Visual Basic 98 application folder.

2. In Visual Basic, create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by
   default.

3. Add a CommandButton control to Form1. Command1 is created by default.

4. Paste the following code into Form1's Code window:

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       Dim cn As ADODB.Connection
       Set cn = New ADODB.Connection

       'Call cn.Open("Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.3.51;Persist Security Info=False;" & _
           "Data Source=c:\program files\microsoft visual studio\vb98\Test.mdb")
       'Call cn.Open("Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Persist Security Info=False;" & _
           "Data Source=c:\program files\microsoft visual studio\vb98\Test.mdb")
       Call cn.Open("Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};" & _
           "Dbq=c:\program files\microsoft visual studio\vb98\test.mdb")
           
       'The table has two columns, each column name has 4 DBCS characters.
       'Replace the question marks in the following line with DBCS characters
       cn.Execute "Create TABLE HWC(???? DateTime,???? String(5))"
       Call cn.Close
   End Sub

5. Run the project, click the CommandButton, and note that the error message in
   the "Symptoms" section appears.
