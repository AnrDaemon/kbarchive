Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Change the default printer's default page orientation to Landscape in the
   Printers folder on Windows.

2. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

3. Add a CommandButton control to Form1.

4. Paste the following code into Form1's code window:

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
      DataReport1.PrintReport True
   End Sub

5. From the Project menu, select Add Data Environment to add DataEnvironment1 to
   the project.

6. In DataEnvironment1, right-click Connection1, and then choose Properties. Set
   the Properties of Connection1 to be the following:

    - On the Provider tab, set Provider to Microsoft Jet 4.0 OLE DB Provider.

    - Click Next.

    - On the Connection tab, set the database name to NWIND.MDB.

    - Click Test Connection to make sure you are connected to the database.

    - Click OK.

7. Right-click Connection1 and choose Add Command to add Command1.

8. Right-click Command1 and select Properties. Set the properties of Command1 to
   be the following:

    - On the General tab, change the Database object to Table.

    - Drop down the Object Name combo box and select Employees.

    - Click OK.

9. From the Project menu, select Add Data Report. DataReport1 is added by
   default.

10. Set the properties of DataReport1 to be the following:

    - Set the DataSource property to DataEnvironment1.

    - Set the DataMember property to Command1.

    - Set the ReportWidth property to 11520 (8 inches).

    - Set the LeftMargin property to 1440 (1 inch).

    - Set the RightMargin property to 1440 (1 inch).

11. If you add ReportWidth, LeftMargin, and RightMargin, the total report width
   is 10 inches, which is correct size for the Landscape orientation on
   standard letter size paper.

12. Press the F5 key to run the program.

13. Click the CommandButton that brings up the Printer dialog box. Note that the
   Page Orientation in the Printer dialog box is Portrait.
