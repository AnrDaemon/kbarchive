SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to set the DayOfWeek property of the MonthView control to one of
the enumerated constants in code, the MonthView's year changes to 1899. This
behavior starts occurring after you have changed the date in the MonthView
control.

CAUSE

When you try to set the DayOfWeek property to one of the enumerated constants,
it is actually setting the value property of the control.
