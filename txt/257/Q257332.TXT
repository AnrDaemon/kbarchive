======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you send an HTTPS request to a Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)
version 5.0 server that requests a nonexistant IP:Port combination, IIS 5.0 may
experience an access violation in W3svc.dll.

CAUSE
=====

IIS 5.0 listens to every Internet Protocol (IP) the computer has associated with
it. For Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connections, a Web server cannot send back a
friendly error to the browser, because this error should be encrypted. Each
encryption requires a certificate that is located by using the IP:PORT look-up
in a hash-table stored on the server. In this case, the look-up fails, leading
to an access violation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article
