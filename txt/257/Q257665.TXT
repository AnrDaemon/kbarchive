SYMPTOMS
========

The background wallpaper (picture) for your desktop may be stretched, and you
may be unable to find a method to turn the "stretch" feature off.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Plustab.dll file is missing or damaged and the
WallpaperStyle value in the registry is set to 2.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

Extract the Plustab.dll file from the Plus_3.cab file on your original Microsoft
Plus! for Windows 95 media to the Windows\System folder. For information about
how to do so, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Method 2
--------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Change the data value for the WallpaperStyle value in the following registry key
to 0:

   HKey_Current_User\Control Panel\Desktop
