PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport kbVS600sp4fix kbVS600sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a large project with many forms, when you click on the DataSource property of
a databound control in the Properties window, it takes a very long time before
the list appears.

CAUSE
=====

When a user clicks the DataSource drop-down list box of a databound control in
the Properties window, Visual Basic loads all of the forms in the project to
look for designers that are DataSources. Because Visual Basic does not know in
advance which forms it needs to load in order to retrieve this information, it
must load all of them. This procedure may take a long time if it occurs in a
large project that has many forms. The size at which the project exhibits this
behavior depends on available system resources.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest
service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.

forms to look for designers that are DataSources.
