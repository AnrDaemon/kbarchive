The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server, version 1.1 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If the Cluster service, Cluster Administrator, or any of the resources managed
by Cluster Administrator stops responding (hangs), you may have to stop the
Cluster service to cause resources to fail over to the other cluster node and to
prevent Cluster Administrator from hanging when you try to start it.

Any process upon which Cluster Administrator is dependent (such as being
authenticated by a primary or backup domain controller) can cause Cluster
Administrator to stop responding.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To force the Cluster service to stop, start Task Manager and note the PID number
for ***Cluster.exe*** CLUSSVC.EXE on the Processes tab. Then, use the Kill
program from the Resource Kit to "kill" the PID number for ***Cluster.exe***
CLUSSVC.EXE. The cluster then fails over to the other node.
