TITLE   :FIX: Creating an Object in a VB DLL on a Non-UI Thread
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbActiveX kbThread kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport kbVS600sp4fix kbVS600sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Standard EXE project creates a new thread (irrespective of the language
in which the thread is created), and that thread creates an object in a Visual
Basic ActiveX DLL, then the application is no longer able to show a non-modal
form.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs due to a flag underlying the App.NonModalAllowed object that
is set to be global instead of per-thread. It is set for the entire process to
the value of the last loaded thread. Because the new thread has no message
filter and no component manager, the flag is cleared and it removes the EXE's
modeless capabilities.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest
service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.
