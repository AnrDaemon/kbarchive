   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to add counters to the chart in Performance Monitor, the list
of objects and counters may be incomplete or blank.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Performance Monitor object and counter names are stored in the "Counters" in
this Registry Key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
    \Software
     \Microsoft
      \WindowsNT
       \CurrentVersion
        \Perflib
         \<LangID> (LangID 009 = U.S. English)

If the list of objects and counters available to chart in Performance Monitor is
incomplete or blank, it may be because Perflib subkeys other than the 009 subkey
exist. Performance Monitor only uses the contents of one <LangID> subkey.
Additional subkeys under the Perflib subkey are created when the Language
setting in Control Panel is modified.

To restore the default list of counters and objects in Performance Monitor, do
either of these steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

 - If you have Windows NT version 3.1:

   Delete all <LangID> subkeys except the 009 subkey.

   NOTE: As a precaution, save the Perflib subkey before deleting any of the
   <LangID> subkeys.

 - If you have Windows NT version 3.1 or 3.5:

   In Windows NT 3.5 you cannot delete any of the <LangID> subkeys.

   Change your Language setting in the International dialog box Control Panel
   back to its original setting or to the setting that includes the complete
   list of objects and counters.

 - If you have Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0:

   The Performance Monitor system counter names and explain text have been moved
   from the registry to two data files, PerfCxxx.dat and PerfHxxx.dat, located
   in the %SystemRoot%\system32 directory. They can be renamed and expanded off
   of the installation CD.


Additional query words: prodnt perfmon perflib counters corrupted perfc009.dat.
