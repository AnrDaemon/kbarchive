TITLE   :PRB: Corrupt Binary File After Merging with SourceSafe
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:3.10
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Macintosh, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for MS-DOS, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for UNIX, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Binary file is corrupted after a merge is attempted. There are two scenarios
where a merge can occur:

1. Multiple_Checkouts = Yes in the SRCSAFE.INI or SS.INI file.

-or-

2. A binary file is separated and later merged.

Binary files will become corrupt if SourceSafe attempts to merge these files.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. SourceSafe cannot read or edit binary files. These files can
only safely be edited by the creator application.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent scenario 1, put all binary files in a subproject, and put a
Multiple_Checkouts=No in the project header for that subproject. This will turn
off multiple checkouts for this subproject only.

For example, you may want to organize your projects as shown in the documentation
(User Guide Chapter 2 Overview), with a subproject containing the binary files:

        $/-
          |
          TESTDATA
             |
              - BINARIES

Such that the following would be a subproject header:

   [$/TESTDATA/BINARIES]

To do this, place the following in the SS.INI file under the subproject header
for each user:

   Multiple_Checkouts=No

Then only one person can edit that set of files.

To work around scenario 2, use the original application to accomplish the merge
manually. In some cases, you can get both versions of the file and use the
application utilities to merge the differences.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
