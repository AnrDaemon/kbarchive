TITLE   :Remote Control Works Only Once with Micromatic VTD/8 Gateway
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork smsnetmon

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Micromatic VTD/8 gateway with Microsoft Systems Management Server
version 1.0 Helpdesk Remote Control, you may not be able to take remote control
of a Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 client computer more than once.

CAUSE
=====

Network Monitor reveals that the Micromatic VTD/8 gateway forwards name requests
back onto the NetBEUI protocol, which results in a name conflict. Echoing name
request packets causes SMS Server Viewer not to work.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, disable the NetBEUI protocol on the gateway and use
TCP/IP-32 as the default protocol. For more information, contact Micromatic.
