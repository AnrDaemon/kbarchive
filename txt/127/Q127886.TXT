Schedule+ on Workstation Without Microsoft Mail Accounts
--------------------------------------------------------

   features of Schedule+. Do you want to use only the personal features of
   Schedule+ now?

2. Choose the OK button.

   NOTE: You may want to create the first account with the name USER and a
   password of PASSWORD. This allows others to know the Microsoft Mail password
   without using anyone's actual password.

   PASSWORD as the password. Do not select the Remember Password check box. You
   receive the error message

   Your message file could not be found.

4. Choose OK.

5. In the Open Message File dialog box, choose the New button. You receive the
   following message:

   Warning: The existence of multiple message files can result in a loss of
   database integrity. Delete all other message files. Your new message file can
   be found in the C:\<WINDOWS>\MSMAIL.MMF.

6. Choose OK. You receive the following message:

   A new file has been created for you. Your password has been set to 'password'.
   You can change it by using the Change Password command.

7. Choose OK. From the Schedule+ Options menu, choose General Options. Select
   Startup Off-Line and then choose OK.

8. Exit and sign out of Schedule+.

9. Start Schedule+.

10. In the Microsoft Mail Sign In screen, enter USER as the user name and
   PASSWORD as the password. You receive the following error message:

   This message file is a backup file. Would you like to make it your primary
   message file?

11. Choose the Yes button. Exit and sign out of Schedule+.

12. Start Schedule+.

13. In the Microsoft Mail Sign In screen, enter a new user's name as the user
   name and PASSWORD as the password.

14. Choose OK. You receive the following error message:

   specified in your SCHDPLUS.INI file.

15. Choose OK.

   <username>.CAL. You receive the following message:

   A new file has been created for you. Your password has been set to
   'password'. You can change it by using the Change Password command.

17. Choose OK.

   NOTE: The Microsoft Mail message file and the Schedule+ file both have a
   password of PASSWORD. If you leave these passwords both set to PASSWORD,
   users will not need to confirm the Schedule+ password when they start
   Schedule+.

18. To change the Schedule+ password, choose Change Password from the Schedule+
   Options menu. You will be prompted for the current password and the new
   password you want to use.

   NOTE: When the user logs in to Schedule+, he or she needs to use his or her
   Mailbox name and PASSWORD as the password and then enter his or her
   Schedule+ password in the Confirm Password box.
