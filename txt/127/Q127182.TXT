======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Ancient Lands for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There is no Copy Text function in Microsoft Ancient Lands version 1.0. The Copy
option is available only for pictures found in the Picture Gallery.

CAUSE
=====

By design, Ancient Lands does not have a Copy Text option. This is because all
screens in Ancient Lands are large color pictures, and do not have separate text
files. As a workaround, you can copy the entire screen by using the Print Screen
button.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copying Text
------------

1. To copy the active window containing the desired text, press the ALT+PRINT
   SCREEN keys on the keyboard.

   NOTE: You do not see anything happen on screen.

   NOTE: For information about the Copy and Paste commands, see your Windows
   printed documentation or online Help.

2. Open Microsoft Paintbrush, which is usually located in the Accessories group
   of Program Manager.

   If you are using Windows 95, do the following to open Microsoft Paint:
   a. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Accessories.

   b. Click Paint

3. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

4. The picture can be printed, or saved as a bitmap image (.bmp). For more
   information, see you Paintbrush Help.

Copy Pictures
-------------

1. Clicks Options on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.

2. In the Options dialog box, click Picture Gallery.

3. Click the Copy Picture button, which is located in the lower-left of the
   Picture Gallery dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All of the Ancient Lands screens are in the form of DIBs (Device Independent
Bitmaps). A .DIB file format is designed to ensure that bitmap graphics created
using one application can be loaded and displayed in another application,
exactly the way the image appeared in the originating application. When saving
the image within Paintbrush, the file becomes a bitmap (.BMP).
