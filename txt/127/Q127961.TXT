When you install version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows on a system
that already contains version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, you may receive
the following error near the end of setup before you are asked to provide a data
disk:

   An error occurred preventing complete installation of MS Mail

Setup does not complete, and it has placed a MSMAILPV.INI file in the \WINDOWS
directory.

The MSMAILPV.INI searches for a file called FILES.INI in the following
directories:

   \WINDOWS\MSMAIL \MSRMT
   \WINDOWS\MSMAIL \MSMAIL

FILES.INI is used to provide transport information.

RESOLUTION
==========

2. Add the following to the [Transport] section of the MSMAILPV.INI file:

   MSRMT=Microsoft Mail Remote

   Save the file.

3. Execute MAILDRV.EXE in the Microsoft Mail Remote installation directory.

4. Select Microsoft Mail Remote in the Installed Mail Drivers Section of the
   Mail System Selector dialog box. Select the Set As Current Mail Driver
   button, or double-click the Microsoft Mail Remote driver.
