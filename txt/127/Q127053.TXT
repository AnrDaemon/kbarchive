TITLE   :Two Keyboard Components Appear in Control Panel
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::1.0,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Natural Keyboard with IntelliType software version 1.0
under Windows NT version 3.5, two keyboard components appear in Control Panel;
Keyboard and Keyboards.

CAUSE
=====

The Natural Keyboard Setup adds the Keyboards (KBD32.CPL) component, but does
not remove the Keyboard component.

The Natural Keyboard Setup attempts to disable the existing Control Panel
Keyboard component by modifying the Registry. However, a cache mechanism
implemented to speed up the loading of Control Panel components in Windows NT
version 3.5 does not allow the Control Panel Keyboard component to be disabled.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add the /CACHE switch to the Control Panel Command
Line in the Program Manager Program Item Properties dialog box. For example:

   CONTROL.EXE /cache

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
