SUMMARY
=======

When you are installing Windows 95 on a computer that has an Orchid Vidiola
Capture card, Setup may stop responding (hang) during the hardware detection
routine.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Orchid Vidiola Capture card is not supported for Setup's hardware detection
routine. When Setup sends a detection query to this card, the card returns an
invalid value that causes the hardware detection routine to hang. You must turn
off and restart the computer and run Setup again, selecting the Smart Recovery
option, to continue. Setup then skips the detection of the Orchid Vidiola
Capture card.
