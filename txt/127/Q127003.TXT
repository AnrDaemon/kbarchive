TITLE   :PC Ext: Mailbox Name Truncated in CALLIN.LOG
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a remote mail user calls in, the External program records only the first
nine characters of the mailbox ID in the Connection field of the CALLIN.LOG. If
a company uses a ten character mailbox naming convention, and the first nine
characters are not unique, it makes it difficult for the Administrator to
identify the remote user who called in.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use ten character mailbox names. If you must use ten character mailbox
names and must identify the remote user uniquely, enable logging on External,
and check the SESSION.LOG. The SESSION.LOG contains all ten characters of the
mailbox name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in EXTERNAL.EXE version 3.2.16,
included with version 3.2 of Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
