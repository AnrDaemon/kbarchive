OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running the hardware detection portion of Setup, or when you select
the Automatically Detect Installed Hardware option in the Add New Hardware
Wizard, the computer stops responding (hangs).

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you have a Relialogic XL-220 or XL-221 SCSI card
installed in the computer. The hardware detection routine detects these cards as
a Mitsumi CD-ROM controller card and then receives incorrect information from
the card.

RESOLUTION
==========

Select the Install Specific Hardware option in the Add New Hardware Wizard or
Setup, and then do not choose to detect SCSI cards or CD-ROM controllers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Relialogic has been notified of this problem. They are working on BIOS revisions
and Windows 95 drivers for these cards.
