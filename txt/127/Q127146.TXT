SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot use the Options button to copy or print the 1994 All-Star Game Line
Score table in the 1994 All-Star Game article. When you choose Options, the
Options dialog box does not open and display Copy and Print commands.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Choose Almanac from Contents.

2. Select the All Star Games icon on the right of the screen.

3. Click the 1994 All-Star Game Line Score table icon to display the table (this
   icon is next to Ken Griffey, Jr.'s picture).

4. Press and hold down the ALT key while pressing the PRINT SCREEN key
   (ALT+PRINT SCREEN) to copy the table to the Clipboard.

5. The table can then be pasted into Microsoft Write, Microsoft Paintbrush, or
   any Windows-based word processor, and printed from that application.

   NOTE: Only the visible portion of the table will be copied to the Clipboard.

For more information about using the Windows ALT+PRINT SCREEN key combination,
see your Windows printed documentation or online Help.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Complete Baseball, 1995
edition. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
