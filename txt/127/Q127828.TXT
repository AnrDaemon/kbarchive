TITLE   :Cannot Connect to Share With Single User Access
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a share and set the user limit to one, and then a user connects to
the share and runs a program or batch file, other users cannot connect until the
first user shuts down Windows NT or a time-out occurs. After the first user runs
a program or batch file and disconnects from the share, Server Manager shows
that no one is connected or using that resource. Other users who attempt to
connect to the share receive a message stating that the maximum number of users
are connected to the share.


If a user connects to the share but does not run a program, the problem does not
occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.5. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: prodnt shutdown period
