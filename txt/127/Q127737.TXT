The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b, 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for Windows, you cannot sort
the shared folders.


WORKAROUND
==========

You can use the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation to sort the
shared folders, and then use the newly sorted folders in the Windows client.

To sort the shared folders
--------------------------

1. In the MS-DOS client, logon as the owner.

   If the owner of the file is not known, run the Administrators program
   (ADMIN.EXE) against this postoffice and choose Folders, Print. This will
   print a listing of all folders with their corresponding owners name.

2. Choose Options, Folder, Modify, and select the desired shared folder. Change
   the sort order.

3. Update the folder, and exit the MS-DOS client.

4. Run the Windows client.

   The Windows client will now show the modified sort of the shared folders.
