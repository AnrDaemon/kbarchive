DOCUMENT:Q127845  12-FEB-2000  [foxpro]
TITLE   :PRB: Property is Ignored Under Program Control
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Assigning a value to a property in a class definition has no effect at run time.
The value of the property is ignored.

CAUSE
=====

The property, or any property that affects it, is misspelled or not assigned to
the correct member object. A new property is therefore declared, and no error
message is generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use the DISPLAY OBJECTS command or the Amembers() function to verify
that all of the attributes of an object hold the correct value.

For more information about DISPLAY OBJECTS or Amembers(), refer to Visual FoxPro
Help.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

When running the following sample program, the ToolTipText property does not
display any text. The reason for this behavior is that the ShowTips property,
which specifies whether or not a tool tip can be displayed for a control, is set
as a property of a control instead of a property of the form.

      frmTest = CREATEOBJECT("FormToolTip")
      frmTest.Show
      READ EVENTS

      DEFINE CLASS FormToolTip AS FORM
          * Uncomment the line below for the ToolTip to display.
          * ShowTips = .T.
            Caption="No tool Tip for the Text Box"
       ADD OBJECT text1 AS textbox
          * Incorrect setting for the ShowTips property
           text1.ShowTips = .T.
           text1.ToolTipText = "This is the Text"
           text1.left=(thisform.width-this.text1.width)/2 && center text box
       PROCEDURE Destroy
           CLEAR EVENTS
       ENDPROC
      ENDDEFINE
