SUMMARY
=======

When a Plug and Play NIC, such as the Realtek Longshine NIC, is configured to
use an NDIS 2 driver, you may receive an error message similar to the following
when you start your computer:

   \DEV\MS2000$ Error: Hardware does not respond.
   Error loading device driver NE2000.DOS
   Error 7306: the driver failed to initialize...

In spite of this error message, full network functionality is available in
Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Plug and Play card is disabled until it is turned on either by the BIOS or a
software driver. In this case, the NDIS 2 driver, NE2000.DOS, does not turn on
the card. Windows 95 later initializes the NDIS 3 driver, which then activates
the card, enabling connectivity. The error message is correct at the moment it
is generated, but another driver subsequently corrects the problem.

This behavior occurs only if the card has been manually configured for a
real-mode 16-bit NDIS driver with protected-mode protocols only. In a
configuration with real-mode protocols, such as DLC, the protocols are not
available.

Note that the error message is ordinarily hidden by the startup screen. To see
this error message you must press the ESC key or add the line "LOGO=0" in the
MSDOS.SYS file.
