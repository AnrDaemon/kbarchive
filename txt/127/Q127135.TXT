======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you load version 1.04 of the driver for the Ositech Jack of Diamonds PCMCIA
network and modem card, you receive the following error message:

   Setup Error 402: An information (.INF) file is damaged.

CAUSE
=====

The OEMSETUP.INF file that was shipped with this card contains incorrect
information about real-mode and enhanced-mode driver types.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you are setting up Windows to use this card, override the default value of
"Real and Enhanced Mode NDIS Driver." Change the setting to "Real Mode NDIS
Driver" in the Drivers portion of Network Setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Ositech originally planned to ship a real-mode and enhanced-mode driver for this
card, and shipped the correct OEMSETUP.INF file for this driver. The driver that
comes with the card, however, is a real-mode driver only.

This problem is corrected in version 2.1 of the drivers. To obtain the updated
drivers, contact Ositech Technical Support.
