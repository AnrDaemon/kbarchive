TITLE   :Phone Number Does Not Appear in Modem Log File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 msnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you select the Record A Log File check box in your modem's properties, the
log file (MODEMLOG.TXT) shows the phone number you dialed as "ATDT#######."

CAUSE
=====

The phone number is shown this way to add security for credit card numbers used
for long-distance dialing.

WORKAROUND
==========

NOTE: You should use this workaround for troubleshooting purposes only.

You can work around this behavior by typing "E1" (without the quotation marks) in
the Extra Settings box in your modem's properties. Adding "E1" causes the phone
number you dialed to be shown in the MODEMLOG.TXT file.

The following steps demonstrate how to select the Record A Log File check box and
add the "E1" setting:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Modems icon.

3. Click the Properties button.

4. Click the Connection tab.

5. Click the Advanced button.

6. Click the Record A Log File check box to select it.

7. In the Extra Settings box, type "E1" (without the quotation marks).

8. Click OK until you return to the Modems Properties dialog box.

9. Click the Close button.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
