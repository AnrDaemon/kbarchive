SUMMARY
=======

MAPIVIM.DLL is a dynamic-link library file that is included with the Microsoft
Office Standard and Professional packages. MAPIVIM.DLL is designed to allow
Microsoft Office applications, such as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word running
on PC Networks that have vendor independent messaging (VIM) electronic mail
messaging systems (Lotus Corporation's CC:Mail, for example), to have limited
electronic mail functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MAPIVIM.DLL is not a published application programming interface (API). Although
MAPIVIM.DLL was designed as a subset of Message Application Program Interface
(MAPI), it was not designed for the development of messaging applications on VIM
electronic mail environments. The use of MAPIVIM.DLL as a software development
tool is not supported by Microsoft, nor can Microsoft guarantee the results from
using MAPIVIM.DLL as an API.
