TITLE   :Mouse Hangs After Windows 95 Hardware Detection
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Windows 95 on a computer using Viva Computers' VITEX
RS232 (HMC83451) serial card, the mouse stops responding (hangs) after Setup
finishes its hardware detection if the mouse is installed on COM1.

CAUSE
=====

Setup detects the COM1 port on the VITEX RS232 card as a parallel port because
of the addressing scheme used on the card, causing the mouse to stop responding.

WORKAROUND
==========

To install Windows 95 on a computer containing this card, the mouse must be
installed on COM2 in order to use the mouse after Setup's hardware detection.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The VITEX RS232 serial card has two chips, a UART 16550 and an RS232 (HMC83451).
The card supports two serial RS232 ports and one printer port. Because of the
addressing scheme used on the card, Setup detects the COM1 port as a printer
port.

According to Viva Computers, the VITEX RS232 (HMC83451) card has been
discontinued and has been replaced by the VITEX RS232 (HMC83450) card, which
does not include a printer port.
