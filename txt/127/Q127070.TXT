SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Pioneer Corporation Multi-Disk CD-ROM drive model numbers
DRM-6OO, DRM-600A, DRM-602x, and DRM-604x with more than one of the composer CDs
inserted in the device, the system will not be able to find the CDs, except the
number 5 CD, and you may receive the error message:

   Please place the correct disk in the drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, verify the following lines are present in the specified
.INI files.

NOTE: Updates can be made by opening the files in a text editor such as Notepad.

SYSTEM.INI
----------

   [MCI]
   CDAudio0=mcicda.drv 0
   CDAudio1=mcicda.drv 1
   CDAudio2=mcicda.drv 2
   CDAudio3=mcicda.drv 3
   CDAudio4=mcicda.drv 4
   CDAudio5=mcicda.drv 5

CONTROL.INI
-----------

   [Userinstallable.drivers]
   CDAudio0=mcicda.drv 0
   CDAudio1=mcicda.drv 1
   CDAudio2=mcicda.drv 2
   CDAudio3=mcicda.drv 3
   CDAudio4=mcicda.drv 4
   CDAudio5=mcicda.drv 5

MPLAYER.INI
-----------

   [Devices]
   CDAudio0=17, Disk 1
   CDAudio1=17, Disk 2
   CDAudio2=17, Disk 3
   CDAudio3=17, Disk 4
   CDAudio4=17, Disk 5
   CDAudio5=17, Disk 6

In addition, remove the following lines from the specified .INI files.

NOTE: Updates can be made by opening the files in a text editor such as Notepad.

SYSTEM.INI
----------

   [MCI]
   CDAudio=mcicda.drv

CONTROL.INI
-----------

   [Userinstallable.drivers]
   CDAudio=mcicda.drv

MPLAYER.INI
-----------

   [Devices]
   CDAudio=17, CD Audio

IMPORTANT: There are two versions of MPLAYER.EXE, and the newer version modifies
MPLAYER.INI and removes any of the new CD Audio information. As a result, you
must use the older version of MPLAYER.EXE with the Pioneer Multi-Disk CD-ROM
drives listed at the top of this article.

To determine which version of MPLAYER.EXE you have, compare the file size:

 - OLD MPLAYER.EXE size is 33,312

 - NEW MPLAYER.EXE size is 117,536

Video for Windows, version 1.1e includes the NEWER version of MPLAYER.EXE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error is caused by the default settings established by the Pioneer
installation software.

Do not use Control Panel to reconfigure the [MCI]CD Audio section. Control Panel
will undo all of the above changes.

support at (800) 872-4159.
