KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbConfig smsconfig

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use RAS_SENDER with Remote Control in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.0, the RAS_SENDER fails.

CAUSE
=====

The following problems may cause RAS_SENDER to fail:

   

 - NetBEUI is not assigned to LANA 0

 - Error 642: One of your NetBIOS names is already registered on the remote
   network. Name: <xxxxxx>

   where <xxxxxx> identifies the duplicate NetBIOS name

   

 - Error 629: The port was disconnected by the remote machine

 - Cannot find the remote client with Remote Control.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problems above, do the following:

NetBEUI is not assigned to LANA 0
---------------------------------

Make sure that the NetBEUI protocol precedes Remote Access WAN Wrapper (NdisWan#)
for the LANA number and the NetBEUI protocol is assigned to LANA 0. To get more
information on changing the LANA number, query on the following words here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   LANA NUMBER SMS

Error 642
---------

Verify that these two conditions do not exist:

 - A computer with the same computer name as yours is located on the remote LAN.

 - You are physically attached to the network that you are attempting to connect
   to.

Error 629
---------

Select Network in Control Panel, and remove Remote Access Service (RAS). Restart
the computer and re-install RAS. This problem occurs when the NetBIOSGateway has
not been enabled properly.

Cannot Find The Remote Client With Remote Control
-------------------------------------------------

Select Network in Control Panel, and remove RAS. Restart the computer and
re-install RAS. If you can not able find the remote client through RAS, you will
not able to find the remote client with Remote Control. This problem occurs when
the NetBIOSGateway has not been enabled.
