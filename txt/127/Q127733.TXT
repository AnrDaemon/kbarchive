-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to add an additional postoffice to your configuration, the
Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP may display the following error message in the
Administrator program:

   134 Error accessing SMTP Configuration File

CAUSE
=====

The local postoffice records are created in the MAILDATA\SMTP\LOCAL.CFG file. If
this file does not exist or is not available, or if the SMTP directory does not
exist, users will get this error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the rights to the SMTP subdirectory and ensure the file exists. If it does
not exist, you can restore the LOCAL.CFG file from a backup of the postoffice,
copy the file from the SMTP Gateway disk, or let the Administrator program
re-create it by reconfiguring the SMTP gateway.
