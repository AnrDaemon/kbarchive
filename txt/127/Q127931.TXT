TITLE   :Macintosh System 7.5 File Find Returns Error -5000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Macintosh System 7.5 File Find to access a Windows NT server with
Services for Macintosh installed, the following error message appears if you
encounter a folder or file that you do not have access to:

   Find File Reports: incorrect appletalk access for this folder.
   Server may have gone off-line -5000.

CAUSE
=====

Because Windows NT Server does not support the FpCatSearch (Catalog Search) API
(what the Macintosh client normally calls to do the File-Find), the Macintosh
client enumerates all files and folders on the disk (using the FpEnumerate API)
and filters for matches itself. Under System 7.1, if the Enumerate call on a
folder fails because a user does not have access to the folder, the Macintosh
client keeps enumerating directories that it does have access to, and continues
the search. A trace (sniff) shows that under System 7.5 Macintosh clients
display the error noted above and terminate the search when they encounter a
directory that cannot be enumerated, because the client does not have access to
the directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server version 3.5.
This problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
