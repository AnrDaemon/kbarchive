    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to instruct Microsoft Visual C++ to use a Registry key other than
the default by specifying the /I<key_suffix> option as shown in the MORE
INFORMATION section below. This allows you to specify different environments
with invocations of Visual C++. By making multiple copies of the Visual C++
icon, you can specify different environments or customization options and start
Visual C++ using these settings.

NOTE: Use of the /I switch is not supported. The /I switch is usually used to
have different environments or it can be used as to help debug problems with
Visual C++ where the default registry is suspected of being corrupted. It is not
recommended to use the /I switch in order to run different point releases of
Visual C++.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default Registry key used by Visual C++ version 2.0 is "Visual C++ 2.0" and
the default Registry key used by Visual C++ version 4.0 is "Developer." Visual
C++ version 5.0 uses the "DevStudio\5.0" key, while Visual C++ version 6.0 uses
the "DevStudio\6.0" key.

All keys are found in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER on Local Machine window under
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft.

In the properties for the Visual C++ icon, you can add the /I switch to the
Command Line field. The /I switch must be followed immediately by the extension
to the registry entry that will be used.

For example, the following switch starts Visual C++ using the "Visual C++
2.0_Test" key:

      /I_Test

The first time Visual C++ is started with this switch it will create the "Visual
C++ 2.0_Test" key using the default settings. At this point, you will have two
keys, the original "Visual C++ 2.0" key and the "Visual C++ 2.0_Test" key.
Future invocations of Visual C++ using the /I_Test switch will use the existing
"Visual C++ 2.0_Test" key, taking advantage of customizations that are specific
to that key.

CAUTION: Don't make modifications to the Registry by hand. The Registry is
intended to be edited only by the application that uses it.
