TITLE   :Setting BDC to be WINS Proxy Agent May Cause Broadcast Storms
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

IP broadcast storms can occur when non-WINS clients attempt to log on if Enable
WINS Proxy Agent is selected in the Advanced configuration dialog box on a
Windows NT version 3.5 Backup Domain Controller (BDC). If multiple backup domain
controllers (BDCs) are running WINS proxy agent, then the servers may crash with
a STOP message 0xA. The stack trace might look like the following:

CAUSE
-----

The WINS proxy code does not check to see if the datagram it receives is from
another WINS proxy agent. This allows the same datagrams to be repeatedly
forwarded.

This problem occurs only if the BDC is a WINS proxy agent.

WORKAROUND
----------

To work around this problem, configure another server to be the WINS proxy
agent.

STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
