The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5

Internal modems used with Windows NT require that serial port 1 or serial
port 2 be disabled. Compaq Prosignia EISA configuration utilities prior to
version 2.22 revision E fail to disable the specified port. The port is
reported as available in Control Panel (Ports) even though the EISA
configuration utility reports it disabled.

A new version of the EISA configuration utility (version 2.22 revision E)
is available on the Compaq FTP server (FTP.COMPAQ.COM
\pub\softpaq\diagnostic-setup) and the Compaq bulletin board system (BBS)
at (713) 378-1418. The updated EISA configuration utility is in the
compressed file SP1016.ZIP. After you uncompress the file, run SP1016.EXE
and then follow the directions in README3H.1ST.

Additional query words: prodnt 3.10 com comm config com1 com2
