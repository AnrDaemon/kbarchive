TITLE   :Err Msg: Cannot Create This File When This File Already Exists
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to establish trusts among a number of domains using User
Manager for Domains, the following error message appears:

   Cannot create this file when this file already exists

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you attempt establish a trust with a domain that has
the same domain security identification (SID) information as another domain that
is already trusted, or has the same local Domain SID. This problem occurs when
you:

 - Rename a domain and the trust to the previous name is still in a trust
   relationship.

 - Split a single domain into two domains by simply renaming the domain on some
   backup domain controller (BDC) and promoting it to a primary domain
   controller (PDC). In this case both domains have the same Domain SID.

 - Create two domains through an automated process. For example, you install
   Windows NT once on a PDC and then performing a disk-to-disk copy to another
   identical computer, and then change the domain name.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - If a domain is renamed and previous trust relationships still exist, break
   all trusts established by the previous domain, and re-create the trusts for
   the new domain.

   -or-

 - Reinstall all domain controllers in one of the domains (consider using a
   smaller domain). After you re-install the domain controllers, change the
   security on all objects which give permissions to objects in that domain.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

A domain SID is generated during installation when you decide if you want the
newly installed computer to be the PDC of a new domain. If there is no domain
reachable on the network with that domain name, a new SID is generated. If you
decide you want the computer to be a BDC, it browses the network for a PDC of a
domain with that name and use that same domain SID. Once a SID is generated for
a domain it does not change. This means that if you change a domain's name, it
retains the same domain SID.
