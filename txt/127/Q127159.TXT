TITLE   :Attempt to Connect to Telnet Times Out
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to a Telnet server using the Windows NT version 3.5
Telnet client utility, the connection attempt times out.

CAUSE
=====

A non-terminating acknowledgment (ACK) loop of Telnet IAC commands is initiated
between the Windows NT computer and the Telnet server. This problem may be due
to these reasons:

 - The Telnet server is sending an ACK when it receives a request to enter a
   mode that it is already in.

 - The Windows NT Telnet client utility is not keeping track of previous IAC
   command sequence(s).


WORKAROUND
==========

Contact the manufacturer of the Telnet server for more information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
