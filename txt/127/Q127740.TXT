-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following problems have been observed using SNA Server 2.0 and 2.1 with an
X.25 connection supported by Eicon WAN Services V3R2 (over an Eicon adapter):

 - When SNA Server is configured to autostart, it stop responding (hangs) at
   Windows NT start up. SNA Admin may hang indefinitely with an hourglass or
   clients may receive an XCLOCK status in their 3270 emulator when opening a
   session.

 - Problems activating PUs, or random 3270 LUs configured off an X.25 connection
   supported by the Eicon adapter may stop responding (hang) or fail to work
   when opened by an SNA Server 3270 client.

 - Problems with SNA Server error recovery when an X.25 call fails.

CAUSE
=====

These problems occur with Eicon WAN Services V3R2 and V3R2a.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct these problems, update to Eicon WAN Services V3R2a, and obtain other
updates to the X.25 link service (ECX25.DLL) and X.25 and HDLC protocols
(HDLC.ELM, HDLCBIOS.ELM, X25.ELM, X25BIOS.ELM) from Eicon Corporation.
