TITLE   :PC DynAd: Dynadmin Does Not Allow Blank Admin Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log into the Dynadmin program (DYNADMIN.EXE) with an Administrator's
account that does not have a password, Dynadmin will prompt you for a password.
If you press ENTER, Dynadmin will return you to the MS- DOS prompt. However, the
Administrator's program (ADMIN.EXE) will launch with the same account
information.

CAUSE
=====

When enhanced security is enabled, Dynadmin does not properly validate an Admin
account without a password.

RESOLUTION
==========

Always use a password with the Admin account for Dynadmin, or specify DrivesUNC
or DrivesNovell as the dynamic connection parameter. This parameter can be used
with either the External or Dispatch programs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in DYNADMIN.EXE, included with
version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
