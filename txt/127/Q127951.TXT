The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Connection Name Utility is used to import Microsoft Mail for
PC Networks gateway names into Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks. These
names will first appear in the Gateway Recipients screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These imported gateway names will appear in the server's All list or global
address list when the server rebuilds its global address list. However, this
process can take a short period of time, depending on the volume on your
server.

To verify that the new names have been added and that modifications and deletes
have taken place, look at the list of names in the Gateway Recipients screen
when you sign in as Network Manager. From the Mail menu, choose Gateway: Gateway
Recipients. The list of names in this window can be considered the master list
of gateway names for all gateways.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
