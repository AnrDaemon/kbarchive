TITLE   :PRB: Type Mismatch with Default Prop of VB4 Data Access Object
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Some data access objects in Visual Basic for Windows version 4.0 no longer have
the default "Name" property. Instead, these objects now have a default
collection. This change can lead to "Type Mismatch" (Error 13) or "Invalid
Argument" (Error 3001) errors when attempting to run your code.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add the name of the property you want to
reference.

For example, use this:

      MsgBox Data1.Database.TableDefs(0).Name

instead of this:

      MsgBox Data1.Database.TablesDefs(0)

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a data access object in Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 has a collection
as a property, the collection is now the default property. There is no longer
support for default properties on any objects except Field, Parameter and
Property objects.

This is a change in behavior from Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0 where the
"Name" property was the default property for TableDef object.

Having a default collection allows the user to implement a short hand syntax for
referencing into the collection.

For example, this:

      MsgBox Data1.Database.TableDefs(0).Fields(0).Name

can be written as this:

      MsgBox Data1.Database.TableDefs(0)(0).Name
