TITLE   :PC Mac: Case Sensitivity on Some Networks, such as UNIX
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Mac OS (ALL) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh
workstation, you may experience one or more or the following symptoms if the
Mail postoffice is located on a UNIX server:

1. The workstation software takes an unusually long time to load.

2. When you try to view a message, you receive the following error: Cannot open
   mail message possibly previously deleted

3. Your address lists may be empty.

CAUSE
=====

The problem may be caused by case sensitivity between the Macintosh client and
the UNIX server.

Some network operating systems will not allow a file to be created in all
uppercase letters. Version 3.0.3 (or later) of the Macintosh client has been
modified for these types of networks to allow the client to create filenames in
lowercase letters if LOWRCASE.GLB exists in the GLB subdirectory of the Mail
postoffice.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify the use of the Macintosh client version 3.0.3. If you do not have version
3.0.3 (or later), you can download MACLIENT.HQX or MACLIENT.SEA (self-extracting
files) on the following services:

 - Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet

   On the www.microsoft.com home page, click the Support icon.
   Click Knowledge Base, and select the product.
   Enter kbfile MACLIENT.HQX, and click GO!
   Open the article, and click the button to download the file.

 - Internet (anonymous FTP)

   ftp ftp.microsoft.com
   Change to the Softlib/Mslfiles folder.
   Get MACLIENT.HQX

 - The Microsoft Network

   On the Edit menu, click Go To, and then click Other Location.
   Type "mssupport" (without the quotation marks).
   Double-click the MS Software Library icon.
   Find the appropriate product area.

For additional information about downloading, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services


You should also verify the existence of LOWRCASE.GLB in the GLB subdirectory of
the Mail postoffice. If it does not exist, create the file. For additional
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q127079 PC Mac: Purpose and Location of LOWRCASE.GLB

Verify the Mail postoffice is mounted on the Macintosh desktop. If the client is
using a third-party Chooser extension to mount the postoffice, we cannot
guarantee client functionality. If the third-party Chooser extension has a case
sensitive option, enable this option, or contact the manufacturer of the Chooser
extension.
