The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro version 3.0 introduces several new data types including
Character(binary) and Memo(binary). This article describes the purpose and
implementation of these two new data types.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Character(binary) and Memo(binary) data types are provided for fields that
should not be translated if the table is opened using a different code page. If
the table is converted to another code page, the binary fields will not be
translated. In all other respects, the Character(binary) and Memo(binary) fields
are identical to the existing Character and Memo fields.

You might use binary fields to store:

 - Unsupported graphic images. For example, SQL SERVER contains unsupported
   graphic images that could be selected into a memo field.

 - Encrypted passwords that use the extended ASCII character set.

 - Compiled code.

 - FoxPro commands that contain strings that use the extended character set. For
   example, if a memo field or character field contains FoxPro code that
   references field names, these field names would be changed by a change in a
   code page if they used characters from the extended character set. However,
   the field names of the tables themselves would not be changed by a change in
   a code page.

Using the Table Designer in Visual FoxPro, the Character(binary) and Memo(binary)
field types may be selected from the data Type drop down list.

To specify that a field is going be binary with the CREATE or ALTER TABLE
commands, use the NOCPTRANS clause, as in this example:

      CREATE TABLE mytab (cLastName C(35) NOCPTRANS))

This creates the cLastName field with a data type of Character(Binary).

The TYPE function will return 'M' or 'C' for the binary memo or binary character
field. This return value is the same as for a regular memo or character field.
