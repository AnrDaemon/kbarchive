-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you unlock Automap street maps, you have the option to back up purchase
details to a floppy disk. Then, if you need to reinstall Automap or recover your
list of purchased maps, you can use the Recover functionality of the Install
program to restore the purchase details from the backup floppy.

Ordinarily, the Recover button should appear on initial screen of the Install
program. Sometimes, however, that button is either not available (dimmed) or
does not appear. In those cases you can start the Recover process manually.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To recover your unlocked maps using your backup disk, do the following:

1. Reinstall Automap as though it were a first-time installation by choosing Run
   from the File menu in Program Manager.

   Type the following in the Command Line box:

   "<d>:\install" (without the quotation marks)

   where <d> is the letter of your CD-ROM drive. Choose OK.

2. Follow the screen instructions to install the program.

3. Exit Install and return to Program Manager.

4. From the File menu, choose Run. In the Command Line box, type the following
   and choose OK

   "<d>:\install recover" (without the quotation marks)

   where <d> is the letter of your CD-ROM drive.

5. The Install program starts and immediately asks for the backup disk. Insert
   the disk into the appropriate floppy disk drive and press ENTER.

6. When Recover completes, choose Exit.
