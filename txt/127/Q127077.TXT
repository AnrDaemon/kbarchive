TITLE   :PC Win: Code Page Translation Incorrect for Custom Templates
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows may display data in an
imported custom template as solid blocks.

CAUSE
=====

The solid blocks represent the characters of the original equipment manufacturer
(OEM) character set that either does not appear in the ANSI character set or
exists at a different position in the ANSI character set. Therefore, some
characters in the OEM character set cannot be displayed in Windows using an
ANSI-set font.

RESOLUTION
==========

If an application must display these characters under Microsoft Windows, an
OEM-set font is required.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.2 of the
Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For the most part, Microsoft Windows uses fonts organized according to the ANSI
character set. Windows also supports fonts that use the same OEM character set
that MS-DOS uses. The OEM character set varies between computers and depends on
the code page ROM installed on the computer. For example, computers manufactured
in the United States use a character set called Code Page 437.
