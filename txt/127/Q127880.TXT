6. While Column2 is still selected, select the Edit Box control from the Form
   Controls toolbar. Then click any row in the second column of the grid. The
   edit box is added to the second column.

7. Modify the following properties of the Column2 object:

    - Sparse: set the Sparse property to .F.

    - CurrentControl: select Edit1 from the drop-down.

    - ControlSource: select the Notes memo field.

8. Resize the height of the Grid rows to see more than one line of information.

9. Save and run the form.

   to delete.
