TITLE   :PRB: RELEASE Command Does Not Release a Form
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing the RELEASE command to release an instance variable does not release the
object referenced by the variable. If the variable holds a reference to a form
that is displayed, the form is not closed.

CAUSE
=====

Another reference to the object exists. An object is released from memory when
all of the references to this object have been released.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use the AINSTANCE() function to verify that all the references to an
object have been released. AINSTANCE() builds an array of object references.

A reference to the specified object still exists if the length of the array is
greater than 0. Another alternative is to maintain a table or an array that
updates the reference count to an object.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Following are two examples that create a reference to a form.

Example One
-----------

1. Create a form, and save it as TEST.

2. From the Command window, type:

       DO FORM TEST NAME ofrmTest1 LINKED &&Displays a form
      ofrmTest2=ofrmTest1       &&Creates a reference to ofrmTest1
      * The following command releases the variable ofrmTest1. However, the
      * form is not released because a reference exists.
      RELEASE ofrmtest1
      RELEASE ofrmtest2  && Releases the Form

Example Two
-----------

1. Copy and paste the following sample code into a PRG

      OFORM1=CREATE('testclass')
      OFORM2=OFORM1   &&Creates a reference to OFORM1
      OFORM2.SHOW     && Displays the Form

      nobject= AINSTANCE(atest1,'testclass')
      DISPLAY MEMORY LIKE atest1 && Two references to the object exist

      RELEASE OFORM2          && Form not released
      WAIT WINDOW "After OFORM2 has been released"

      RELEASE oForm1          && Form is released.
      WAIT WINDOW "After OFORM1 has been released"

      DEFINE CLASS TESTCLASS AS FORM
         Caption="Hello"
      ENDDEFINE

2. Execute the PRG.
