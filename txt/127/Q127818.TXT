======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are intermittently not able to connect to Windows NT Server version 3.5 from
your network client. If you attempt to connect from a Windows NT client, a
"Semaphore Time Out" error message appears, but no events are logged in the
System Log.


CAUSE
=====

The client computer is incorrectly sending a Session End frame in response to a
Receive Outstanding frame. This appears to happen when the client computer is in
an error condition prior to the transmission.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in the latest US Service Pack for Windows NT. For
