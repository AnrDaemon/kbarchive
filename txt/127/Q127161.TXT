TITLE   :Unable to Connect to Apple Printer Shares

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you browse the Windows NT Network Printers in Print Manager, all printer
shares including the Apple printer shares appear. If you attempt to connect to
an Apple printer share, the following error message appears:

   Could not connect to printer. The printer name is invalid.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the Apple printer name has a backslash in it, such as
"Apple LaserWriter 16\600 PS" (without quotes). The Registry creates an
additional subkey after the backslash, instead of the regular key name.
Therefore, since the print monitor does not initialize, the spooler does not
create any of the Macintosh ports.


WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Remove the printer and port from the print server using Print Manager.

2. Recreate the printer and rename it without a backslash.
