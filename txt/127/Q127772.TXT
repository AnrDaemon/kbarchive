SYMPTOMS
========

If a NetWare administrator changes the file attributes of executable files to
Execute-only, the following error message appears on any Windows NT computer
accessing the files through Client Service for NetWare or Gateway Service for
NetWare:

   The system cannot find the file
   <drive>:\<directory>\<executable file>

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Rename or remove the executable file.

2. Reinstall the file or restore the file from a previous backup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Description of the X - Execute only file attribute:

The execute only attribute is extremely sensitive and provides the highest level
of NetWare security. The execute only attribute can only be assigned by the
Supervisor to .EXE and .COM files. Execute only files cannot be copied or backed
up--just executed or deleted.

Page 135 of the Novell NetWare version 3.11 Utilities Reference states the
following:

   "once assigned, this attribute cannot be removed."
