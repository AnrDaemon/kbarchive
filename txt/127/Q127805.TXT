KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 or Windows 95 in
conjunction with the Novell NetWare shell version 4.x, you may receive the
following error message:

   NetWare Error: NWDrv-3.00-20: Problem loading or executing the NetWare
   directory services support libraries. All NetWare directory services and
   functions are disabled.

CAUSE
=====

The Netware.drv file cannot find the library files it requires to operate. This
problem can occur if you do not run the INSTALL program provided with Novell's
NWCLIENT after you set up the network in Windows for Workgroups or Windows 95.
This information applies to the NWCLIENT version dated 11/8/94 that is shipped
with Novell NetWare version 4.1.

RESOLUTION
==========

Please contact Novell to determine the proper procedure for installing the
NWCLIENT components.


MORE INFORMATION
================

During Setup, both Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 and Windows 95 copy only
the NetWare components Netware.drv, Vnetware.386, and Vipx.386. Setup does not
copy the NetWare library files that Netware.drv looks for when it loads.

Additional query words: 3.11
