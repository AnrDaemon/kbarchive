TITLE   :PC DirSync: Err Msg: Warning 8 Error Deleting File...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the T2 phase of directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) (when SRVMAIN -r
runs), the following errors may be displayed:

   Error [115] Failure to read mail from <NULL>

   Warning[8] Error deleting file: Network/postoffice/$SYSTEM

   Server processing failure

NOTE: There may be several 115 errors, but only one Warning 8.

CAUSE
=====

SRVMAIN.EXE fails with the above error messages because of duplicate headers in
the SYSTEM.MBG file. During automatic directory synchronization, a failure code
is returned to NSDA, and the second phase of T2, which is SRVMAIN -t, is never
spawned.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.2 and 3.2a of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This problem was corrected in SRVMAIN.EXE
version 3.2.10. If you do not have version 3.2.10 (or later), You can find
SRVUPD.EXE, a self-extracting file, on the following services:

 - Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet

   On the www.microsoft.com home page, click the Support icon.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Version 3.2.10 SRVMAIN.EXE ignores the duplicate headers and will complete the
processing. The actual cause of duplicate headers in the SYSTEM.MBG is still
being investigated.
