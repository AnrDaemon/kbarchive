======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run an application, you may receive the following error
message:

   No network provider accepted the given network path.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur when you run a program with a universal naming
convention (UNC) name when you are not logged on to the network, or if you are
using the wrong frame type for the IPX protocol.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method:

 - Log on to the network using a valid user account. To do so, follow these
   steps:

   1. Save and close any open work on your computer.

   2. Click the Start button, then click Shut Down.

   3. In the Shut Down Windows dialog box, click the "Close all programs and log
      on as a different user" option button.

   4. Click the Yes button.

   5. When you are prompted, log on to the network with a valid user name and
      password.

 - Correct the Frame Type setting in the properties for the IPX protocol.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message stated above occurs only when you have multiple networks
installed. The generic error message occurs because Windows 95 does not know to
which network the connection request should go.
