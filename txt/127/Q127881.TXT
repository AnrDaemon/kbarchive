SUMMARY
=======

Your modem may fail to disconnect from a remote modem when you choose the Hang
Up button in Windows NT Remote Access (RASPHONE.EXE). RASPHONE acts as if the
connection is broken, however, your modem is still connected to the remote
modem. When you select the Hang Up button in RASPHONE, Remote Access Service
(RAS) drops Data Terminal Ready (DTR) to force the modem to disconnect from the
remote modem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If your modem is not disconnecting from the remote modem after you select the
Hang Up button in RASPHONE:

1. Check your modem cable if your are using an external modem.

    - Verify that your RS-232 modem cable includes a DTR pin.

    - Many 9-to-25 pin converters do not carry modem signals (including DTR).

    - Try using a different cable that you know is working correctly with RAS.

    - See the RAS help file (RASPHONE.HLP) for additional information on cable
      requirements for RAS.

2. Verify that RAS is setting your modem to use normal DTR operations. Most
   modems use the &D2 command to set the modem for normal DTR operations. To
   determine if normal DTR operations are being set properly for your modem,
   check the COMMAND_INIT string in it's corresponding section of the Windows NT
   MODEM.INF file. See the RAS help file for additional information on viewing
   and modifying the MODEM.INF file.

3. Confirm that your modem is not configured to ignore DTR. Some modems include
   a dip switch or jumper that allows you to configure the modem to ignore DTR.
   Check your modem documentation for information on how to configure your modem
   to use normal DTR operations or ignore DTR.

4. Add the following setting to the COMMAND_INIT string for your modem in the
   MODEM.INF file:

   S25=3.

   S25 controls the duration of time (in hundredths of a second) that DTR must be
   dropped before the modem disconnects itself from the remote modem. Setting
   this value to 3 will ensure that the modem disconnects almost immediately
   after choosing the Hang Up button in RASPHONE.
