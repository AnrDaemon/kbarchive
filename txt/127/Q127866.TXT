TITLE   :Cannot Change System Time In Access Using Time Statement
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to change the system time on a computer running Windows NT,
from within Microsoft Access 2.0 using the Time statement, the time does not get
changed; no error message appears.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

More Information
----------------

This is by design. You cannot change the system time from an MS-DOS/WOW tool,
although the time change is not lost. If you try to see the time in Access after
setting the time, you see the time changed to what you asked for, but it is not
reflected in the system.
