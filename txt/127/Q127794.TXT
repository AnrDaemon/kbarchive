The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SUMMARY
=======

If you are using the Microsoft client for NetWare networks and you are using a
login script to log on to the NetWare network, any terminate-and- stay-resident
(TSR) programs in the login script are not loaded.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design. You cannot load TSRs globally in the login script
because there is more than one virtual machine (VM) at this time.

Some TSRs require that you be logged on to the network before the TSR can be
loaded. Since you are not logged on to the network until Windows 95 starts,
these TSRs cannot be loaded when the AUTOEXEC.BAT file is processed. If you need
to use a TSR that must be loaded in the login script, you must use the Novell
NetWare client instead of the Microsoft client for NetWare networks. If a TSR
does not require that it be loaded in the login script then you can load it in
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file instead.
