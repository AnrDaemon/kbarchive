-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5

SYMPTOMS
========

After you update Windows NT version 3.5 to Service Pack 2, the Granularity value
for Sizing Grid changes when you choose Desktop in Control Panel, log off and
log back on, and choose Desktop in Control Panel again. The Granularity value in
Desktop of Control Panel increases in increments of 8. For example, if
Granularity is set to 1, it changes to 8 the next time you choose Desktop in
Control Panel after you log off and log back on (and from 8 to 64 even though
the maximum value for Granularity is 49).

CAUSE
=====

This problem only occurs if you choose Desktop in Control Panel after each
successive logon.

STATUS
======
