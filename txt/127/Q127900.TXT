SYMPTOMS
========

Using _declspec(dllexport) or _declspec(dllimport) on a class with multiple
static variable definitions may cause a C2487 error to be generated on all but
the first variable. For example, consider this class declaration:

   class _declspec(dllexport) MyClass
   {
   public:
   static int i,j,k;
   };

This class declaration generates these errors:

   error C2487: 'j' : member of dll interface class may not be declared with dll
   interface

   error C2487: 'k' : member of dll interface class may not be declared with dll
   interface

RESOLUTION
==========

Move each static variable declaration to its own line. To fix the above class so
that it will compile cleanly, use this:

   class _declspec(dllexport) MyClass
   {
   public:
     static int i;
     static int j;
     static int k;
   };

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
