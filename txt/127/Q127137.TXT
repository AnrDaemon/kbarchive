SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Disk Defragmenter tool in Windows 95, you receive the message
"Starting over, contents have changed" when the process is 50 percent complete.
Disk Defragmenter starts over each time it reaches 50 percent complete and the
process never finishes.

CAUSE
=====

Norton System Doctor, a utility from Symantec that continually monitors the free
space and fragmentation level on the hard disk, is running.

RESOLUTION
==========

Quit Norton System Doctor before you run Disk Defragmenter. Note that this
utility may be located in the Startup group so that it starts each time you
start your computer. If Norton System Doctor is in the Startup group, remember
to quit the utility each time you want to run Disk Defragmenter.
