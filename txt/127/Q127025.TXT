SUMMARY
=======

When you configure a computer running Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 as a
Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 client, you may need to add a -W
switch to USERTSR in the CLIENT.BAT file located at the MS\SMS\Bin directory.
However, Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 is not a supported client system for
SMS Server version 1.0.

The -W switch loads USERTSR for clients running Windows for Workgroups. When you
use the switch, USERTSR waits for the Remote Control Agent (WUSER.EXE) to start
before initializing itself on the network. Client Setup does not add this switch
because it handles Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 as if it were a LAN
Manager client.
