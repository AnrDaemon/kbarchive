The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following command line switches were not documented in the SourceSafe
version 3.0 Command Line Reference or the SourceSafe 3.1 Reference Manuals:

 - When you use the -O@<filename> switch, the at character (@) with the -O
   switch sends standard errors to the file as well as SourceSafe output

 - When you use the -o&<filename> switch, the ampersand character
   (&) with the -O switch suppresses the 'SourceSafe Output' window in the
   Windows and Windows NT Command Line executables.

 - When you use the -exitcode switch, SourceSafe outputs an exitcode.

Combining these switches allows for automated macros that do not require
intervention from the user. For example:

   SS GET $/build -r -o@&bldreslt.txt -exitcode
