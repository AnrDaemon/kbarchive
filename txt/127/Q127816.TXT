TITLE   :NWCONV Ignores Prefix for Duplicate Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Migration Tool for NetWare (NWCONV.EXE) in Windows NT Server
version 3.5 to convert user names and group names from a NetWare server, the
following error message appears in the LOGFILE.LOG file:

   ERROR: Saving Group Name

Error messages also appear in the LOGFILE.LOG file as follows:

   ERROR: Adding user <user name> to group <group name>

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when duplicate group names are detected in the Windows NT
Server during the conversion from the NetWare server, such as USERS. In order to
prevent this problem, you add a prefix for group name in the Migration Tool for
NetWare. However, the prefix is ignored during the conversion and the groups are
not migrated to the Windows NT Server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Create a new group at the NetWare server.

2. Move or add the user names from the duplicate group name to the new group
   name.

3. Run NWCONV.EXE again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

NetWare is manufactured by Novell, Inc., a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
