SUMMARY
=======

If a LOWRCASE.GLB file exists in the GLB directory, all files created by version
3.0.3 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation will be created
with lowercase filenames.

NOTE: The file LOWRCASE.GLB is not included with the product or with the
self-extracting file MACLIENT.HQX or MACLIENT.SEA, available on the Microsoft
Download Center.

Some network operating systems will not allow a file to be created in all
uppercase letters. Version 3.0.3 (or later) of the Macintosh client file has
been modified for these types of networks to allow the client to create
filenames in lowercase letters if LOWRCASE.GLB exists in the GLB subdirectory of
the Mail postoffice.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This file must be manually created, either by copying an existing file or
creating a new file with the name LOWRCASE.GLB in the GLB subdirectory of the
Mail for PC Networks postoffice.

To create the file LOWRCASE.GLB, change to the GLB subdirectory of the postoffice
and type:

   "copy populate.msm lowrcase.glb" (without the quotation marks)
