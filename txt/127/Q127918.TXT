TITLE   :PC Adm: Doc Err: Modifying Template Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2,3.2a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Page 328 of version 3.2 Microsoft Mail "Administrator's Guide" states the
following:

   If you are modifying only the template information, you can omit the line
   containing the modified address, as in this example:

   M George Jones
   - Title:/Sales Rep
   - Local:/3423
   - Department:/Sales

The above statement is in error. If you modify template information without the
complete address, it will cause the Import program (IMPORT.EXE) to display an
Error 72 when the (M)odify switch is used, and an Error 20 if the (T)emplate
switch is used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the Import program to modify template information, you must include
the complete address as shown below:

   M George Jones

   PCM:NETWORK/POSTOFFICE/GEORGEJ

   - Title:/Sales Rep
   - Local:/3423
   - Department:/Sales

The information on page 328 of the "Administrator's Guide" refers to a
specification for Mail that was never implemented.
