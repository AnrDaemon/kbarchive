TITLE   :Cannot Use Novell Network After Upgrading Compaq DOS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows 95 on a computer running Compaq DOS, you cannot log on
to the Novell network using EMSNETX.EXE as the network redirector.

CAUSE
=====

EMSNETX.EXE (Novell's EMS version of NETX.EXE) requires that an EMS provider be
loaded. Compaq DOS uses CEMM.EXE as the EMS provider. When you install Windows
95, Setup removes the following line from the CONFIG.SYS file, disabling the EMS
provider:

   DEVICE=<path>\CEMM.EXE RAM

RESOLUTION
==========

Adding the CEMM.EXE line back to the CONFIG.SYS file is not recommended.
CEMM.EXE may not work correctly in Windows 95. The preferred solution is to
install the Windows 95 client for NetWare networks. To do so, follow these
steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Network icon.

3. Click the Add button on the Configuration tab.

4. Click Client and then click the Add button.

5. In the Manufacturers box, click Microsoft. In the Network Clients box, click
   Client For NetWare Networks. Click the OK button.

6. Click the OK button, and then when you are prompted to, restart the computer.

You could also use NETX.EXE instead of EMSNETX.EXE.
