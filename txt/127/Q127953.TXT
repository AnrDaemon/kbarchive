PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows user sends a message to an existing
group, after the group has just been modified to contain newly created users,
mail may not be delivered to those new users. In addition, no error message will
be returned.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restart External to force the updated information to be stored memory, including
the new group definition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When mail addressed to a group is sent by Remote Mail for Windows, EXTERNAL.EXE
performs the group address resolution after it receives the mail. If the group
definition has been modified to include newly created users, and EXTERNAL.EXE
has not reached IntervalUpdate time, it will not know about these new users, and
new mail will not be created for them. If the group is made up of all new users,
mail will appear to have disappeared, and no error message will be generated.

EXTERNAL.EXE loads group information among other definitions into its memory at
start up. It also checks for updated information regularly based on the
IntervalUpdate setting. The default is set to 5 minutes.

For additional information, please see version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks "Administrator's Guide," page 248.
