TITLE   :Required Number of SQL Connections Needed for SMS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocerr kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smsdocerr

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Systems Management Server Administrator's Guide incorrectly
specifies the recommended number of SQL server connections needed for setting up
SMS on page 55:

   Make sure that the SQL Server has a maximum user connection
   setting that has at least 5 connections for use by SMS. Ten
   connections are recommended.

If you attempt to setup SMS version 1.0 with less than 20 connections, then the
following error appears during Setup:

   Not enough SQL connections are available for correct execution of SMS. At
   least 20 connections are recommended.

If you choose OK, the following error appears:

   Error: Number of requested connections must be >= 20.

RESOLUTION
==========

Increase the number of connections available to SQL to 20 or greater.

NOTE: Systems Management Server version 1.0 and 1.1 require SQL Server, not SQL
Workstation. SQL Server allows more than 20 connections, SQL Workstation allows
a maximum of 15.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
