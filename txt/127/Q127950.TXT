The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Hewlett-Packard (HP) DATA.EXE utility to initialize the DSP
modem on your HP Integrated Office Board, you receive the following error
message:

   Copyright (c) 1987-1993
   Analog Devices Inc., Digicom Systems Inc., Ring Zero Systems Inc.
   All Rights Reserved.
   You have an incompatible version of MS Windows or
   MS Windows is not running in Enhanced mode.

The modem does not function properly after you receive this error message.


CAUSE
=====

The HP DATA.EXE utility performs a version check that allows it to run only in
Windows version 3.1x. Because this version check fails in Windows 95, the modem
is not properly initialized and will not function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The HP Integrated Office Board is an adapter card that contains a sound card,
SCSI adapter, and modem. To use the modem, you must first run the DATA.EXE
utility to initialize the modem's DSP chip. The DATA.EXE utility is hard-coded
to check for Windows 3.1x and fails in Windows 95.

Note that the sound card and SCSI adapter do not require the DATA.EXE utility and
so will function in Windows 95.

The Hewlett-Packard Integrated Office Board is manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
