TITLE   :Mac Clients Must Log On to Trusted Domains - No Pass-through
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

From a Macintosh client, if you log into a Windows NT master domain and then
access a resource in a Windows NT domain that trusts the master domain, you must
re-enter your user ID and password.

This occurs even when Services for Macintosh is configured to use the Microsoft
User Authentication Module.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT clients are able to take advantage of Windows NT pass-through
validation, where when you have an account on the master domain, you can access
any trusting domain's resources without having to re-enter your name and
password. However, the design of the Macintosh redirector and the AppleTalk
protocol does not allow for participation in pass-through validation. Thus, you
must re-enter your user ID and password.

STATUS
======

This is a limitation of the Macintosh network client

The Macintosh computer and AppleTalk protocol are manufactured by Apple
Computers, Inc., a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied
or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or reliability.
