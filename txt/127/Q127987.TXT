The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the CapScrn tool (CAPSCRN.EXE) that is included with
Microsoft Video for Windows version 1.1 and the Video for Windows portion of
Microsoft Office Professional version 4.3c, you receive the following error
message:

   Unable to load the capture driver. The driver is either already in use, out
   of memory, or is not installed.

CAUSE
=====

When you start CapScrn, SCRNCAP.DRV (the capture device driver) is loaded into
memory. MSVIDEO.DLL, the file responsible for loading this device driver, has
changed from Windows version 3.1 and requires an entry in the SYSTEM.INI file to
load the driver into memory correctly in Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the
SYSTEM.INI file. Add the following line to the [Drivers] section of the file:

   MSVIDEO8=SCRNCAP.DRV

After you add this line, save and close the file and then restart your computer.
