Windows NT maintains a list of the ten most recently used (MRU) network
drives. To view this list in File Manager, choose Connect Network Drive
from the Disk menu. The drop-down Path menu lists the MRU connections.

To save 23 MRU connections, modify the Registry:

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree, go to the following key:

   \Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion \Network\Persistent Connections

3. Select Order.

4. From the Edit menu, choose String.

5. Change the entry to:

   abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw

   NOTE: This example assumes that you have only one fixed hard disk partition
   (drive C). If you have more than one drive, such as another hard disk
   partition or a CD-ROM drive, remove the corresponding number of letters. For
   example, if you also have drive D and a CD-ROM labeled E, change the entry to
   ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU.

6. Choose OK and quit the Registry Editor.
