TITLE   :Seed Routing Not Working With C.O.P.S. LocalTalk NIC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Services for the Macintosh on a computer running Windows NT Server
using an Ethernet or Token Ring network interface card (NIC) and a C.O.P.S.
LocalTalk NIC, Macintosh client computers can only view Windows NT Servers that
are using the same NIC as the default NIC for Services for Macintosh.

For example, if you select the C.O.P.S. LocalTalk NIC as the default NIC for
Services for Macintosh, only Macintosh client computers using the LocalTalk NIC
are able to view the Windows NT Server. Enabling seed routing has no effect.

CAUSE
=====

The LocalTalk Network Number is not sent out with the correct information in the
packet.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
