 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a Windows NT Server version 3.5 print queue that is attached
to a print queue on a NetWare server with a queue name that is greater than 12
characters, the NetWare server stops responding (hangs).

The print queue is attached as shown:

   Windows NT Server (print queue)
          |
           --> NetWare Server (print queue)
                    |
                     --> NFS on NetWare Server
                                  |
                                   --> UNIX Server
                                           |
                                            --> Printer

CAUSE

Windows NT does not truncate the name field in the client frame at 12
characters.
