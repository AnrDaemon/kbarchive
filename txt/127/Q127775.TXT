TITLE   :STOP 0x0A in STREAMS.SYS with DEC Pathworks Loaded
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT version 3.5 DEC Pathworks drivers, the following
STOP message may appear:

   STOP: 0x0000000A


CAUSE
-----

STREAMS.SYS does not behave correctly when the transport takes longer to complete
a connect request than the redirector allows. In this case, the redirector first
cancels the connect IRP, then later issues a disconnect. STREAMS.SYS erroneously
accepts the disconnect and crashes.

The disconnect should be rejected since the cancel issued a disconnect to the
transport.

STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
