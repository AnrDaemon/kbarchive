TITLE   :User Manager for Domains Does Not Set Correct Access
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run User manager on a computer running Windows NT and create a new user
account with the Profile Local Path specifying <DRIVE>%USERNAME% (where
<drive> is NTFS formatted), the directory that is created matches the
username and the permissions are set so that only the specified user can access
the directory.

When you run Windows NT Server Tools User Manager for Domains on a computer
running Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups and create a new user account with
the Profile Local Path specifying <DRIVE>%USERNAME% (where <drive>
is NTFS formatted), the directory that is created has the permissions set so
that everyone has access to the user's directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server Tools. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create new users from a computer running Windows NT
Workstation or Server in the domain.

You can still use Windows NT Server Tools to administer existing users.
