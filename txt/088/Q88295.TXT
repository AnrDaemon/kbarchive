TITLE   :PRB: Clicking Database Runs Run-Time, Not Development Version

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Clicking a program or database created in FoxBASE+ for the Macintosh
(FoxBASE+/Mac) activates FoxBASE+/Mac. However, when the FoxBASE+/Mac run-time
version is installed on the system, clicking a program or database activates the
run-time version.

CAUSE
=====

When you click a secondary file, the Macintosh Finder uses the file's creator
type to determine which file to execute. Because the FoxBASE+/Mac development
environment and the FoxBASE+/Mac run-time environment have the same creator
type, the Finder activates the first of these packages that it finds.

Additional query words: 2.01
