OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changing the default printer driver for version 3.1 of Microsoft Windows does
not change the printer driver for version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for Windows. To update Mail, choose Print from the File menu, select the Setup
button, then choose the OK button.

CAUSE
=====

Changing or replacing the default printer using Windows Control Panel or Print
Manager updates entries in the WIN.INI file. Mail stores its default printer
designation as "Printer=" in the [Microsoft Mail] section of the MSMAIL.INI
file. Mail assumes that the default printer remains the same unless you specify
otherwise through the Windows client. To reset the Windows client, Mail must
read the WIN.INI file and find out which printer is now the default.

WORKAROUND
==========

To reset the default printer in the Windows client, you can:

 - Choose Print from the File menu and select the Setup button, then choose the
   OK button.

-or-

 - Choose Print from the File menu and select the Setup button, then select the
   new default printer and choose OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail for Windows
versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
