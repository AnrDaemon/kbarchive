SUMMARY
=======

Changing the stance in Advanced Shot Setup doesn't affect a ball's flight when
it's hit. In real golf, you adjust your stance to change your swing plane and
club face. Because you have explicit control over these in Golf, there is no
need to change stance. We allow stance to be changed to allow people to mimic
their own styles and because it looks more accurate to have the stance set along
with the swing plane/club face.
