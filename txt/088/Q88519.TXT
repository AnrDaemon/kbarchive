TITLE   :Running Golf with a 256-Color Video Driver Is Faster

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Golf for Windows is optimized to run on a 256-color video card and
driver. As a result, when you run Golf with a 16-color video driver, total
performance will be slower because Golf has to dither the colors that make up
the main and top view. For better performance, upgrade your video card and
driver to support 256 colors.
