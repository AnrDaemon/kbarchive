======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Pressing the TAB key at the beginning of a paragraph causes unexpected behavior.
For example, the cursor does not move to a tab stop or you receive a system
beep.

CAUSE
=====

In PowerPoint, pressing TAB has a special outlining function. It moves the
paragraph to the next indentation level. Following are examples of what
PowerPoint does when you press TAB.

 - When you press the TAB key, the cursor moves to the first line indent for the
   next indentation level rather than to the next default or custom tab stop.

 - When you press TAB at the beginning of a paragraph you hear a system beep.
   This occurs when you reach the fifth indent level, which is the maximum
   indent level supported by PowerPoint.

 - When you press TAB at the beginning of a title, you hear a system beep. This
   occurs because you cannot outline a title object in PowerPoint.

RESOLUTION
==========

To insert a tab character at the beginning of a paragraph, press "CTRL+TAB"
(without the quotation marks) or "OPTION+TAB" (without the quotation marks).
