SUMMARY
=======

According to Microtek Technical Support, when printing large files (over 20
pages) from Microsoft Windows version 3.1 to the TrueLaser PostScript printer
model MTP-306, you may receive the following error message on the printout:

   Offending Command

To correct this problem, Microtek suggests adding the following line to the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   Mode LPT1:,,P

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setting Windows' Transmission Retry to 999 does not correct this problem.

The MODE command shown above is a retry setting to indicate how a print job
should be handled when a printer does not accept information.

The two commas are placeholders for the first two parameters (characters-per-line
and line-per-inch), which will not change. Information is then sent to the
printer until the printer returns a completion code or an error code to MS-DOS,
or until you press CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK to stop printing.

This MODE command is documented on page 256 of the Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0
"User's Guide and Reference."

NOTE: an alternative troubleshooting method would be to turn off the Windows
Print Manager.
