SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Word for Windows generates the following error message when you start
Word if the Word and Bookshelf CD is not in the CD-ROM drive:

   Word cannot use the Tools-Path specified in the WIN.INI file because it is
   invalid.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent the error message from reoccurring, make sure that the proper CD is
in the CD-ROM drive prior to starting Word for Windows. The Tools-Path= section
sets alternative locations for proofing tools, file converters, graphic filters,
autosave files, and user dictionaries.

This error will also occur if the CD-ROM drive cannot detect a new CD-ROM disk in
the drive (for example, the Bookshelf 1993 Upgrade Setup). To correct this
problem, Run File Manager and access the CD-ROM drive before starting Word.
