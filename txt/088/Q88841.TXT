======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose the Printers icon from the Windows 3.1 Control Panel, and then
choose the Setup button, Windows may display the following message:

   An old version of UNIDRV.DLL is installed on your system. Your printer
   requires a newer version. Install the updated UNIDRV.DLL file into your
   Windows SYSTEM directory.

When you choose OK to dismiss the message, Windows displays the following:

   Control Panel

   Not enough memory available for this task. Quit one or more applications to
   increase available memory, and then try again.

NOTE: This second message does not accurately describe the problem; ignore this
message.

CAUSE
=====

As the first error message indicates, this problem occurs when a printer driver
does not match the version of UNIDRV.DLL currently installed. This typically
occurs when you attempt to manually copy an updated printer driver file into the
Windows SYSTEM or Windows directory, without actually updating the UNIDRV.DLL
and driver file through Control Panel.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem:

1. Reinstall the printer driver through Control Panel:

   a. Choose the Printers icon, and choose the Add button.

   b. Select Install Unlisted Or Updated Printer, then choose the Install
      button.

   c. Type the directory path to the OEMSETUP.INF file for the printer driver
      and UNIDRV.DLL combination. (This will install the printer driver as well
      as its associated UNIDRV.DLL.

   - or -

2. Copy the UNIDRV.DLL and UNIDRV.HLP files, which came with the updated printer
   driver, into your WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

3. If UNIDRV.DLL exists in the C:\WINDOWS directory, remove it. UNIDRV.DLL
   should reside in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
