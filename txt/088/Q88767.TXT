PagePrinter Emulation and History
---------------------------------

The IBM Personal PagePrinter 4216-31 replaces the IBM 4216-30. It supports the
following emulation:

 - PostScript

 - IBM Proprinter XL

 - Hewlett-Packard LaserJet Plus

 - Diablo 630

The standard configuration is 2 MB of RAM and one of the following interfaces:
RS/232, Centronics Parallel, or AppleTalk. It uses its own MS-DOS level drivers
in the CONFIG.SYS and/or AUTOEXEC.BAT files, which are needed for the printer to
function within Windows. Normally, Windows prints to the port called EPT.

The EPT port cannot be redirected like LPTx ports can. For example, you can use
LPT1.OS2, but you cannot use EPT.OS2.

If you own a 4216-30, then you can order an upgrade kit directly from IBM. This
makes the 3216-30 a 4216-31, with the exception of sheet feeder support.

The printer also supports a dual-bin sheet feeder.

PagePrinter Current Drivers
---------------------------

The IBM drivers need to be version 2.0 or later. There is a README.TXT file that
comes on the driver's disks that documents the installation procedure.
