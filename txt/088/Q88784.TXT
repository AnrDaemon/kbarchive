LaserMaster Controller Card Overview
------------------------------------

LaserMaster makes a printer controller card series that allows non-PostScript
printers to print PostScript faster and with greater quality than normally
obtainable from a PostScript printer cartridge.

Windows 3.0 LaserMaster UAE Error Messages
------------------------------------------

When printing from version 3.0 of Excel for Windows, Aldus PageMaker version 4.0,
and Micrografx Designer version 3.02, UAEs are generated if a driver earlier
than version 3.56 is used.

Windows 3.0 Unable to Run in Any Mode
-------------------------------------

If you are using the LaserMaster card and version 3.2 of the LaserMaster printer
driver, Windows cannot run in any mode, if the printer is turned off.

To correct this problem, turn on the printer. Version 3.58 of this driver from
LaserMaster corrects this problem.

LMDPS: DDPI Load Failure (LaserMaster 1000)
-------------------------------------------

When installing the LaserMaster 1000 printer driver in Windows 3.0, you may get
the error message:

   LMDPS : DDPI Load Failure

This is caused by a faulty installation of the printer driver. Contact
LaserMaster for instructions on how to install LaserMaster drivers correctly.

Windows 3.1 TrueType and LaserMaster
------------------------------------

LaserMaster technical support has confirmed that LaserMaster's current printer
and video drivers for the GS-1280 do not work with Windows 3.1's TrueType
fonts.

LaserMaster suggests the following as a workaround for using printer and video
drivers version 3.58 and 3.58b with Windows 3.1:

1. Install Windows 3.1 with the standard VGA driver included.

2. Run Control Panel and choose the Fonts icon.

3. Choose the TrueType button.

4. Clear the Enable TrueType Fonts check box.

5. Reinstall the Laser Master drivers.

The printer driver can be identified as LMLX6.DRV; the video driver is LMDPS.DRV.
Both files for version 3.58 have a date of 7/22/91; 3.58b is dated 11/22/91.
LaserMaster will be releasing a version of the drivers compatible with
TrueType.

The LaserMaster, Micrografx, and PageMaker products included here are
manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied
or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
