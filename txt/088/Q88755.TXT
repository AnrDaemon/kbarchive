-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0a, 5.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Windows 3.1 screen savers do not work while running Microsoft
Excel with the AutoSave option enabled. AutoSave is a macro that comes with
Excel that can be loaded as an add-in macro designed to automatically save
documents at preset times.

NOTE: This information may also apply to other applications that have AutoSave
functionality or clock or timer functionality.

For example, the hDC Alarm Clock that comes with hDC First Apps version 1.0 for
Windows also stops the Windows screen savers from operating correctly if the
Always Visible option is selected under the Preferences Menu of the hDC Alarm
Clock's control menu.

CAUSE
=====

The Excel AutoSave feature prevents the Windows 3.1 screen savers from
functioning when Excel is maximized or is the active Window. If Excel is running
in an inactive window, AutoSave does not interfere with the screen saver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if AutoSave is enabled in Excel, do the following:

1. Run Excel.

2. Open the Options menu. If the AutoSave command appears and is chosen, then it
   is enabled. If AutoSave does not appear in the menu, or it appears and is not
   selected, it is disabled.

To disable the Autosave feature in Excel:

1. From the Options menu, choose AutoSave.

2. Under Save Frequency, select Never, then choose the OK button.
