SUMMARY
=======

The CBitmap class provided by Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), does not
contain member functions that return the width and height of a bitmap.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The width and height of a CBitmap may be obtained by using the member function
GetObject(). GetObject() can return a BITMAP structure that contains both the
height and the width of the bitmap, along with some additional information.

The sample code below illustrates two functions that accept a CBitmap reference
and return the width and height contained in the BITMAP structure returned by
GetObject().

Sample Code
-----------

      int GetCBitmapWidth(const CBitmap & cbm)
      {
         BITMAP bm;
         cbm.GetObject(sizeof(BITMAP),&bm);
         return bm.bmWidth;
      }

      int GetCBitmapHeight(const CBitmap & cbm)
      {
         BITMAP bm;
         cbm.GetObject(sizeof(BITMAP),&bm);
         return bm.bmHeight;
      }
