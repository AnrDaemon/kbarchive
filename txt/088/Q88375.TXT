SUMMARY
=======

When you print from Microsoft Windows using serial communications (COM) ports,
Windows does not detect error conditions on the printer. The communication
process is one way.

Steps to Test a Serial Plotter Connection
-----------------------------------------

To test whether a plotter is properly connected to a computer running Microsoft
Windows, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

   echo sp1 ;pd 1000,1000 ;pu > comX:

In the above command, "x" is the number of the serial port being used (for
example, COM1).

This test will activate the plotter, select pen 1, and draw a line down the
length of the page.

If this test does not work correctly, contact your dealer or hardware
manufacturer for assistance. The following is a list of possible problems that
will cause the plotter to not function properly:

 - Incorrect switch settings on plotter

 - Incorrect MS-DOS-mode settings

 - Interrupt conflict with another hardware device

 - Bad printer cable

 - Bad serial connection
