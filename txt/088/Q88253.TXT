SUMMARY
=======

If you have two or more Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet III series printer drivers
installed and configured for different ports, printer setting changes for one
printer affect all other HP III printers installed. There is no workaround for
this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, by editing the WIN.INI file, you can create two additional ports by
adding the following lines to the [ports] section of the WIN.INI file:

   LPT1.LOW=
   LPT1.UPP=

You can install a printer driver and configure it to print from the lower tray to
the port LPT1.LOW. You can install the same printer driver again and configure
it to print from the upper tray to the port LPT1.UPP. Now, instead of having to
change the printer driver configuration when you want to print from a different
paper source, you can select a different printer driver.

This works correctly for most printer drivers, but does not work for the HP
LaserJet III. If you attempt to do this with an HP LaserJet III, the printer
driver settings for one port are duplicated for the second port. Again using the
above example, if you configured the HP III on LPT1.UPP for the upper paper
tray, the same printer settings are saved for the HP III for LPT1.LOW.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in HP LaserJet III driver version
31.3.89. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as
it becomes available.
