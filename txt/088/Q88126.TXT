TITLE   :BUG: HC Error 2050 from #include in Help Project File (.HPJ)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are building a Help file with the Microsoft Windows Help Compiler, the
process stops with the following error message:

   Error 2050: line <number> of <filename>.HPJ : Invalid #include
   syntax

CAUSE
=====

The Help project (.HPJ) file contains a #include statement where the filename is
delimited by quotation marks ("") rather than angle brackets (<>).

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, modify the .HPJ file to delimit the filename in the
#include statement with angle brackets. For example, replace the following
statement

      #include "map.h"

with the following:

      #include <map.h>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the Windows Help Compiler
version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
