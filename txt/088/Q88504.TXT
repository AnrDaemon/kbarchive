The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you select text in the Windows Terminal program, the Highlight
and HighlightText colors defined in the WIN.INI's [colors] section are
not used. Instead Terminal inverts the existing colors.

For example, if the Terminal screen is white with black text, then the
selected (highlighted) text is white on a black background.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.00a 3.00 3.11
