KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Path statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file does not contain the Windows
directory and drive letter, you may receive the following error message if you
install TrueType fonts from a logical drive other than the one containing
Windows.

   Unable to Create File:

   Unable to install the <Font Name> font. The font file may be damaged.
   Check with your font vendor about obtaining a new file.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur under the following conditions:

 - The Path statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file does not contain the Windows
   directory and driver letter.

   -or-

 - Your CONTROL.EXE file is corrupt.

WORKAROUND
==========

Check the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to be sure that your Windows directory and drive
letter are in the Path statement. If they are missing, add them.

If the Path statement is okay, your CONTROL.EXE file may be corrupt. Use the
EXPAND utility to copy this file from the original Windows disks to your Windows
directory. From the MS-DOS prompt, enter a command similar to the following

   expand <a>:control.ex_ <c>:\<windows>\control.exe

where <a>: is your floppy drive letter, <c> is your hard drive
letter, and <windows> is your Windows directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you attempt to install TrueType fonts from the same logical drive and the
drive letter for the WINDOWS directory is not included, then the FOT and TTF
files are be placed in the WINDOWS directory instead of the SYSTEM
subdirectory.
