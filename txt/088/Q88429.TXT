SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a Swan products video driver or adapter, you may experience the
following problems when you run Microsoft Windows version 3.1:

 - Swan Products Super VGA card (SVGA-16) comes with a Windows high- resolution
   video drivers dated 01/21/91. Some of these drivers work correctly in
   standard mode, but do not allow Windows to run in 386 enhanced mode.

 - EANSI.SYS version 6.0, which comes with the Swan Products video adapter
   Palette Plus, causes Windows 3.1 to stop responding (hang) when you run a
   Windows-based application in standard or 386 enhanced mode.

CAUSE
=====

Swan Products' video drivers and the EANSI.SYS utility need to be updated to
function properly with Microsoft Windows version 3.1.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct these problems, obtain a new video adapter driver (UPDATE31.ZIP) from
Swan technical support, or remove EANSI.SYS from the CONFIG.SYS file.

The Swan products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
