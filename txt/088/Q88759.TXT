SUMMARY
=======

According to National Semiconductor, Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a are
compatible with the Quadram EGA Prosync that has an EPROM and four switches. If
you have the video card with six switches, you need to upgrade the EPROM.

The Windows EGA.SYS file is not compatible with this card and should not be
loaded. The symptoms of EGA.SYS being loaded include screen distortion when the
mouse is moved and a possible system hang when switching to MS-DOS-based
applications.

This card only supports CGA. Windows 3.1 does not ship with CGA drivers, and has
only limited support for CGA. Windows 3.0 shipped with CGA drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An earlier EPROM may cause Windows to experience problems shelling out to the
MS-DOS command prompt. When this occurs, the error message "386 display type
mismatch" is displayed.
