The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article documents the correct settings for Terminal to properly communicate
with the following online services:

 - CompuServe

 - BIX

 - GEnie

 - TymNet

 - Most bulletin board services (BBSs)

MORE INFORMATION
================

CompuServe
----------

To log on to CompuServe, do the following:

1. From the Settings menu, choose Terminal Emulation.

2. Choose DEC VT-100 (ANSI) and choose OK.

3. From the Settings menu, choose Communications.

4. Choose 7 Data Bits, Even Parity, and 1 Stop Bit. Choose OK.

NOTE: CompuServe defaults to 7 data bits, which is not compatible with XModem
file transfers. For this reason, you cannot use Terminal's XModem protocol to
transfer files with CompuServe set at 7 data bits. After you set CompuServe to
use 8 data bits, you can set up Terminal to use 8 data bits and no parity. With
this setting, you can use XModem to transfer files with CompuServe. For
information on how to set up CompuServe to use 8 data bits, contact CompuServe
support (type go help at the CompuServe prompt).

BIX ("BYTE" Magazine's Online Information eXchange Service)
-----------------------------------------------------------

To log on to BIX, do the following:

1. From the Settings menu, choose Terminal Emulation.

2. Choose DEC VT-100 (ANSI) and choose OK.

3. From the Settings menu, choose Communications.

4. Choose 7 Data Bits, Even Parity, and 1 Stop Bit. Choose OK.

   Preferences menu), and choose OK.

------

TymNet is a modem dial-in that provides access to Bank of America's Home Banking

If connection is established and text is not readable, use step 1 below to clear
bad characters. If step 1 is not successful, use step 2.

   a capital letter "A" (without the quotation marks).

these settings when first opened.
