The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Seagate ST-01 and ST-02 SCSI host adapters can be configured to work with
Microsoft Windows; however, you need to resolve the following two issues to
allow these cards to function correctly:

 - Excluding ST-01 and ST-02 in the upper memory area (UMA)

 - Using ST-02 with an RLL controller

MORE INFORMATION
================

Excluding ST-01 and ST-02 in UMA
--------------------------------

The Seagate model ST-01 and ST-02 SCSI host adapters use a memory address space
in the upper memory area (UMA) between 640 and 1024K. This address used is
defined by the JP-1 jumper on the card.

After determining the card's address, exclude it in the SYSTEM.INI file with an
EMMEXCLUDE=xxxx-yyyy in the [386Enh] section, or exclude it with your UMA
provider, such as EMM386.EXE, if you are using one.

No pins
connected         EMMEXCLUDE=C800-CBFF     X=C800-CBFF

Pins C&D
connected         EMMEXCLUDE=CC00-CFFF     X=CC00-CFFF

Pins A&B and
C&D connected     EMMEXCLUDE=DC00-DFFF     X=DC00-DFFF

Using ST-02 With an RLL Controller
----------------------------------

If you are using a Seagate ST-02 SCSI controller and a RLL controller in the same
machine, then make sure the RLL is the primary controller or you can't use the
ST-02 to control your floppy drives.

To make the RLL controller the primary controller, make sure that you change its
ROM address in the UMA to be lower than the SCSI controller's address. For
example, if the RLL controller is at D400, and the ST-02 is at D000, move the
RLL controller to C800.

This may require changing the SCSI controller address also. Check the hardware
manuals for this information.
