TITLE   :Micrografx Designer 3.1 Fails to Release GDI Resources
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Micrografx Designer 3.1 may fail to release GDI resources during zooms and text
editing. These problems are aggravated if you use a high-resolution display
(1024 x 768), and you may experience slow response and the application may stop
responding (hang). These problems can also occur when you paste Micrografx
images into other applications.

RESOLUTION
==========

Micrografx has a patch called GDIFIX.EXE that resolves this problem. You can
download the patch from the Micrografx bulletin board service (BBS). Contact
Micrografx for more information.

If you need an immediate workaround, add the following lines to the [Micrografx
Fonts] section of WIN.INI. You may see some slowing during redraws; however,
Designer will release GDI resources.

      [Micrografx Fonts]
      MGXFNT=C:\WINDOWS\MGXLIBS\MGXFONTS,MGXFNT,MGXFNT.FTM,0,0
      FONT CACHE = 5
      BITMAP CACHE = 2000
      CHARACTER CACHE = 2048

Values                   Definitions
---------------------------------------------------------

Font Cache value:        3 through 30; default is 25.
Bitmap Cache value:      100 through 8192; default is 8192.
Character Cache value:   1024 through 16384; default is 16384.
