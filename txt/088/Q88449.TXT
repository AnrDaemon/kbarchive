SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Golf for Windows version 1.0, the distance in the Total field and
the distance in the To Pin field in the Post Shot dialog do not add up to the
original distance to pin from tee. The error on these figures is from 3 to 6
yards. The expected error due to rounding should be only 1 yard. Unless you hit
the ball straight at the pin, the numbers will not add up.

Additional query words: 1.00
