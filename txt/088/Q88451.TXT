SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Golf for Windows version 1.0, the Aiming Marker Pole hangs up at
different locations in the Main View window when you move it around with the
mouse. The problem is more pronounced when the Aim Shot command is chosen from
the Action menu with the keyboard. This is caused when the Aiming Marker pole
gets into a ravine or other steep slope on the fairway. Try moving the Aiming
Marker left or right to get around this obstacle.
