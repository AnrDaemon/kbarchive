SUMMARY
=======

If you exit from Paintbrush (PBRUSH.EXE) and choose not to save changes,
Paintbrush may remain active if earlier versions of OLECLI.DLL and OLESVR.DLL
are in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

If the file dates of OLECLI.DLL and OLESVR.DLL are earlier than 3/10/92, they
should be replaced with the files from the Windows 3.1 disks. On the 5.25-inch
disk set, OLECLI.DLL is on disk 4, and OLESVR.DLL is on disk 5. On 3.5-inch
disks, OLECLI.DLL is on disk 5 and OLESVR.DLL is on disk 4.

Use the following commands to expand the two files off the Windows disks:

OLECLI.DLL
----------

   expand (x):olecli.dl_ c:\windows\system\olecli.dll

OLESVR.DLL
----------

   expand (x):olesvr.dl_ c:\windows\system\olesvr.dll

MORE INFORMATION
================

OLECLI.DLL is the OLE client dynamic-link library (DLL) for Windows, and
OLESVR.DLL is the OLE server dynamic-link library for Windows. Windows uses
these files to carry out OLE functions.
