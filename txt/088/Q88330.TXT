SUMMARY
=======

You may receive an Unrecoverable Application Error (UAE) when using hDC's
Express program with Microsoft Windows. This error occurs when you use the
Express program as the Windows shell and when the Auto-Maximize feature in hDC
Express is turned on.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default setting in the Express Preferences is for Windows Express to
maximize automatically. This maximizing action may causes UAEs when hDC is used
as the default Windows shell. To alleviate this problem, use one of the
following workarounds.

Workaround 1
------------

Turn off the auto-maximize feature in Windows Express:

1. From the Express window menu, choose Special Preferences.

2. Clear the Maximize Automatically check box.

3. Choose the Permanent button.

   -or-

Workaround 2
------------

Do not load Windows Express as the shell, instead load it from the "run=" line of
the WIN.INI file:

1. Edit the WIN.INI file with a text editor such and Notepad.

2. The shell= line in the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file will read:

         shell=<path>express.exe

   Add the <path>express.exe portion of that line to the run= line in the
   [boot] section.

3. Change the shell=<path>express.exe line to:

         shell=progman.exe

4. Exit and restart Windows.
