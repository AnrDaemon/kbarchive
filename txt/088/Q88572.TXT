SUMMARY
=======

According to Intel technical support, the Intel Inboard 386/PC does not run
Microsoft Windows version 3.1. The Inboard 386/PC was designed for IBM XT class
machines based on the 8088 or 8086 processors.

There is no workaround to this problem.

There is an entry in the Windows 3.1 Compatibility List for the IBM AT/Inboard
386 AT. This is a different product that upgrades the IBM AT (80286 processor)
to a 80386 computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Intel has released a version of Windows 3.0 that works on an XT system with the
Intel Inboard 386/PC. The Intel version of Windows runs in real and standard
modes.

The Intel version of Windows is available from Intel, from retail outlets, and
from mail-order companies.

The Intel disk cache software, ICACHE, should not be used with Windows 3.0 or
3.1.

The Intel products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft. We make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
