SUMMARY

The INKEY(0) function determines the corresponding CHR() value for a key press.
When the INKEY(0) function returns a negative value, a function key was pressed.
Use care when passing the value from INKEY(0) to the CHR() function.

The character trapped by INKEY(0) is not echoed to the console when a key is
pressed.

Format
------

<expN>=INKEY(0)

Example
-------

   . ? INKEY(0) && Get the next key press and print ASCII value -3
   && The F4 function key was pressed (ASCII - 76)
