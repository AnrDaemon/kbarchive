======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft WinLogin, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Microsoft WinLogin version 1.0, you may receive the following error
message:

   Could not connect to the remote resource

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the WinLogin Client software cannot communicate with the
server where the WinLogin database resides.

This error may occur when starting Windows using WinLogin if you save changes
with WinLogin or if you exit Windows on a workstation using WinLogin.

The following situations may create the error:

 - The server where the WinLogin database resides is no longer active on the
   network (that is, it has been taken offline).

 - The server has an "auto-disconnect" feature that disconnects inactive users
   from shared directories after a specified period of time.

 - There are other network problems that are preventing the WinLogin Client
   software from communicating with the server where the WinLogin database
   resides.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Restore the WinLogin server to an active state.

 - Disable the Auto-Disconnect feature on the WinLogin server.
