SYMPTOMS
========

You have a Complete PC Scanner and Complete PC Communicator modem sharing one
communications (COM) port. When you switch from the scanner to the modem and
back again in Microsoft Windows 3.1 enhanced mode, the COM port isn't released.

NOTE: The Complete PC Scanner can be plugged into the back of the Complete PC
Communicator; allowing the modem and scanner to share one COM port.

RESOLUTION
==========

Complete PC released the following a version of the scanner driver for its
scanner to work correctly in 386 enhanced mode of Windows 3.1.

   Filename:       CPCSCAN2.SYS
   File Date:      5/27/92
   File Size:      10244 bytes
   Version Number: 2.1

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to Complete PC Technical Support, you can install the new driver as
follows:

1. Download the new file.

2. Exit Windows.

3. Rename the new file to CPCSCAN.SYS.

4. Replace the old driver with the new one by copying it into the Windows\SYSTEM
   subdirectory.

5. Restart Windows.

If this does not correct the problem, Complete PC technical support suggests you
reinstall the Complete PC Scanner using the separate interface card that comes
with the scanner, and set it for a separate COM port.
