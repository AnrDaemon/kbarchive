SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Setup Toolkit for Windows does not provide any options or
functions for maximizing the frame window. The frame window will always be
initially displayed as an unmaximized window with a caption.

However, you can call the Windows ShowWindow and SetWindowLong application
programming interface (API) functions from a script to maximize the frame and
remove the caption. If the calls are made at the beginning of the script, there
will be only a quick flicker as the window size and border are changed. The
following code can be used to do this:

   ''following were taken from windows.h. &H means they're hex
   CONST WS_VISIBLE=&H10000000
   CONST WS_BORDER =&H00800000
   CONST WS_CLIPCHILDREN =&H02000000
   CONST GWL_STYLE =-16
   CONST SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED=3

   DECLARE FUNCTION ShowWindow  LIB "user.exe" (hWnd%,iShow%) AS INTEGER
   DECLARE FUNCTION SetWindowLong LIB "user.exe" (hWnd%, offset%, style&)
                   AS LONG     ''this declaration must all be on one line

   .
   .
   .
   hWnd%=HwndFrame()
   i1&=SetWindowLong(hWnd%,GWL_STYLE,WS_VISIBLE+WS_BORDER+WS_CLIPCHILDREN)
   j1%=ShowWindow(hWnd%,SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED)
   .
   .
   .
