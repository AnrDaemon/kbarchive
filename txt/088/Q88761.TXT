-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Hewlett-Packard HP-HIL mouse may stop in Windows 3.0 and 3.1 for one
of two possible reasons:

 - The HP-HIL mouse may connect to the computer keyboard on some Hewlett-Packard
   (HP) Vectra machines and will not move while disk I/O is taking place. This
   is a hardware limitation of this mouse model and is not a Windows problem.
   The problem may be less evident outside of Windows because normal MS-DOS is
   not a multitasking environment.

 - Using an older Hewlett-Packard (HP) MS-DOS mouse driver (MOUSE.COM or
   MOUSE.SYS) with Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1 can cause the HP-HIL Mouse to
   freeze when switching between MS-DOS-based applications.

   The Microsoft MS-DOS mouse drivers will NOT recognize the HP HIL Mouse. The HP
   mouse driver must be used. Use the MOUSEHP.CO_ and MOUSEHP.SY_ from the
   Windows disks, and use the EXPAND utility to expand them into MOUSEHP.SYS and
   MOUSEHP.COM.
