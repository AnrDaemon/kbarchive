SUMMARY
=======

You may want to create a running calculation in a report that will update after
each grouping and total the result.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, suppose your database is called TEST.DBF. In this database are
fields called QTY and ITEMNO. For this example, you want to group on ITEMNO and
track the totals in QTY for each item number. You then want to track the totals
in QTY as a running calculation within each group and display a grand total at
the end of the report. Do the following:

1. Create your grouping on ITEMNO.

2. Choose Report from the menu bar, then select Memory Variable. Choose Add and
   create a variable X that will be reset at the end of the group ITEMNO. X is
   the expression SUM(QTY) and has an initial value of 0.

3. Choose Add again and create a second variable called Y. Y also has an initial
   value of 0 and is the expression X+Y. Y is reset at the end of the report.

4. Place the cursor in the report group footer. Choose Report from the menu bar
   to place the calculations in your report. Select Field from the list.

5. Choose X as the value of the group's calculation and choose Y as the field
   for your running calculation.

Each time the group changes, the sum of QTY will be contained in the variable X
and Y will add that value to its own value. Because Y is reset only at the end
of the report, Y will keep a running calculation of each time the value of X
changes.
