SUMMARY
=======

When the Hewlett-Packard (HP) ProCollection cartridge is selected on the HP
LaserJet Series II printer driver in Microsoft Windows, the font options for
Helv and TMSRMN (Times Roman) in bold and italic at 8-point size are displayed
as available. The ProCollection cartridge does not support these fonts at this
size. This information applies to version 1.1 of the driver.

MORE INFORMATION

According to HP Technical Support, the ProCollection cartridge cannot produce
the Helv or Times Roman fonts in bold or italic at 8-point size. Even though the
italic and bold selections are available when choosing these fonts at the
8-point size, they will be displayed and printed as the normal style, not bold
or italic.

The Helv and Times Roman fonts from the ProCollection cartridge are available in
the following styles and sizes:
