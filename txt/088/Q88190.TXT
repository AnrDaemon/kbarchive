SYMPTOMS
========

When you are trying to install a system hook function with SetWindowsHookEx in a
Dynamic-Link Library (DLL), the hook function is executed only within the
calling application even though it is supposed to affect all applications
system-wide.

CAUSE
=====

In Windows 3.0, the minimum required compile option to generate the appropriate
entry/exit code sequence for a Windows-based application is the /Gw switch.

With Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0, however, the documentation states that the /Gw
and /GW switches should be used only for applications that must run in real mode
Windows. Because real mode is no longer available in Windows 3.1, most programs
should now be built using the /GA switch (/GD for DLLs). The C 7.0 /GA and /GD
switches require that exported functions (especially callback functions) be
explicitly marked as __export if the switch is to affect them.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the DLL containing the hook function is compiled with the /GD switch, the
hook function should be explicitly marked with the __export keyword:

      LRESULT FAR PASCAL __export CbtFunc (int Code,

                                        WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
