SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines the required configuration for using the Quantum Hardcard
XL with Microsoft Windows 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use a Hardcard XL with Windows 3.1, Quantum (formerly Plus Development)
recommends the following:

 - In the CONFIG.SYS file, load all memory managers before loading Quantum's
   ATDOSXL.SYS device driver. For example:

         device=c:\windows\himem.sys
         device=c:\windows\emm386.exe
         device=c:\atdosxl.sys

 - Exclude the Hardcard XL's BIOS address range (the default is C800-C9FF),
   using either a memory manager (EMM386.EXE) or the EMMEXCLUDE= statement in
   the SYSTEM.INI file.

 - Use version 1.7 of Quantum's ATDOSXL.SYS device driver. This device driver
   can be downloaded from Quantum's bulletin board service (BBS). The device
   driver is in a self-extracting file called HCIIXL.EXE.
