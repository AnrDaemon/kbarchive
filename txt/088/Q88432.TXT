SUMMARY
=======

The following STB (Simply The Best) video cards run with Microsoft Windows:

Card                   Notes
----                   -----

Powergraph VGA         Has a driver to support 1024 x 768 with 256
                       colors; this card needs at least 1 MB of
                       memory to support this video mode

Auto VGA               Uses a Microsoft driver for standard VGA

VGA Extra Em           Uses a Microsoft driver for standard VGA

VGA EM-16              Uses a Microsoft driver for standard VGA; only
                       runs in standard mode unless BIOS is 1.33
                       or greater

640 VGA and VGA 80/16  May require a BIOS upgrade from STB if the
                       BIOS version is 1.78 or earlier

If you use these cards while running in 386 enhanced mode of Windows operating
system version 3.1, and you are experiencing erratic mouse behavior after
exiting from the MS-DOS Prompt, you may need to update your STB Systems video
drivers. Video driver incompatibility may also terminate Windows and return you
to the MS-DOS command prompt.

STB video cards are manufactured by STB, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these cards' performance or
reliability.
