KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows version 3.1 Software Development Kit (SDK) "Setup Toolkit
for Windows" manual does not document the /v switch for the Dsklayt2 program.
This switch turns on the verbose option, causing the program to produce
additional messages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Dsklayt2 program options are given on pages 42-43 of the manual. The /v
option is not listed. The verbose option will cause Dsklayt2 to output messages
relating to file compression, creation of the .INF file, and creation of the
disk images as the disk-layout program progresses. These messages may be useful
for debugging because they may allow the user to identify problems with
particular files or operations being carried out by Dsklayt2.

Additional query words: 3.10 docerr
