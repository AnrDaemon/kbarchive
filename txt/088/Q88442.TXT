-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing or running Microsoft Windows you may receive one of the
following error messages:

   Cannot Find File; Check to Ensure Path and Filename Are Correct

   -or-

   Application Execution Error: Cannot Find File; Check to Ensure Path and
   Filename Are Correct

MORE INFORMATION
================

Cannot Find File; Check to Ensure Path and Filename Are Correct
---------------------------------------------------------------

This error is generated for one of the following reasons:

 - You may receive this error when running a PIF, if the Program Filename field
   in the PIF file does not contain a valid path and filename for the program. A
   full pathname should be specified -- for example, C:\MYDIR\MYPROG.EXE. For
   more information, consult the PIF Editor online help.

 - The FILES= statement in the CONFIG.SYS is set too low. The FILES= should be
   set to at least 45. This can happen when installing Windows and when running
   MS-DOS-based applications from Windows.

Cannot Find File; Check to Ensure Path and Filename Are Correct
---------------------------------------------------------------

This message is caused when Windows tries to execute applications listed on the
Run= or Load= lines in the WIN.INI file.

The above error can be caused by one of the following situations:

 - The path to the executable file is invalid (it is misspelled or does not
   exist).

 - The file has been deleted.

 - Either the Load= or Run= line has exceeded the 128-character limit. In
   Windows 3.1, you can use the StartUp group feature to avoid this limitation.

 - There is more than one space between the items on the Load= or Run= line. For
   example, there are two spaces between the applications on the following Load=
   line:

         Load=c:\windows\AppOne.exe  AppTwo.exe
                                   ^^

   If this last situation is the cause, Windows loads the applications after
   displaying the message.
