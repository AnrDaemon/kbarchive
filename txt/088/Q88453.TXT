TITLE   :Right Column of Score Card Is Clipped on Diconix Printers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The rightmost column of the Microsoft Golf for Windows version 1.0 score card
gets clipped when you print on a Diconix 150 or Diconix 150 Plus printer.

This problem occurs because the unprintable region on these printers is quite
large, 0.5 inch to 0.6 inch on the left and 0.83 inch on the right. As a result,
you have only about 7.1 inches of printable area, and the score card is
7.5-inches across.

Additional query words: 1.00 right most right-most
