The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS, versions 1.21, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the user presses the ESC key during a READ or during the execution of a
full-screen editing command, the command terminates. The ON ESCAPE routine does
not execute.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if the ESC key was pressed under these circumstances, check the
value returned from READKEY() and determine if it equals ESC.

The following code demonstrates how to execute a routine in response to the user
pressing ESC in a READ statement:

         x = SPACE(20)
      @ 3,3 GET x
      READ
      IF READKEY() = 12 .OR. READKEY() = 268
         DO <ON ESCAPE routine>
      ENDIF

If the user presses the ESCAPE key in a read, FoxBASE+ saves the values of all
fields except for the field that contains the cursor. This behavior differs from
that of dBASEIII PLUS, which does not save the values of any field under this
condition.

Pressing the ESC key during the execution of an APPEND or EDIT command discards
all changes.

The following code demonstrates how to discard the changes in all fields if the
user presses the ESC key in any field:

         SCATTER TO temp
      @ 3,3 GET field1
      @ 5,5 GET field2
      READ
      IF READKEY() = 12 .OR. READKEY() = 268
         GATHER FROM temp
      ENDIF
