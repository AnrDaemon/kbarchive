TITLE   :BUG: Minimized Windows Help Yields Incorrect Icon
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a Microsoft Windows Help file, when a topic is displayed in a secondary
window, the icon specified in the ICON statement in the [OPTIONS] section of the
Help project (.HPJ) file does not appear when the user minimizes the Help
application. This condition persists even after the user closes the secondary
window.

CAUSE
=====

The topic in the secondary window is stored in a separate Help file. The icon
from this file displaces the icon for the main Help file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, modify the ICON statement in the [OPTIONS] section
of the .HPJ file that contains the topic for the secondary window to specify the
same icon as the main Help file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Microsoft Windows Help version 3.1.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
