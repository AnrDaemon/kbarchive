The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to enable the Windows 3.1 OLE Drag and Drop
functionality in versions 1.0 and 1.1 of Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows. Because these
Lotus applications are pre-OLE applications, you need to manually edit the
REG.DAT file to allow the applications to support OLE drag and drop
functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows version 3.1, you can open or embed a document by dragging a file from
a directory in File Manager and placing the file on a minimized application, or
by dragging the file into the window of an active application. This process is
known as "dragging and dropping."

For OLE drag and drop to work, the application being used in conjunction with
File Manager must directly support dynamic data exchange (DDE) messaging.

For more information about OLE drag and drop, see pages 58-59 of the "Microsoft
Windows User's Guide."
