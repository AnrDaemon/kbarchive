SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Setup Toolkit for Windows, the Source Media Descriptions
section of the .INF file contains one line for each of the disks you use to
install your application. Each of these lines consists of four quoted strings,
separated by commas. The second quoted string is the disk label, which you
create using the disk-layout utilities. This disk label has nothing to do with
the MS-DOS disk label. The disk label in the .INF file comes from the Disk
Labels command on the Options menu in DSKLAYT.EXE and is arbitrarily chosen by
the developer during the disk-layout process.

The Setup Toolkit only uses this disk label to prompt the user for disks. The
Setup Toolkit uses the tag filename in the Source Media Descriptions section to
determine if the proper disk has been placed in the drive.
