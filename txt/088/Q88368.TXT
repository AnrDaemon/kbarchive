The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to view an attachment in version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for
Windows, the following error may occur:

   The application for the attached file <filename> (or one of its
   components) could not be found.

RESOLUTION
==========

To associate the attached file with the originating application, use the
Association command on the Windows File Manager File menu. The Associate command
assigns and associates a specific file extension to a particular application. If
there is no extension or no copy of the originating application, there can be no
association.

To Associate a File
-------------------

1. From the File Manager File menu, choose Associate.

2. Specify the file extension in the File With Extension: box.

3. Specify the application in the Associate With: box. You can use the Browse
   feature to quickly find the application's executable file.
