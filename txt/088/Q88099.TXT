The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft WinLogin, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In WinLogin 1.0, if the fallbackdir= entry in the [WINLOGIN] section of the
WINLOGIN.INI file is incorrectly set to the Windows directory, .INI files in the
WINDOWS directory may become 0 bytes in size.

The fallbackdir= entry should be set to the Windows \FALLBACK subdirectory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If problems occur when running the WinLogin Client software and the .INI files
in the WINDOWS directory have become 0 bytes, the fallbackdir= line in the
[WINLOGIN] section of the WINLOGIN.INI may be set incorrectly. It should NOT be
set to the local WINDOWS directory. Instead, it should be set to
WINDOWS\FALLBACK or any other directory that did not already contain the .INI
files listed in the WLMERGE.INI file.

Edit WINLOGIN.INI and set fallbackdir= correctly,then replace the lost .INI files
with backup copies, provided they are available.

This information applies to version 1.0 of Microsoft WinLogin. For information
