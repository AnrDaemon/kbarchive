TITLE   :BUG: No Dr. Watson Log File in Drive's Root Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Windows operating system, when the Dr. Watson fault- logging
application is installed and an application execution error occurs, the Dr.
Watson's Clues dialog box does not appear. Opening the Dr. Watson application
reveals that an error exists in the <logical drive>:\\DRWATSON.LOG file.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows directory is the root directory of a logical drive, and the logical
drive is listed in the MS-DOS PATH environment variable in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do not map the Windows directory to the root
directory of a logical drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Dr. Watson version 3.1, which
is provided with Windows version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
