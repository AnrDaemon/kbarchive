TITLE   :Swing Stalls When Sounds Play in Golf

SUMMARY
=======

Your swing may stall when playing Microsoft Golf for Windows. This typically
occurs if you are using a nonmultimedia driver. If there is not enough memory,
or your machine is slow (80286/12 MHz or less), the sound causes Microsoft Golf
to stop temporarily.

To test whether this is the source of your problem, turn off the sound effects by
choosing Sound from the Options menu and clearing the check boxes before
starting a round. If Microsoft Golf runs more smoothly, you'll know that the
sound effects are causing the problem. The virtual real sound driver shipped
with Golf and some earlier Windows 3.0 drivers may also cause this problem. Make
sure you have the latest version of the sound driver. For information about the
most recent sound driver for your system, contact your sound card manufacturer.
