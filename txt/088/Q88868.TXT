The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a 
 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you print a page in duplex mode when one page is formatted for landscape and
the other page is formatted for portrait orientation, both pages print in
portrait orientation. This problem occurs when you use the HPPCL5A.DRV printer
driver version 31.3.89 for Microsoft Windows version 3.1 to print on a
Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet Series IIIsi or IIId printer, or when you use the
HP LaserJet 4Si printer driver in Windows 95.

If you print a document in duplex mode and each pair of pages is formatted for
the same orientation, the document prints correctly, even if the document
contains both landscape and portrait formatting. The only situation in which
duplex printing fails to print in the correct orientation is when a pair of
pages is not formatted for the same orientation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with version 31.3.89 of the
HPPCL5A.DRV for Windows version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here as it becomes available.
