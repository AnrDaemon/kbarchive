-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

For the ports LPT4 through LPT9 to be active and usable in Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups, they must be manually added to the [Ports] section of the WIN.INI
file.

NOTE: Some applications (particularly, MS-DOS-based applications) may not print
using ports LPT4 through LPT9.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows for Workgroups supports the use of LPT4 through LPT9 for connecting to
network printers, but you are unable to connect to them unless they are
referenced in the [Ports] section of the WIN.INI file.

A default WIN.INI file only contains parallel port references up to LPT3. For the
extra ports to be usable, they must be manually added to the [Ports] section of
the WIN.INI file.

Adding Extra Ports
------------------

To add the extra ports, do the following:

1. From the Accessories Group, start Notepad.

2. From the File menu, choose Open.

3. In the File Name box, type

   WIN.INI

   then choose the OK button.

4. From the Search menu, choose Find.

5. In the Find What box, type

   [PORTS]

   then choose the OK button.

6. Use your arrow keys to move down the LPT3:= entry in the [PORTS] section.

7. Press the END key, then press the ENTER key.

8. On the new line, type "LPT4:=" (without the quotation marks), then press
   ENTER.

9. Repeat step 8 for LPT5 through LPT9.

10. From the File menu, choose Save.

11. From the File menu, choose Exit.

All parallel ports through LPT9 are now available for use.
