SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) provide a CFileException class. The
CFileException class includes public data members that contain operating- system
errors and C Run-time errors that may be generated by certain file operations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The CFile and CStdioFile classes may throw a CFileException when certain error
conditions occur; however, these classes do not throw a CFileException when the
end of file is reached. If an application using the CFile or CStdioFile class
needs to check for the end-of-file condition when reading from a file, the
return values from the Read() and ReadString() member functions should be
checked.

CFile::Read returns the actual number of bytes read. If this number is less than
the bytes requested, then the end of file has been reached.

CStdioFile::ReadString returns a NULL pointer when the end of file has been
reached.
