-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS, versions 1.21, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Only one ON KEY command can be active at one time. It is active only during a
READ or when a full-screen editing command is in effect.

This restriction applies to all ON commands in FoxBASE+ (ON ERROR, ON ESCAPE, and
ON KEY). Once issued, an ON command remains in effect until another ON command
of the same type is issued or the application ends.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following program illustrates that when an application issues a second ON
KEY command, it replaces the first ON KEY command:

      CLEAR
      mvarname = "                    "
      ON KEY = 315 DO prg1
      ON KEY = 316 DO prg2
      @ 3,5 SAY "This is a test of on key"
      @ 4,5 SAY "Please enter a string when finished"
      @ 5,5 GET mvarname
      @ 6,5 SAY "F1 = prg1   F2 = prg2"
      READ

      ** PROCEDURE file prg1 **
      PROCEDURE prg1
      @7,5 SAY "This won't display"
      RETURN

      ** PROCEDURE file prg2 **
      PROCEDURE prg2
      @8,5 SAY "This will display"
      RETURN
