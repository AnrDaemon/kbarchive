SUMMARY
=======

When running Microsoft Windows operating system on a computer using an early
model AST RAMpage memory board, you may experience disappearing mouse pointers
and incorrect keyboard input.

According to AST technical support, you should be using version 6.1 or later of
the AST RAMpage board when running Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Additional things to check on the RAMpage board:

1. Look at the soldered side of the board and find a printed circuit board part
   number ending with -302C or -302D.

2. If the part number ends in -302D or higher, you have a good board.

3. If the part number ends in -302C and there is a wire jumper running along the
   back of the board, you have a good board.

4. If you have a -302C board without a jumper, you must have your board
   upgraded.

5. If you have a board earlier than -302C, it will probably not work correctly
   and should be upgraded.
