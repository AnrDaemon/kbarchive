SYMPTOMS
========

Certus NoVi is an anti-virus terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program. Certus
NoVi version 1.01 causes the system to hang when you exit Windows 3.1. This
occurs only when running Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you perform a standard installation of NoVi version 1.01, NoVi adds the
following lines to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

      c:\novi\noviboot.exe
      c:\novi\novitsr.exe

According to Certus technical support, there are updated drivers available
(version 1.1) that correct this problem. The updated files can be obtained by
contacting Certus technical support.

(Note that NoVi version 1.1 adds NOVIWIN.EXE to the load= line in the WIN.INI
file, and creates a group called NOVI.)
