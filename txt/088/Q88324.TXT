SUMMARY
=======

Creative Labs' SoundBlaster version 2.0 needs an updated driver to function

MORE INFORMATION
================

SoundBlaster 1.0, 1.5, 2.0
--------------------------

There are three versions of the SoundBlaster sound card: 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0. To
determine if you have a 2.0 version:

 - Read the documentation that came with your SoundBlaster.

 - Look at the back of the card; the 2.0 version has an extra line-in port in
   addition to the microphone-in and speaker-out ports found on version 1.5.

SoundBlaster Pro CP1330 and CP1600
----------------------------------

There are two versions of the SoundBlaster Pro sound card: CP1330 and the newer
CP1600. To determine which model you have:

 - Look for the model numbers on the sound card.

 - Look at the first four digits of the serial number, which are 1600 for the
   CP1600.

All the Windows 3.1 drivers for the SoundBlaster cards can be found on Creative
Labs' BBS. They are in self-extracting format. The files to be downloaded from
the Creative Labs BBS are as follows:
