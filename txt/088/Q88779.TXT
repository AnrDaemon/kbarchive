The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Here are some examples of SMTP address syntax:

 - USER@COMPANY.COM

 - USER@UNIVERSITY.EDU

 - USER@GOVERNMENT.APPS.GOV

 - USER@US.NAVY.MIL

The "USER" portion is mapped to the mailbag name when the gateway receives the
message. This name can be no longer than 10 characters--something you should
consider when planning your naming conventions if an SMTP gateway will be used
in the environment.

The gateway maps everything after the @ sign to a network and postoffice name.
For more information on this topic, see the "Mapping Microsoft Mail Addresses to
SMTP Addresses" section in Chapter 3 of the "Microsoft Mail Administrator's
Guide."
