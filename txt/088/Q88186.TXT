======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows version 3.1 Video Seven video drivers do not support the Video Seven
VGA cards using Headland Technology/Video Seven HT-216 or HT-217 chip sets.

During Express Setup, these chip sets are identified as Video Seven. Setup hangs
the computer when you switch from MS-DOS-character-mode to Windows- mode Setup.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, run Custom Setup and change the video selection
from Video Seven to standard VGA.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The HT-216 and HT-217 video chip sets are part of new Video Seven VGA cards. If
you need to use extended VGA support, then contact Video Seven for updated video
drivers.

Northgate Computers will be shipping computers using these new video chip sets,
and Video Seven will also be shipping video cards using these chip sets.
