KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

 - You have a Northgate 286 computer running Microsoft Windows, and your system
   stops responding (hangs or locks up) or crashes randomly.

 - You have a Northgate 386 computer running Microsoft Windows, and your system
   loads Windows once, but hangs on the second attempt to run Windows.

CAUSE
=====

 - Northgate 286 computers equipped with the American Megatrends Incorporated
   (AMI) BIOS need the /M:8 HIMEM.SYS switch to use extended memory properly.

 - Northgate 386 computers equipped with an AMI BIOS dated 1989 need the /M:8
   HIMEM.SYS switch to use extended memory properly.

If you have the HIMEM.SYS file installed without this switch, you may experience
the symptoms above.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a text editor, such as Windows Notepad, to add the switch to the HIMEM.SYS
device line in your CONFIG.SYS file as follows:

       DEVICE=C:\HIMEM.SYS /M:8

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 3.x requires the HIMEM.SYS driver to use extended memory. HIMEM.SYS must
be included in your CONFIG.SYS file so that Windows can run in standard or
enhanced mode on your computer. HIMEM.SYS uses the A20 handler on your machine
to access extended memory.

The Windows Setup program installs the HIMEM.SYS file to use A20 handler #1 on a
Northgate 286 or 386 (with AMI BIOS). This computer uses A20 handler #8 to
access extended memory. You must specify the "M:8" parameter in your CONFIG.SYS
file for Windows to function correctly on this computer.

The Northgate product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
