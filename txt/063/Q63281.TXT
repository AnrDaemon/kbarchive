SUMMARY
=======

The error message

   Unsupported DOS Version

may occur if you try to run Microsoft Windows in enhanced mode on a
Hewlett-Packard (HP) computer when MS-DOS is being run on the computer instead
of HP-DOS.

You must be running HP-DOS; running generic MS-DOS on a Hewlett-Packard machine
is not a supported configuration.

This article applies to Windows 3.0; it does not apply to later versions of
Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine which version of DOS is being run, type the following at the DOS
command prompt:

   COMMAND

With most DOS versions, if you are running HP-DOS both the Microsoft and the
Hewlett-Packard copyrights should appear. If only the Microsoft copyright
appears, you may be running MS-DOS.

Type the following at the DOS prompt to confirm the version of DOS you are
running:

   VER

HP-DOS or MS-DOS followed by a version number should appear.

It has been reported that some Hewlett-Packard machines have been packaged with
the generic version of MS-DOS. In this case, contact the dealer from which the
computer was purchased to update to HP-DOS.
