-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0 states that you can create
characters by pressing the ALT key while you type a three-digit character code
on the numeric keypad. The character appears properly on the screen when you
type it, but it may print as something else.

CAUSE
=====

Programs running under Windows display characters with the ANSI character set.
Most computers and printers use character sets that are different from the ANSI
character set for character codes above 127.

A given printer prints higher-order (character codes above 127) characters using
the OEM character set built into that printer.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can determine the proper print character by looking up the number of the
character in the your printer's documentation and entering the given number. The
character may not appear properly on the screen, but it prints correctly.

NOTE: When using the Modern, Script, or Roman font built into Windows, use the
ANSI higher-order character table instead of the OEM table. The Modern, Script,
and Roman fonts are made as ANSI fonts only.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enter an ANSI higher-order character, rather than an OEM character, press the
ALT key while you type the number of the character on the keypad with a leading
zero. For example, to enter OEM character 163 (that is, a "u" with an apostrophe
over it on IBM PC), do the following:

1. Press the NUMLOCK key.

2. Press ALT+163.

3. Release the ALT key and Press the NUMLOCK key.

To enter ANSI character 163 (English pound sign in Windows), do the following:

1. Press the NUMLOCK key.

2. Press ALT+0163.

3. Release the ALT key and Press the NUMLOCK key.
