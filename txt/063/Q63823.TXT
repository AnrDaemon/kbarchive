SUMMARY
=======

You must check the Presentation Mode box from the Printer Setup menu of Control
Panel to print in presentation mode on a Hewlett-Packard (HP) PaintJet XL
printer with Microsoft Windows version 3.0. If the Presentation Mode box is not
checked, Windows will reset the printer to normal mode, perform its print job,
then return the printer to presentation mode. This happens even if the switches
on the printer are set to presentation mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To print from presentation mode with Windows 3.0, do the following:

1. From the Main group of Program Manager, choose Control Panel.

2. From Control Panel, choose Printers.

3. Choose the HP PaintJet printer and select Configure.

4. From the Printers - Configure menu, choose Setup.

5. Choose Options and then check the Presentation Mode box.

When Presentation Mode is selected, the PaintJet XL uses an interlace technique
that gives you improved print quality. However, printing time is increased.
