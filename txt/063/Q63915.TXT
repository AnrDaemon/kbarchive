Unlike other PCs, the Tandy 2500 XL has MS-DOS in ROM. By default, the
Tandy 2500 XL does not read the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT file so any
changes Microsoft Windows makes to CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT are not read
by the system.

To disable this feature, run the CMOS Setup program for the Tandy and turn
on the settings for the "Check for Config.sys" and "Check for
Autoexec.bat."

The default for the ROM DOS files and buffers is 10. This can also be
changed through the Tandy system Setup program.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a 3rdparty KBHW
