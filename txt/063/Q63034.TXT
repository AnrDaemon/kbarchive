SUMMARY
=======

The NEC Multispeed is an 80286 based laptop PC with an LCD screen and CGA
adapter. When installing Microsoft Windows version 3.0, the CGA option should be
used. The screen display quality is poor unless the command

   MODE CO80

is issued prior to starting Windows. This command can be included in AUTOEXEC.BAT
or a batch file to start Windows.

The program MODE.COM usually resides in the directory where the MS-DOS files are
stored. Executing MODE CO80 sets the graphics mode to color and 80 columns.
