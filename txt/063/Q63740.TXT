The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you run an unsupported network (such as PC File Server) with Microsoft
Windows, you may receive the following error message:

   System Error: Network Error On Drive <x>:

where "<x>" is the name of your drive.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you choose Connect Net Drive from the Drive menu in File
Manager. File Manager then activates a network redirector that may not operate
properly under Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the redirector is causing the problem, install Windows without a network and
connect to network drives and sharing devices prior to loading Windows.
