SUMMARY
=======

The Error Handler option for the Microsoft Windows version 3.0 PostScript driver
is not visible in the Printer dialog box.

This option is available in the Print Options dialog box for the PostScript
printer, although it is not displayed. To access the error handler, do the
following:

1. Run Control Panel and choose the Printers icon.

2. Verify that the PostScript printer is the selected printer.

3. Choose the Configure button (ALT+C).

4. Choose the Setup button (ALT+S).

5. Choose the Options button (ALT+O).

6. Press ALT+E to select the error handler.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Selecting this option downloads the error handler to the printer or to a file on
disk. With the error handler downloaded, information related to a printer error
is either printed or saved to a file.

NOTE: Windows 3.1 preselects the Error Handler option for its PostScript driver.
