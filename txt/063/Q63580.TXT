======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Windows File Manager Search command causes Windows to stop
responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

An invalid search string used in the Search dialog box causes this problem.

For example, the following process hangs the system:

1. Run File Manager.

2. From the File menu, choose Search.

3. Change *.* to .COM (note: NO leading asterisk).

The system is now unstable. ALT+TAB opens the Program Manager, at which point you
must exit and restart Windows.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.0. This
problem was corrected and does not occur in later versions of Windows.

Additional query words: 3.0 3.00 3.0a 3.00a
