======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience problems reading the text in non-Windows applications running
under Microsoft Windows version 3.0 on a computer with a monochrome VGA display.
Although this usually occurs in enhanced mode, it can also happen in real and
standard modes.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can correct this problem by adjusting the contrast every time the
application is used.

A better workaround is to rerun Setup and select "VGA" rather than "VGA with
Monochrome display." However, this may not always work.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.00 win30
