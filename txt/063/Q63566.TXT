======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install the Keyboard Enhancement Option in WordPerfect's Repeat
Performance (RP.SYS) in the CONFIG.SYS file, you cannot run MS-DOS applications
under Windows version 3.0 or 3.1.

If you are using Windows 3.0, the following error message is displayed when you
try to run an MS-DOS application:

   Insufficient memory

If you are using Windows 3.1 and you run a full-screen MS-DOS window or other
MS-DOS application, your system may stop responding (hang). No error message is
displayed.

CAUSE
=====

Repeat Performance adds the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

      DEVICE=c:\rp.sys=on repeat=70 delay=20 turbo=70 ctrl
             turbo=120 buffer=on size=200

WORKAROUND
==========

Removing this line may allow you to run MS-DOS applications from within Windows
without receiving the "Insufficient Memory" error.

In addition, you can type "RP OFF" before entering Windows to disable Repeat
Performance. On exiting Windows you can then type "RP ON" to activate Repeat
Performance.
