SYMPTOMS
========

If you have more than one macro with the same key sequence, and one of the
macros was created in the Recorder program packaged with Microsoft Windows
version 3.0, Windows replays the Recorder-created macro instead of a macro
created from other Windows-based applications.

For example, if you write a macro in Microsoft Excel that is activated by the
CTRL+A key sequence, and you also have a macro created for the Recorder
application that uses CTRL+A, the Recorder macro is activated when you press
CTRL+A. This occurs if Recorder is running in a window or as an icon.

If the Recorder macro is set to play back into Any Application, the macro
keystrokes are sent to the application that is running. If the Recorder macro is
set to play back into Same Application, the Recorder attempts to switch control
to the application where the macro was recorded and then play back into THAT
application. If the application is not running, Recorder terminates with an
error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

To change Recorder's playback, do the following:

1. From the Options menu, choose Preferences.

2. The Default Preferences dialog box appears. Under Playback To, select Any
   Application or Same Application.
