TITLE   :BUG: PWB Print Does Not Put CR/LF at EOL If Text Selected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:1.0,1.1; OS/2:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.1 
 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.0 or 1.1, when a region of text
is selected and the Print function is invoked, the resulting output contains
linefeed characters (0x0A) at the end of each line, rather than a carriage
return-linefeed (<CR><LF>) combination (0x0D and 0x0A).

Some printer drivers do not recognize this as a valid end-of-line (EOL) character
and do not print correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround for this problem is to write a program that translates each 0x0A
found in the output file to the bytes 0x0D and 0x0A, or use a printer driver
that understands this type of file. In fact, most printers have an escape
sequence or DIP switch to enable it to recognize this type of file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PWB versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce this problem, open a file that contains the <CR><LF>
combination at the end of each line. Highlight a region of text in the file and
from the File menu choose Print. Tab to the second field and type in the
following:

   " copy %s test.txt" (without the quotation marks)

This will copy the region of selected to the file TEST.TXT. Using a standard hex
file viewer, you can see that the end of a line is denoted by a single 0A. If
you look at the original file using the hex viewer, it will contain 0A 0D at the
end of each line.

Programmer's WorkBench will recognize this type of file (with a single 0A at each
end of line) and display it correctly if you try to open it within PWB, but many
printer drivers do not understand this type of file.
