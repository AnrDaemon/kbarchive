-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows-based portion of the Windows 3.0 Setup program does not
support the installation of third-party display, keyboard, mouse, or network
drivers. To install a third-party driver, it is necessary to use one of two
methods below, depending on how the third-party driver manufacturer has supplied
the drivers to you.

This information does not apply to third-party printer drivers. Third-party
printer drivers may be installed with the Windows Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the MS-DOS Portion of Setup
---------------------------------

If the third-party driver(s) are supplied on a disk that contains an OEMSETUP.INF
file, they may be installed through the MS-DOS portion of Setup. Exit Windows to
the MS-DOS command prompt, and run Setup from the Windows 3.0 directory. Since
Windows 3.0 is already installed, the MS-DOS Setup program goes into maintenance
mode and does not require you to reinstall Windows.

At this point, override the default detection for the type of driver you are
installing (that is, display, keyboard, mouse, or network). Then choose "Other -
Requires Disk Provided by Hardware Manufacturer." Setup then prompts you to
insert the driver disk and installs the drivers.

Installing Manually with SYSTEM.INI
-----------------------------------

If the third-party driver(s) are supplied without an OEMSETUP.INF file, they must
be installed by manually editing the SYSTEM.INI file. Instructions for the
necessary modifications should be provided to you along with the third-party
driver(s). If not, contact the driver manufacturer for assistance.
