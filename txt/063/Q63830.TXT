======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In some cases, the final page may not be fully printed when printing a file from
within Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) versions 1.0 and 1.1.

CAUSE
=====

This usually results from the printer buffer not dumping the end of file.

RESOLUTION
==========

One work-around to this problem is to force a form feed to the printer after the
file is printed in order to clear the buffer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an example of how to set the PWB "printcmd" switch in the
TOOLS.INI file to print the file and force a form feed:

   printcmd: copy %s+form.txt prn

Note that the FORM.TXT file is a file that you must create in the current
directory that contains a single form feed character (ASCII 12). You can create
this file in PWB by opening a new file and pressing CTRL+P (the quote function)
and then CTRL+L to insert a literal form feed character.
