======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

To use a cursor to edit a file in System Configuration Editor (SysEdit) without
using a mouse, you must first press ALT+TAB to exit the SysEdit program and then
press ALT+TAB to return to SysEdit.

When you press ALT+TAB to return to SysEdit, the edit cursor is in the active
window. (SysEdit is not a documented program in the "Microsoft Windows User's
Guide.")

NOTE: You can use the CTRL+TAB key sequence to change the active window in
SysEdit, but this does not correct the cursor display problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a.
This problem was corrected in later versions of Windows.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a WIN30
