SUMMARY
=======

To install Microsoft Windows version 3.00 on a machine with different graphic
resolutions, install the program as if you were installing from a network
server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. After expanding all of the files in a directory on your hard drive, type
   SETUP/N from the directory in which the expanded files are located.

2. During this setup, have the Setup program install Windows 3.0 into a
   different directory while selecting the graphic resolution that you want to
   install. When the screen asks if you want to modify the CONFIG.SYS and
   AUTOEXEC.BAT files, select the option that allows you to modify them
   yourself.

3. Repeat step 2 for each different resolution that you want to install.

4. Modify the CONFIG.SYS to include the HIMEM.SYS and SMARTDRV.SYS device
   drivers.

5. Modify the PATH in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to include the Windows directory in
   which the files were expanded.

To start Windows 3.0 with the desired graphic resolution, change directories to
where you installed Windows with the desired resolution and type WIN.
