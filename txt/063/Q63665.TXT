SUMMARY
=======

The command-line switch /M:7 must be used to use HIMEM.SYS version 2.60,
released with Microsoft Windows version 3.0, with early Dell 286-based machines.
Although this line indicates a Toshiba 1600, early Dell models cannot boot
properly if HIMEM.SYS is installed without this switch. Typically, the system
attempts to boot from the hard drive and stops responding (hangs) right after
HIMEM.SYS is loaded.

The line

      DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS /M:7

is the standard entry into CONFIG.SYS for early Dell 286-based models.
