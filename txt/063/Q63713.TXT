SUMMARY
=======

MS-DOS Editor (EDIT.EXE) occupies approximately 289 kilobytes (K) of the
available program space; therefore, the largest file size MS-DOS Editor can edit
is equal to the total space available for programs minus 289K.

For example, if the MEM command reports the following

   655,360 bytes total conventional memory
   655,360 bytes available to MS-DOS
   585,584 largest executable program size

the largest file MS-DOS Editor can load into memory is as follows:

       585K  Largest executable program size
     - 289K  Memory MS-DOS Editor occupies
     ---------------------------------------

       296K  Space available for text file
