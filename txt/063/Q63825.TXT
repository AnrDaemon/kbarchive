-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may get the following error message when you try to start a non-Windows
application in a window under Microsoft Windows version 3.0:

   You cannot run this application while other high-resolution applications are
   running fullscreen. The application will be suspended until a low-resolution
   or text application is running fullscreen. Check the PIF settings to ensure
   they are correct.

However, if you start the same application fullscreen and then switch it into a
window (by pressing ALT+SPACEBAR), it runs without any problem.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior often occurs with non-Windows applications that are text based but
have an initial graphics logo screen. Some applications, such as PFS Write and
PFS File, have an initial graphics screen bearing the logo of the application.
Because of this initial graphics screen, the applications cannot start in a
window. After the initial logo screen is displayed, these and many other
applications switch to a text-based display. For this reason, after the initial
graphics screen is displayed, the application can run in a window.

NOTE: "Print preview" or "page preview" screens are usually graphics-type
displays. Your application may lock up and give you the above error message if
you attempt to use "print preview" or "page preview" type features while running
the application in a window.

WORKAROUND
==========

Unless you can disable or skip this initial logo screen, you must start the
application in a full screen and then reduce it to a window after it is
running.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem also occurs with a program such as Microsoft Word 5.0 if it is
started in a text mode other than 25 line mode (such as 43 line mode on an
EGA/VGA and 50 line mode on a VGA). This is an example of an application that
ends up in text mode but transitions first through what looks like a graphics
mode.
