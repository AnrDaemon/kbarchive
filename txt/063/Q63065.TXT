SUMMARY
=======


The wing aspect ratio equation shown on Page 54 of the "Information Manual and
Flight Handbook" for Flight Simulator version 4.00 is as follows:

                  Wing span
   Aspect ratio = ---------                (Equation 1)
                    Chord

In John Anderson's "Introduction to Flight," on Page 193, the aspect ratio is
given as follows:

                  (Wing span)^2
   Aspect ratio = -------------            (Equation 2)
                    Wing area

These two equations are the same. "Chord" is the average width of the wing. "Wing
area" is the wing span multiplied by the average wing width (A = WL). Thus, the
wing span from Equation 2 cancels out and Equation 2 reduces to Equation 1. The
following is the proof:

                  (Wing span)^2
   Aspect ratio = -------------            (Equation 2)
                    Wing area

                  (Wing span)(Wing span)
   Aspect ratio = -----------------------
                  (Wing span)(Wing width)

                  (Wing span)   Wing span
   Aspect Ratio = ----------- = ---------  (Equation 1)
                  (Wing width)     Chord
