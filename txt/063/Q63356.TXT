SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information on SYSTEM.INI options that pertain to the
Microsoft Windows 3.0 Novell NetWare driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SYSTEM.INI is the Windows system configuration textfile. It is also located
in the user's personal directory on the network, and holds information on system
level device options. The [NetWare] section holds information specifically
related to the NetWare Windows driver. The following is an example.

      [NetWare]   RestoreDrives=TRUE/false

The RestoreDrives= parameter controls how NetWare drive mappings are treated when
you exit Windows. In the default mode (RestoreDrives=TRUE), when you exit
Windows all drive mappings are restored to their previous state before Windows
was executed. If you had performed any additional drive mappings while within
Windows, these are removed when you exit. Setting RestoreDrives=FALSE preserves
on exit all drive mappings made while Windows was running.

The following parameter controls how resource visibility is treated in
enhanced-mode Windows on a NetWare system:

      [NetWare]   NWShareHandles=true/FALSE

In the default setting (NWShareHandles=FALSE), the NetWare system behaves with
the inherited-visibility method. The optional NWShareHandles=TRUE setting makes
the enhanced-mode NetWare driver use the Global visibility method instead.
