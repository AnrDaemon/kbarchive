SUMMARY
=======

Page 598 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" discusses two methods of
indicating the beginning address of the expanded-memory page frame created by
EMM386.SYS. The second method is incorrect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first method uses the frame= parameter and creates a LIM 3.2-compatible page
frame beginning at D000:0000. The second method is incorrect and is shown as
follows:

      device=emm386.sys 512 p0=D000 p1=D400 p2=D800 p4=DC00

This command line in CONFIG.SYS generates the following error:

   WARNING - EMM386 installed without a LIM 3.2 compatible Page Frame

The "p4" parameter on the command line is the source of the error. The fourth
page of the page frame is specified with the parameter "p3", not "p4". Hence, to
generate a LIM 3.2-compatible page frame, the command line should read as
follows:

      device=emm386.sys 512 p0=D000 p1=D400 p2=D800 p3=DC00

A LIM 3.2-compatible page frame is required in order to use expanded memory with
most applications that use expanded memory. If, while using EMM386.SYS, your
application reports no expanded memory, verify the proper addressing of the
pages "p0", "p1", "p2", and "p3", and/or use the frame= parameter to explicitly
set the starting address of the entire page frame.
