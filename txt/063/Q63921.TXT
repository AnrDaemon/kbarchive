SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mouse does not function properly on a Western Digital WDM2 or
WDM20 motherboard if it is connected to the PS/2 mouse port. The keyboard ROM on
this motherboard causes erratic mouse movement when Windows is in standard or
enhanced mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are four possible corrections to the problem, as follows:

 - Connect the mouse to one of the serial ports.

 - Use a bus mouse such as the Microsoft or Logitech bus mouse.

 - Send the motherboard to a Western Digital Service center to have the keyboard
   ROM chip replaced.

 - Modify the HIMEM.SYS line in the CONFIG.SYS file to read HIMEM.SYS /M:2.

The PS/2 mouse port on a non-PS/2 computer is a special adapter port on the
machine. You use a serial mouse with a special adapter on one end to connect to
this adapter port. The PS/2 mouse port uses a hardware specific interrupt
(usually IRQ12) to communicate with the mouse instead of the normal serial ports
that are on IRQ3 and IRQ4.
