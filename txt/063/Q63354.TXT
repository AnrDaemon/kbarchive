The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you want to use a DOS mouse driver with a Logitech mouse in conjunction with
Microsoft Windows 3.0, you must use version 4.1 or later of the Logitech DOS
mouse driver.

Windows 3.0 does not use the DOS mouse driver; it uses its own internal mouse
driver. However, if you want to use a mouse in DOS applications, a DOS mouse
driver is necessary.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Logitech version 4.1 driver has the following attributes:

   Driver     Size   Date
   ------     ----   ----

   MOUSE.COM  19784  10-02-89
   MOUSE.SYS  19898  10-02-89

Note that since these drivers have the same names as the Microsoft equivalents,
the Windows version 3.0 Setup program normally replaces them with the new
Microsoft version 7.04 DOS mouse driver.

NOTE: The Microsoft 7.04 driver should NOT be used. Make sure to use the Logitech
driver 4.1 or later.

Using the wrong driver may cause loss of mouse operation or pixels to be left on
the screen when the mouse is moved.

Version 4.1 of the Logitech DOS mouse driver can be obtained from Logitech
Technical Support or by modem from the Logitech electronic bulletin board
service.
