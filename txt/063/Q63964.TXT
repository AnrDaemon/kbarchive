SUMMARY
=======

If the Apple System Installer is used to update the operating system to version
6.0.4 or 6.0.5 on a Macintosh running a Microsoft Mail server, the Microsoft
Mail error message "The Microsoft Mail Server could not be loaded because" with
no reason or explanation given may be generated.

To solve this problem, the System Folder must be reinstalled. It is important to
install NEW files in the System Folder, not update existing ones. Do the
following:

1. Save your fonts, desk accessories (DAs), and other needed files (such as the
   "Microsoft Mail Data file") by removing them from the System Folder since the
   current system software files will be replaced by new ones.

2. Restart the machine using the System Tools disk.

3. Delete the System Folder on the hard disk.

4. Run the Installer on the System Tools disk to reinstall the System software.
