The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Setup program for Microsoft Windows version 3.0 does not modify
the configuration files if you have OS/2 installed on the machine.
The setup program searches the path of the machine for an "OS2"
directory off the root of the boot drive and displays the following
error:

   You are running a system that is configured for OS/2. Setup did not make
   changes to your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.

Since OS/2 is a high-level operating system, Setup does not change the
configuration files to protect the integrity of the system. As the
user, you have this responsibility. Changing configuration files can
hamper the installation of Windows 3.0 in the DOS compatibility box
of OS/2; modifying these files may also cause problems with OS/2. This
type of installation is not recommended.
