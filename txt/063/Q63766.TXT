SUMMARY
=======

When you choose File Details from the View menu of Microsoft Windows File
Manager, the seconds portion of the last modification time is displayed as an
even number. If you open the View menu, choose Sort By, and select Last
Modification Date, the files are displayed in properly sorted order, according
to last date and time modified.

Seconds are always rounded to an even number because there are only 5 bits to
represent seconds for a filename. They are stored in 2 second increments (0 to
29).
