TITLE   :FIX: Protection Violation Compiling BLOCK DATA with Implied DO
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN compiler for OS/2, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to compile an application fails and the compiler generates a
protection violation. This error does not occur when compiling the application
in MS-DOS or in an MS-DOS compatibility window in OS/2.

CAUSE
=====

The application contains a BLOCK DATA subprogram that uses an implied DO list
and the compiler command line includes the /4Ya option switch.

RESOLUTION
==========

To address this problem, perform one of the following two steps:

 - Change the compiler command line to remove the /4Ya compiler option switch
   when the application includes a BLOCK DATA subprogram.

 - Modify the source code to remove the implied DO list from the BLOCK DATA
   subprogram.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN version 5.0 for OS/2.
This problem was corrected in FORTRAN version 5.1 for MS-DOS and OS/2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code example demonstrates this problem.

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile options needed: /4Ya to reproduce problem

         BLOCK DATA
         INTEGER VAR(2)
         COMMON /TEST/ VAR
         DATA (VAR(I), I = 1, 2) /0, 1/ 
         END
