SUMMARY
=======

When using soft fonts (such as those produced by Bitstream or Hewlett-Packard)
in Microsoft Windows, the font displayed on the screen may be different from the
font selected. This often occurs if you have changed the order of your screen
fonts in the [Fonts] section of the WIN.INI file. Changing the order of the
fonts that are listed in this section can sometimes correct this problem.

For example, change the order from

      Symbol 8,10 (VGA res)=SYMBOLE.FON
      ITCZapfDingbats 6,8 (VGA res)=zd24e.fon

To the following:

      ITCZapfDingbats 6,8 (VGA res)=zd24e.fon
      Symbol 8,10 (VGA res)=SYMBOLE.FON

After you modify the WIN.INI file, you must exit Windows for the change to take
effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows programs search the WIN.INI file for screen font information and stop at
the first font file that returns the correct information, based on the search.
Different programs may indicate different results, based on the criteria that
they use. There are fonts that may have similar information in the beginning of
the file, causing the program to stop its search and display an incorrect screen
font. Font installation packages such as the Bitstream Font Installation program
create and install screen fonts into the WIN.INI file.
