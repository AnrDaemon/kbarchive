SUMMARY
=======

The DataProducts SPG 8050 laser printer is not supported by Microsoft Windows
and does not emulate any printer supported by Windows. The only Windows driver
that works with the SPG 8050 is the Generic/Text Only driver.

The DataProducts SPG 8050 laser printer emulates the Okidata 92/93 series
(without the IBM ROM) and the IDS Prism. However, neither of these printers are
supported (or emulate anything supported) under Windows.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
