TITLE   :FIX: L4050 Incorrectly Documented in Online Help
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When linking a very small program with /EXEPACK, the Microsoft LINK utility
version 5.1 sometimes gives the following error message:

   LINK: warning L4050: file not suitable for /EXEPACK; relink without

The online Help documentation returns the following incorrect information:

   LINK warning L4050

   too many public symbols for sorting

   The linker uses the stack and all available memory in the near heap to sort
   public symbols for the /MAP option. If the number of public symbols exceeds
   the space available for them, this warning is issued and the symbols are not
   sorted in the map file but are listed in an arbitrary order.

   Reduce the number of symbols.

RESOLUTION
==========

The correct documentation for this error (except the number) is as follows and
can be found in the online Help under L1114:

   Fatal LINK error L1114

   file not suitable for /EXEPACK; relink without

   For the linked program, the size of the packed load image plus packing
   overhead was larger than that of the unpacked load image.

   Relink without the /EXEPACK option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the LINK utility version 5.1.
This problem was corrected in the LINK utility version 5.13.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because of its noncritical nature, this error was changed from its previous
status of a fatal error to a simple warning in LINK version 5.1. The warning
associated with L4050 in earlier versions of LINK rarely appears in LINK 5.1;
however, if it does, it will have the number L4070.

Additional query words: 5.10
