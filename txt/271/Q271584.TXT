-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using an Outlook client, and you create a profile with the Newprof
tool and the Profgen tool, you may not be able to download the Outlook Address
Book.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the path for the OfflineAddressBookPath statement
does not exist on the drive where the Outlook Address Book files are stored.

The following section in the .prf file indicates an invalid path for the
OfflineAddressBookPath= statement. When this file is used, the profile is
generated but you are not able to download the Offline Address Book and no error
message is displayed.

   Settings for the Microsoft Exchange Server computer

   [Service2]

   OfflineAddressBookPath="<Windir>\Profiles\<Username>\Local
   Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook"

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, ensure the path that is specified in the
OfflineAddressBookPath= statement resides on the hard disk before you use
Profgen and Newprof to create the profile.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Newprof tool does not create folders for items that do not already exist.
This includes folders that are named using the <username> variable.
