SYMPTOMS
========

The Cron service may stop unexpectedly after some jobs have been started. When
this occurs, the Cron service reports CreateNamedPipe error 2 or 231. Typically,
the Event log records an entry similar to the following message:

   Event Type: Error
   Event Source: CronService
   Event Category: None
   Event ID: 1001
   Date: 8/5/2000
   Time: 8:57:49 AM
   User: N/A
   Computer: LC2-LFD10
   Description: Cron Service Win32 API CreateNamedPipe failed with the error 2

CAUSE
=====

Cron.exe generates an access violation because of an insufficient error message
buffer and resultant data corruption.
