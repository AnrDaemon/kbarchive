TITLE   :Password Synchronization Doesn't Work Using Syntax Given in Help
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbdocerr w2000sfu kbUNIXService

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Services for Unix (SFU) version 2.0 Help suggests using the following syntax to
use the Password Synchronization feature:

   SYNC_HOSTS=(domainController[,portNumber[,encryptionKey]])[,
   (domainController[,portNumber[,encryptionKey]])]...

For example:

   SYNC_HOSTS=(dc1.domain.com,6677,encryptkey),(dc2.domain.com,6677,encryptkey)

However, when you use this syntax, you may receive the following error message
when you try to use Password Synchronization:

   newcifs ssod.so7[7559]: Error in config file /etc/sso.conf: invalid ',' found
   in sync_host values.

If you issue the "grep SYNC_HOSTS /etc/sso.conf" command on the UNIX-based
computer, you may receive the following error message:

   SYNC_HOSTS=(dc1.domain.com,6677,encryptkey,machine@here),
   (dc2.domain.com,6677,encryptkey,machine@here) which is incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the syntax mentioned in the "Symptoms" section is
incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the correct syntax. There should not be a comma
between the domain controllers.

The syntax for the entry should appear as the following syntax:

   SYNC_HOSTS=(DomainController[,portNumber[,encryptionKey]])[(DomainController[,portNumber[,encryptkey]])]...

For example:

   SYNC_HOSTS=(dc1.domain.com,6677,encryptkey)(dc2.domain.com,6677,encryptkey)

Note: There is no comma (,) between the two domain controller sections.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 2000.

Additional query words: sync hosts
