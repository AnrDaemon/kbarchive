TITLE   :XADM: Directory Service Does Not Start with Event ID 1171
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server directory service may not start and the following event ID
1171 error message may be logged in the application event log:

   Event ID: 1171
   Source: MSExchangeDS
   Type: Error
   Category: Internal Processing

   Description:
   Exception e0010002 has occurred with parameters 9 and 2 (internal ID 30c043f).
   Contact Microsoft Technical Support for assistance.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if a directory is restored from backup on a server (for
this example, server A) and the directory contains knowledge of a server in the
directory's site that has been deleted (for this example, server B).

After the tape restoration, when server A starts, server A attempts to
synchronize with the other servers in the site and determines that server B has
been deleted from the site, but server A maintains a reference to the deleted
server.


While server A is in this state (this state persists until server A runs the
knowledge consistency checker process), if server B is re-installed in the site
with the same name, another reference to server B is added to the directory on
server A (which results in two references to server B). This inconsistency may
prevent the directory service on server B from starting.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
