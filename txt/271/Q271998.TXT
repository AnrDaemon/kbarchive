OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

During replication between the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) and Backup Domain
Controllers (BDCs), Event Viewer may record the following error message:

   Event ID: 5718
   Description: Full synchronization of xxx database for the Domain Controller
   \\(server name) failed

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Netlogon.chg file or the Security Accounts
Manager (SAM) has become corrupt on the BDC.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, reset the Netlogon.chg file by deleting it and
restarting the system. If necessary, also obtain a fresh copy of the Security
Accounts Manager from the PDC.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To delete (reset) Netlogon.chg on an NTFS file system partition from the BDC,
use the following steps:

1. Set the permissions so that the %SystemRoot%\Netlogon.chg file has No Access
   for the System account.

2. Restart the computer, and then delete the file.

3. Restart the computer again. The system recreates the file at startup.

To delete (reset) Netlogon.chg on a file allocation table (FAT) partition, use
the following steps:

1. Start the computer, using MS-DOS, and then delete the
   %SystemRoot%\Netlogon.chg file.

2. Restart the computer, using Windows NT. The system recreates the file at
   startup.
