PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft recommends that you run the Performance Optimizer (Perfwiz.exe) on an
Exchange Server computer after you perform a service pack update.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are generally modifications and improvements to the Performance Optimizer
(Perfwiz.exe) in each service pack.

The Performance Optimizer is a very sophisticated tuning and balancing tool that
you should also use in the following situations:

 - After every new installation of Exchange Server or upgrade of Exchange
   Server, before you put the server into production.

 - After you add components (such as connectors) to a server, including
   directory replication connectors.

 - When the number of users on your server, site, or organization changes
   significantly.

NOTE: Before you run the Performance Optimizer, please make sure to save any
customized registry settings to the Microsoft Exchange Services because
Perfwiz.exe will replace these settings.

After you run Perfwiz.exe, there may be occasions when some or all of these
settings may be imported once again into the registry for additional
optimization of the Exchange server.
