TITLE   :SMS: Scripted Site Server Install Allows Lower Case Site Code
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0,2.0 SP1,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Setup script to install Systems Management Server (SMS), you are
able to specify the site code in lowercase within the script file. This
information is then inserted into the site control file.

Another symptom of this issue is a large quantity of status message "ID=4613"
warnings for the SMS Component Summarizer component.

CAUSE
=====

Not all of the SMS components are case-insensitive.

WORKAROUND
==========

Make sure to use only uppercase when specifying a site code in a scripted site
server installation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Site Component Manager (SMS_COMPONENT_STATUS_SUMMARIZER) expects all
incoming status messages to be in uppercase. When it receives an incoming status
message with the site code in lowercase, all incoming status messages from that
site are deemed invalid, and are placed into the retry queue. Each time it
places a message into the retry queue, it creates another invalid status
message, which restarts the cycle. This causes the disk to start filling up very
quickly, and causes the processor to continue churning indefinitely. This could
impact your newly installed site within minutes or hours depending on how much
available disk space is available.

This problem does not occur in a non-scripted installation of a site server
because the wizard does not accept a lowercase site code.
