TITLE   :Host Name Error in DNS Properties After Changing Computer Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbNetBIOS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive the following error message on a computer whose computer name was
changed to a 15 character name, after making changes on the DNS tab, in the
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) properties:

   The new Internet host name is different than the computer name currently in
   use. Your computer will now be known by one name on your local area network,
   and by another name on the Internet. If the computer name is ever changed it
   will overwrite this new host name and the changes will be lost.

CAUSE
=====

When you edit the DNS properties, the network basic input/output system
(NetBIOS) name is read for the purpose of comparing the Host name against the
NetBIOS name. In this case, the internal NetBIOS name call fails, causing the
NetBIOS name to be viewed as blank, in comparison to the Host name.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the 15 character DNS name is the same as the 15 character NetBIOS (computer)
name, the error message can be ignored. You should be able to click OK to bypass
this message, without experiencing any performance issues, or loss of
functionality.
