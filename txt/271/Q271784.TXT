TITLE   :IBM SDLC Link Service Fails Under Windows 2000
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport sna4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing and configuring a connection to use the IBM SDLC (Synchronous
Data Link Control) Link Service, the connection goes to a pending state then
drops back to an inactive state. The Application Event Log reports an event ID
169, "Description Failed to open device driver \Device\IBMSDLC. Windows NT
rc=c0000034".

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Windows 2000 requires that a driver be installed into and recognized
by the operating system.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the hardware into the operating system using the Add/Remove Hardware
Wizard in Control Panel. The IBM driver is found by selecting X.25/SDLC Adapter
Base 380.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The same device driver problem will occur if you are using Microsoft SNA Server
4.0 because this is an operating system issue, not an application issue and is
not specifically restricted to the IBM driver. Similar problems may occur with
any link service driver.
