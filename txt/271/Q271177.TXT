======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for Access, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.5, 2.5 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Microsoft Access ODBC driver, you can repair or compact a Microsoft
Access database. This functionality is accessable from the ODBC Control Panel,
through the ODBC Microsoft Access Setup dialog box. This repair and compact
functionality works correctly for non-password protected databases. However,
when you attempt to repair or compact password protected databases, the repair
or compact fails with the following error message:

   Not a valid password

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is fixed in the latest service packs for Windows 2000 and MDAC
2.5.

 - To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
   additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

   Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack

 - To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Microsoft Data
   Access Components 2.5. For additional information, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q293312 INFO: How to Obtain the Latest MDAC 2.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

   Date        Version     Size     File name      Platform
   --------------------------------------------------------
   08/29/2000  4.0.5629.0  270,608  Odbcjt32.dll   x86 





WORKAROUND
==========

One workaround is to use the JetComp tool that is included with Microsoft Jet
4.0 Service Pack 4. JetComp is a standalone tool that allows you to repair and
compact a Microsoft Access database, even if Microsoft Access is not installed
on the computer.

Starting with Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) version 2.6, MDAC no longer
contains the following Jet components:

 - Microsoft Jet
 - Microsoft Jet OLE DB Provider
 - ODBC Desktop Database Drivers

   Center

The "MDAC 2.5 Stack and Windows File Protection" white paper contains a full list
of the components that are shipped with MDAC 2.5, along with a discussion of
Windows File Protection. Refer to this white paper for more information about
the Jet dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are included in MDAC 2.5, which are
no longer a part of MDAC 2.6.
