SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create a public information store on an Exchange
Server computer that does not have a public information store object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In some cases, if you use the Microsoft Exchange Server Move Server Wizard to
move a server to a different site, a public information store object may not
exist on the server. If an Exchange Server computer already exists in the site
where you want to move the server, you cannot create a public information store
object on the Exchange Server computer. When you create a new site by using the
Move Server Wizard, if this site is the first Exchange Server computer in a
site, the Move Server Wizard automatically creates a new public information
store on the Exchange Server computer. This behavior is by design.

To create a public information store on an Exchange Server computer that does not
have a public information store object:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.

2. Click the server that you want to create a public information store on.

3. On the File menu, click New, click Other, click Information Store, and then
   click Public Information Store.

4. Quit the Administrator program, and then re-open it to view the new public
   information store.
