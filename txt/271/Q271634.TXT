You must perform the following steps to apply a fix to a cluster server because
SMS Installer fixes are not cluster aware:

1. Use Cluster Administrator to manually stop the Exchange Group on the active
   node.

2. Apply the SMS Installer format fix on the owning node.

3. Move the Exchange Group to the other node.

4. Apply the SMS Installer format fix on the owning node.

5. Move the Exchange Group to the node that you want to run the Exchange Group
   on.

6. Start the Exchange Group in Cluster Administrator.
