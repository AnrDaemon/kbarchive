TITLE   :BUG: ToolTips Do Not Follow Controls on Scrollable Form
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCtrl kbvfp600 kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use ToolTips with a scrollable form under Visual FoxPro 6.0, the
ToolTip positions are based upon their location at form instantiation rather
than the currently visible window.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use the control's StatusBarText property to display ToolTip text in the
status bar at the bottom of the Visual FoxPro window (assuming you have not
turned off the screen).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Paste the following code into a program file:

   PUBLIC loForm

   loForm = NEWOBJECT("frmToolScroll")
   loForm.Show()

   RETURN

   **************************************************
   *-- Form:         form1
   *-- ParentClass:  form
   *-- BaseClass:    form
   *-- Time Stamp:   08/04/00 09:45:06 AM
   *
   DEFINE CLASS frmToolScroll AS form

      Top = 0
      Left = 0
      Height = 259
      Width = 273
      ScrollBars = 3
      ShowTips = .F.
      Caption = "Scrolling Form"
      Name = "frmToolScroll"

      ADD OBJECT cmdAddControls AS commandbutton WITH ;
         Top = 10, ;
         Left = 10, ;
         Height = 31, ;
         Width = 130, ;
         Caption = "Click to add controls", ;
         Name = "cmdAddControls"

      PROCEDURE Load
         *!* some initialization
         WITH ThisForm
            .AutoCenter = .T.
            .ShowTips = .T.
            .Width = 300
            .Height = 300
         ENDwith
      ENDproc

      PROCEDURE cmdAddControls.Click
         *!* lcAddControl can also be replaced with 'commandbutton'
         lcAddControl = 'label'
         lnStartX = 150
         lnStartY = 150
         
         *!* add five controls
         FOR i = 1 TO 5
            *!* calculate new control's name
            lcAddControlName = lcAddControl + LTRIM(STR(i))
            
            *!* add it
            ThisForm.AddObject(lcAddControlName, lcAddControl)
            lcAddControlName = 'ThisForm.' + lcAddControlName
            WITH &lcAddControlName
               .BorderStyle = 1
               .Caption = lcAddControl + LTRIM(STR(i))
               .ToolTipText = .Caption
               
               *!* some added controls will not be visible initially, if
               *!* starting from less than form's width & height
               .Left = lnStartX + i * 50
               .Top = lnStartY + i * 50
               
               *!* show it
               .Visible = .T.
            ENDwith
         ENDfor
         
         ThisForm.Refresh()

         *!* do it only once, or else 'controls already exists' error
         THIS.Enabled = .F.
      ENDproc
   ENDdefine

2. Run the program, and click the Add Controls button.

3. Hover the mouse over the visible labels, and note that the ToolTips appear.

4. Scroll the form, hover the mouse over the controls that are now visible, and
   note that you do not see the ToolTips appear.

5. Hover the mouse over the location where the visible labels were before you
   scrolled them, and note that the ToolTips appear.
