TITLE   :XADM: Event ID 1101 Error 0x8004010f with Background Processing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During a routine background processing, the following event may be logged in the
Application event log:

   Event Source: MSExchangeISPri
   Event ID: 1101
   Description: Error 0x8004010f occurred during background cleanup on message
   <number>

CAUSE
=====

During routine background processing, the content of each mailbox size is
checked against its limit. If a message contains a pointer to an attachment that
is not found in the attachment table, this event is logged. The event may be
logged if you use the ISScan utility to remove certain attachments because the
messages have pointers to the attachments.

RESOLUTION
==========

These events are harmless and disappear when no more messages that contain the
removed attachment exist.

You can use the following command in the ISInteg utility to resolve this
behavior: Exchange Server 5.5:

   "ISINTEG -PRI -FIX -TEST ALLTESTS" (without the quotation marks)

Exchange 2000 Server:

   "Isinteg -s <servername> -fix -test alltests" (without the quotation
   marks)

where <servername> is the netbios name of the Exchange 2000 server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ISInteg utility is a standard utility that is installed with Microsoft
Exchange Server. The ISInteg utility is located in the Exchsrvr\Bin folder.

Additional query words: cleanup clean up extra
