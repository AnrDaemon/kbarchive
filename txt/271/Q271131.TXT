SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to test drive the OLE DB Provider for DB2 feature of
Host Integration Server 2000 by using the demonstration host link services.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps are necessary to test drive the OLE DB Provider for DB2
feature of Host Integration Server 2000 by using the demonstration host link
services:

1. From the Microsoft SNA Manager, add a new DEMO SDLC Link Service, by choosing
   the DB2OLEDB script file.

2. From the Microsoft SNA Manager, right-click the server name and click AS/400
   Wizard on the All Tasks menu. Configure a new connection as follows:

    - SNA Service: (Select server name.)

    - Connection Name: DRDADEMO

    - Link Service: (Select Link Service created in step 1.)

    - Network Name: APPN

    - Control Point Name: DRDADEMO

    - SDLC settings: (Leave as default.)

3. From the Microsoft SNA Manager, right-click the "Local APPC LUs" folder under
   the server name, and then click Local LU on the New menu. Configure the new
   Local LU as follows:

    - LU Alias: LOCAL

    - Network Name: APPN

    - LU Name: LOCAL

4. From the Action menu in Microsoft SNA Manager, click Save Configuration, and
   then start the SNA Service. The newly-created DRDADEMO connection should go
   to On Demand status.

5. From the Run line of the Start menu, type "drda_vb" (without the quotation
   marks), and then click OK to load the ADO Microsoft Visual Basic consumer
   sample application.

   a. Click Connect to use the ADO Connection.Open method. This action
      establishes an APPC session between the OLE DB Provider for DB2 computer
      and the demonstration AS/400.

   b. When you are prompted to use an existing data link file, click Yes. When
      you are prompted to enter the path to the data link file, use the
      following, and then click OK:

   "c:\program files\common files\system\ole db\data links\drdademo.udl"
   (without the quotation marks)

      (This path may vary depending on the system.)

   c. Click Open RS to use the ADO Recordset.Open method.

   d. In the Open dialog box, enter "SELECT * FROM PUBS.AUTHORS" (without the
      quotation marks), and then click OK to continue.

      The recordset is composed of the records in the "AUTHORS" DB2/400 table in
      the DB/400 collection "PUBS", sorted by the first column AU_ID. The sample
      DB/400 data is based on the authors table from the Microsoft SQL Server
      pubs sample database.

   e. Click Next to sequentially access all of the records in the table.

   f. Click Close RS to close the host file by using the ADO Recordset.Close
      method.

   g. Click Disconnect to end the APPC session by using the ADO Connection.Close
      method.

   h. Exit the ADO consumer sample application.

The current off-line script can be used to demonstrate a simple Visual Basic
application, Active Server Page application, or Visual Basic component. It also
works with well-known tools such as RowsetViewer. Unfortunately, the off-line
demonstration script playback capabilities are insufficient to support
demonstrating complex consumers such as SQL Server Data Transformation Services
or Distributed Query Processing.
