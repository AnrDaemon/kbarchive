SUMMARY
=======

Some searches against Indexing Service may fail when you use a language-specific
word breaker; however, you can use the Neutral word breaker to work around this
issue. This "More Information" section of this article explains how to remove
the language-specific word breaker so that the Neutral word breaker is used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To remove all word breakers except for the Neutral word breaker, perform the
following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\ContentIndex\Language

3. Delete all registry keys except Neutral.

4. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\ContentIndex

5. Select the DLLsToRegister registry key and save it to a backup file.

6. Double-click the DLLsToRegister value and remove the line with the
   Infosoft.dll file to prevent re-registering the other languages. Click OK.

7. Quit Registry Editor.

8. Stop, and then restart Indexing Service.

9. Rebuild the catalog by doing a full build.

Please note the following differences that occcur when use only the Neutral word
breaker:

 - In all languages, "advanced" normalization acts differently:

    - Dates: 9/9/99 and 9-9-1999 do not match.

    - Numbers: 1,000 and 1000 do not match.

    - Hyphens: database and data-base do not match.

 - In German, compound decomposition does not work.

 - In other European languages, clitic stripping is lost, which may reduce the
   chances of matching.

 - Word stemming no longer works. Word stemming is when a query on "flew**"
   returns documents matching flew, fly, flown, and so on.
