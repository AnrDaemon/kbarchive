TITLE   :Passwords in Metadirectory Services Cannot Be Reset to Null
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1,2.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, versions 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible to change the password on a metaverse object from the default
value, null, to an actual value using the Entry Administration button on the
Operational tab. When you attempt to set the password value back to null on the
same metaverse object, you may receive the following error message:

   An Authentication error occurred. The password was not changed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because a password cannot be reset to null after it has
been changed from null to an actual value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
