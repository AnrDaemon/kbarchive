TITLE   :DFS Version 4.1 Causes "Failed to Create Volume" Error Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to create a new Distributed File System (DFS) volume on a
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server with the server utility, DFS version 4.1, you
may receive the following error message:

   Failed to create volume \\<servername>\<DFS root>\<new DFS
   volume>\ with network path \\<servername>\<sharename>

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you attempt to create the new DFS volume without
removing the "\" character at the end of the path name, as described in the
following explanation:

When you create a new DFS volume using DFS Administrator you have the option of
manually typing the path to the new DFS volume or using the Browse button to
locate the path in the DFS root directory. If you use the Browse button and
select a subfolder in the DFS root that already exists, DFS Administrator can
insert an additional "\" character at the end of the path.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, you must remove the additional "\" character that DFS
Administrator inserted into the path name.
