TITLE   :XFOR: Excalcon Stops Working When Notes Server Upgraded to 5.02c
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Lotus Notes server is upgraded to version 5.03, the Notes Client that is
located on the Exchange Server 5.5 computer can no longer obtain free and busy
information. The Notes Client user receives the following error message:

   Your schedule request timed out.

A Network Monitor trace shows that no remote procedure call (RPC) packets are
being sent from the Notes Client on the Exchange Server computer.

CAUSE
=====

When you are using the Mail50.ntf file version 5.02c or later, the domain is
appended to the end of the address. This causes the MailLookupAddress function
call not to work. The request is ignored; therefore, no RPC requests are sent
from the Exchange Server computer, and Notes users receive the time-out message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

Return the mail template back to version 5.01a (Mail50.ntf).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 SP3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following new command-line parameters are available when you are running the
Calendar Connector on a Notes server:

   excalcon ... nodomain: The domain is never appended.
   excalcon ... domain: The domain is always appended.
   excalcon ... : If neither parameter is present, the domain is appended on 5.x
   servers and not on 4.x servers.
