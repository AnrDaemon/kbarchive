TITLE   :Require Secure Channel Incorrectly Checked Changing Certificate
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have the Require Secure Channel option enabled for a Web site, and then
change the IP or Port bindings of the associated Certificate in Key Manager,
when you exit Key Manager, the Secure Communications dialog box still shows that
SSL is required to access the resource, even though it is not.

CAUSE
=====

There is no refresh of the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in when you
exit Key Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

To display the status correctly, close and re-open the Web Site Properties
dialog box. The Require Secure Channel check box will then show the correct
status.

After you change the bindings of a Certificate, Microsoft recommends that you
check and configure SSL, and then browse to your site to ensure that SSL is
working correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
