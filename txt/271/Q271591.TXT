TITLE   :XFOR: Virus Scan Software Interferes with Message Delivery
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix kbgraphxlinkcritical

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When third-party antivirus programs that use the Exchange Antivirus API are
running on a server with the Internet Mail Service, messages with large
attachments or compression percentage are directed to the Internet Mail Service
virtual Bad folder. This behavior most frequently occurs when multiple Internet
Mail Service servers exist within the same Exchange Server site.

CAUSE
=====

The ecVirusScanInProgress return code is being checked only once. If Exchange
Server gets the return code again when the information store retries to open the
same attachment, the return code is mapped to Mapi_call_failed, which causes the
Internet Mail Service to move the mail to the Bad folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
