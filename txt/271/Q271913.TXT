TITLE   :XADM: CDO MAPI Session Logon Does Not Work Running As a Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP5fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) are run from a service by using the
account of a user who is not logged on, an attempt to pass a distinguished name
(DN) to the profileinfo string of the logon call may fail and a MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND
error may occur.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if MAPI.Session.Logon fails when it passes a profileinfo
string that contains a DN with invalid file-system characters. Messaging
Application Programming Interface (MAPI) does not create the MMP file for the
profile because MAPI uses the profile name from CDO without checking for invalid
file-system characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

STATUS

version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

Additional query words: CDO.DLL MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND SERVICE
