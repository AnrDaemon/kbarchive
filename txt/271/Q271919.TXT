SYMPTOMS
========

If the Visual Basic Snap-in Designer is used to create a snap-in with ListPads
in the Result Pane, then clicking from one node to another might result in some
error condition. Usually, a blank or frozen result pane is displayed, and then a
run-time error message or access violation is reported when the console in MMC
is closed.

Typically, the error message reads:

   Runtime Error! Program c:\win2000\system32\mmc.exe
   abnormal program termination.


CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a code bug in the mssnapr.dll file.
