TITLE   :Deleting All Users from Container Stops User Deletion from MMS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1,2.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, versions 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the discover process on your computer system and update the
metadirectory, users are not deleted in the metadirectory, even though they have
been deleted from the connected directory.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if all of the users are deleted from the discovered
container, which can cause the intermediate file, Import, to be blank (empty).
When the Import file is blank, the list of users previously deleted in the
connected directory remains in the metadirectory. However, if there is at least
one user listed in the Import files, your instructions to delete specific users
can be sent to the metadirectory for processing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods:

 - You can delete the users manually from the connected directory.

-or-

 - If you are planning to repopulate the container with new users, rerun the
   Management Agent to discover the container and the new users. This procedure
   can populate the Import file and delete the old users.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design to prevent accidental deletions of the entire
connector space.
