Print Preview window and eliminate some of the distortion. However, this may not
help in all cases.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new report. Use any font you desire, but make sure that the report
   contains enough data so that you need to scroll to the bottom of page to see
   it all.

2. Preview the report with Zoom at 100 percent. Scroll to the bottom, and note
   that you can read the report.

3. Scroll back to the top, change the Zoom to 75 percent, and then scroll to the
   bottom of the page. Note that the data at the bottom of the page is
   unreadable. Press one of the keys mentioned in the "Resolution" section and
   the display may improve.
