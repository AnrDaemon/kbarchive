TITLE   :Err Msg: Domain Controller for this Domain Could Not Be Found
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbfile

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to add a Windows NT 4.0 Workstation-based computer to a domain, you
may not be able to add the computer and you may receive the following error
message:

   Domain controller for this domain could not be found

Event Viewer may record event ID 5719 in the System event log:

   No Windows NT Domain Controller is available for domain (domain_name).
   The following error occurred: There are currently no logon servers available
   to service the logon request.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a Lmhosts file is in use, and the Lmhosts file
contains an incorrect entry that is preloaded into the network basic
input/output system (NetBIOS) name cache by using the #PRE extension.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you do not need to use the Lmhosts file, disable the file:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Network.

2. Click Protocols, click TCP/IP Protocol, and then click Properties.

3. Click WINS Address.

4. Click to clear the Enable LMHOSTS Lookup check box.

5. Click OK, and then click Close.

6. Restart your computer when you are prompted to do so.

If your network configuration requires that you use a Lmhosts file for NetBIOS
name resolution, verify that all static mappings in the Lmhosts file are
correct.

NOTE: The Lmhosts.sam file is located in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\Etc
folder.
