TITLE   :Event 5170 Occurs If Backup Server Is Unavailable During Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a backup Host Integration Server (HIS) computer cannot be contacted when the
configuration file is upgraded on the primary HIS computer, the SNA Manage Agent
records event ID 5170 in the Application event log. This warning message
indicates that some registry settings for the Print Server service or the Shared
Folders Gateway service on the backup server may not have been correctly
migrated to the configuration file.

CAUSE
=====

The description for event ID 5170 is as follows:

   The Server Sna2 was not available while the com.cfg configuration was
   migrated. If you had any special registry entries for Print Server or Shared
   Folders Gateway please update the configuration manually.

When the primary Host Integration Server is updated by the Setup program, the
primary server?s Snaadmin.dll file searches for each backup server?s registry
entries. For the Print Server service, the registry key is:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\SnaPrint\Parameters

For the Shared Folders Gateway service, the registry key is:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\SFGW\Parameters

The following SnaPrint registry entries may not have been migrated to the new
Com.cfg file:

   HonorCharsUnder0x40
   FlushFF
   UseProportionalFontFix
   NoSpaceAfterFF
   DelayPrintStart
   DoAllLU3FFs
   BypassGDIForLU3
   DontResetForEveryLU3PrintScreen
   AlwaysDoNL
   SetFixedTabs
   ActivationRetryLimit
   ActivationRetryIntervalBR/>

The following Shared Folders Gateway registry entry may not have been migrated
correctly:

   S36/RemoteLUAlias

RESOLUTION
==========

To manually update these entries, change the Print Server properties for the
appropriate server. You do not need to modify the registry.
