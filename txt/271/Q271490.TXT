SUMMARY
=======

If you use the Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit utility NETSET.EXE to change an
individual computer name and, at the same time, add the computer to a domain,
you will not be able to log into the domain with the new name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You will not receive an error message after you add the appropriate entries to
the unattend.txt file and run NETSET.EXE. However, you will not be able to log
into the domain because the computer joined the domain before the name was
changed.

To work around this, you will need to perform these two operations separately.
The first procedure requires changing the individual computer name and rebooting
the client. You will then need to add the computer to the domain and reboot the
client a second time.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
