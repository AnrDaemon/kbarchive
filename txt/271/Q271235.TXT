======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create an advertisement and configure a scheduled time and an
event-driven setting such as Logon in the Mandatory Assignments window, as
described on page 421 of the Systems Management Server 2.0 Administrators Guide,
the advertisement does not run at the mandatory scheduled time. Instead it runs
as a mandatory advertisement the next time you log on after the time set in the
Advertisement Start Time box.

CAUSE
=====

This procedure is incorrectly documented in the Systems Management Server 2.0
Administrators Guide.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, set the Advertisement Start Time setting for the same
time as the Scheduled Mandatory Time setting.
