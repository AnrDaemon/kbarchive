======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: DEC Alpha 
    - the hardware: Intel x86 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Netscape Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) clients may be unable to
determine the content type of attachments.

The Netscape client cannot determine which application to start to open a
particular attachment. In some situations, the file names of the attachments are
not rendered in the e-mail client correctly. This occurs in Netscape Internet
Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4) clients on computers that are
running either UNIX or Microsoft Windows, and that are downloading e-mail from
an Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 computer. This does not occur in the
Microsoft Outlook Express IMAP client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

NOTE: When you start this version of the information store, the information store
databases are automatically upgraded to a new format. After the databases have
been upgraded, you can restore an earlier version of the Store.exe file on the
server, but only if it is version 5.5.2652.68 or later. If you restore a
Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2652.68 after the database has been
upgraded, you are no longer able to start the information store. For additional
