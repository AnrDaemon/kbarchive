The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A custom event containing an underscore character ( _ ) as part of the event's
name is not received in a Visual Basic event handler. The Visual Basic
integrated development environment (IDE) generates code for the event handler in
the general section of the IDE and not for the object.

CAUSE
=====

This is due to a limitation in the Visual Basic event processing code.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use the underscore character as part of the name of a custom event.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
