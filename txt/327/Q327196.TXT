SUMMARY
=======

Each DLC 802.2 link service that is installed on an SNA Server or Host
Integration Server 2000 system has a unique link service name. The DLC 802.2
link service names are generated by using a base 16 algorithm with a one-digit
index or a two-digit index, as shown in the following list:

     SnaDlc1...SnaDlc9
     SnaDlcA...SnaDlcF
     SnaDlc10...SnaDlc19
     SnaDlc1A...SnaDlc1F
     SnaDlc20...SnaDlc29
     SnaDlc2A...SnaDlc2F
     SnaDlc30...SnaDlc39
     SnaDlc3A...SnaDlc3F
     ...

MORE INFORMATION
================

DLC 802.2 link service names in SNA Server 2.11 are generated by using a base 36
algorithm with a one-digit index or a two-digit index, as shown in the following
list:

     SnaDlc1...SnaDlc9
     SnaDlcA...SnaDlcZ
     SnaDlc10...SnaDlc19
     SnaDlc1A...SnaDlc1Z
     SnaDlc20...SnaDlc29
     SnaDlc2A...SnaDlc2Z
     SnaDlc30...SnaDlc39
     SnaDlc3A...SnaDlc3Z
     ...

The SNA Server 2.11 naming algorithm for the DLC 802.2 link service names is
described in the following Knowledge Base article:

   Q131786 SNA Setup Fails When Installing 33rd DLC 802.2 Link Service

Because the DLC 802.2 link service name algorithm has changed, you may have to
remove, re-add, or reconfigure some DLC 802.2 link services or Distributed Link
Services (DLS) when you upgrade SNA Server systems that have DLC 802.2 link
services and the SNA Server 2.11 link service name format.
