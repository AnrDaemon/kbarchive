TITLE   :Asherons Call: Cannot Connect by Using MSN DSL and Arescom
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Asheron's Call, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to connect to Asheron's Call with MSN Broadband Internet access, you
may not be able to connect.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if either of the following conditions are true:

 - You recently reset your Arescom 800 modem.

 - You recently installed your Arescom 800 modem.

The Arescom modem is designed to look for newer firmware whenever it is reset or
installed. (Firmware is computer code that is inserted into programmable
read-only memory.) The latest Arescom firmware, version 5/20, has problems with
games that use UDP packets, such as Asheron's Call.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, install an earlier version of the firmware. This
resolution means that you will not have the functionality of the latest Arescom
firmware. For more information about the problems that the 5/20 version of the
firmware fixes, see the "More Information" section of this article.

The 5/20 firmware may prevent access to online multiplayer games. If the issues
that fixed in the 5/20 firmware are not as important to you as online games,
install the previous version of the firmware, version 10/24. To do so, follow
these steps:

1. Start Microsoft Internet Explorer, and then visit the following MSN Web site:

https://cpeconfig.dsl.msn.com

2. When you are prompted for your MSN member name and password, type them in the
   appropriate boxes.

3. Click Submit.

The firmware is now installed in the modem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 5/20 firmware fixes the following connectivity and special program issues:

 - Some of the known PPP Down issues.

 - The FTP issue found in previous versions.

 - The Voice & Video MSN Messenger and Microsoft Net Meeting issues
   exception scenario.

MSN and Arescom are working on a newer firmware that will resolve the behavior
and include the fixes in version 5/20. For the most current information, visit
the following Arescom Web site:
