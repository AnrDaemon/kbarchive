MORE INFORMATION
================

CD-ROM: Correction To InheritingSample Code
-------------------------------------------

There is an error in the class3.vb and form1.vb files found on the CD in the
SQLVBNET\Chapter_09\InheritingSample folder.

The change to form1.vb is the addition of one line of code.

Change:

   num1 = 55.5
   MsgBox(c3.TenPercentOfIt(num1).ToString, , _
   	"Return based on a double input")

To:

   num1 = 55.5
   TextBox1.Text = "55.5"
   MsgBox(c3.TenPercentOfIt(num1).ToString, , _
   	"Return based on a double input")

The change to class3.vb is the correction of CDbl to Val in the Return statement

Change:

   Return (CDbl(It) * 0.1)

To:

   Return (Val(It) * 0.1)


Page 324: CDbl Should Be Val
----------------------------

On page 324, at the bottom of the page in the Class3 code sample,

Change:

   Return (CDbl(It) * 0.1)

To:

   Return (Val(It) * 0.1)


Page 325: Missing Statement in Code Sample
------------------------------------------

In the code sample on page 325, a statement is missing.

Change:

   num1 = 55.5
   MsgBox(c3.TenPercentOfIt(num1).ToString, , _
   	"Return based on a double input")

To:

   num1 = 55.5
   TextBox1.Text = "55.5"
   MsgBox(c3.TenPercentOfIt(num1).ToString, , _
   	"Return based on a double input")


Page 338: Missing EndIf Statement
---------------------------------

On page 338, at the center of the page, the required EndIf statement is missing.
This code is correct on the sample CD.

Change:

   	If temp <= 255 Then
   		MsgBox("Sum of " & frm2bytel & " and " & frm2byte2 & _
   		" is " & temp & ".", MsgBoxStyle.OkOnly, _
   		"Result from Form2")

   End Sub

To:

   	If temp <= 255 Then
   		MsgBox("Sum of " & frm2bytel & " and " & frm2byte2 & _
   		" is " & temp & ".", MsgBoxStyle.OkOnly, _
   		"Result from Form2")
   	EndIf
   End Sub
