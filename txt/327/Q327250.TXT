TITLE   :DirectDraw May Not Work After You Install Windows Installer 2.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400nospFix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows Installer 2.0, some programs that use DirectDraw may
not work.

CAUSE
=====

The Msi.dll and Ddraw.dll dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) are configured on
overlapping load addresses. This is typically not a problem because the later
DLL is moved. However, Ddraw.dll cannot work at a moved load address.
