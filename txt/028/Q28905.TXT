SUMMARY
=======

Numbers in the RCDATA section are formatted as documented, with the additional
ability to specify long numbers with an "L" suffix. Strings are enclosed in
double quotation marks ("), and are not null terminated. The following special
mappings are performed:

   Characters  Result      Example
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   ""          "          """Hello "" there"""  ==> "Hello " there"

   "'"         '

   "\\"        \ 

   "\t"        TAB

   \011        TAB

   ^I          TAB

   "\a"        Backspace

   \010        Backspace

   ^H          Backspace

   "\x12"      HEX byte 0x12

   "\123"      OCTAL byte 0123

   "\123"      HEX byte 0x53

NOTE: \" is not allowed. Single backslashes ("\") before any other character are
ignored. Nulls are not allowed anywhere in strings. Rather than using:

   "A string.\0"

use the following:

   "A string.",0

Longs and ints cannot be directly represented inside a string. They must be built
up one byte at a time, or outside any strings.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
