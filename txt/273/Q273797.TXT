SUMMARY
=======

You may notice that User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets are sent from one
Exchange Server computer to another Exchange Server computer or workstation
where the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program is running a link
monitor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can occur in the following scenario:

You install the Administrator program on ServerA, and then configure the
Administrator Program to run a link monitor that you have created. When you
start the monitor, you choose Exchange1 as the server to connect to when
prompted.

When the System Attendant on Exchange1 sends a message to test the link, the
message is returned. When the message is returned and it reaches the System
Attendant mailbox on Exchange1, a new e-mail notification is sent to the client
that is logged (the Administrator program on ServerA). This new mail
notification is sent through UDP.

The amount of UDP traffic corresponds to the number of servers that are monitored
by the link monitor and the polling interval that you set on the link monitor.
