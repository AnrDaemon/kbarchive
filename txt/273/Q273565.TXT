TITLE   :Unexpected Error 0x8007c801 When You Start the FTP Service
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the File Transport Protocol (FTP) service, you may receive the
following error message:

   Internet Service Manager: Unexpected error 0x8007c801 occurred

CAUSE
=====

The behavior can occur if one of the following has occured:

 - The Allow Anonymous Connections check box is not selected and the user name
   for anonymous access is missing.

 - Internet Information Services (IIS) has previously been installed without the
   FTP service, and anonymous access has been disabled from the WWW Service
   Master Properties. When the FTP service is installed later, it cannot start
   because the required AnonymousUserName key is not inherited. The FTP Service
   Master Properties inherits some settings from the WWW Service Master
   Properties, and because anonymous access has been disabled, the anonymous
   user account is not inherited. This causes all new FTP sites to fail with the
   error message above.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Internet Service Manager
   snap-in, open the Internet Information Services (IIS) server snap-in.

2. Right-click the name of the server, and then click Properties.

3. In the Master Properties drop-down list, click FTP Service, and then click
   Edit.

4. Click the Security Accounts tab.

5. Select the Allow Anonymous Connections check box and enter a valid user
   account to use for anonymous access to this resource.

6. Click Apply to apply the settings.

NOTE: If you prefer not to allow anonymous connections, you can clear the Allow
Anonymous Connections check box.
You can now start the FTP site without receiving the error.
