-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Midtown Madness 2, you may receive the following error
message:

   YIKES!
   Midtown Madness 2 was not properly shut down the last time you ran it. This
   may have been caused by several factors, including abruptly turning off your
   computer, or because the game itself stopped responding.

   Try these suggestions to ensure that Midtown Madness 2 runs smoothly:

 - Update your sound and 3D video card drivers to the latest ones available from
   the card or chipset manufacturer's web site. Once you've updated your
   drivers, run the Redetect Video utility (located in the folder where you
   installed Midtown Madness 2), and then start Midtown Madness 2.

   This list includes addresses for the most common video card manufacturer's Web
   sites.

   ASUS http://www.asus.com/
   ATI http://www.atitech.com/
   Creative Labs http://www.soundblaster.com/
   Diamond Multimedia (includes S3) http://www.diamondmm.com/
   Guillemot (includes Hercules) http://www.guillemot.com/
   Intense3D http://www.intense3D.com/
   Matrox http://www.matrox.com/
   NEC PowerVR http://www.videologic.com/
   Number Nine http://www.nine.com/
   Nvidia http://www.Nvidia.com/
   Rendition http://www.rendition.com/
   3DFX (includes STB) http://www.3dfx.com/
   3DLabs http://www.3dlabs.com/
   Trident Microsystems http://www.tridentmicro.com/
   VideoLogic http://www.videologic.com/

   If your video card was pre-installed when you purchased your computer, you may
   need to check with the computer manufacturer for new drivers. Below is a list
   of popular computer manufacturer Web sites.

   Acer http://www.acer.com/
   Compaq http://www.compaq.com/
   Dell http://www.dell.com/
   Gateway http://www.gateway.com/
   Hewlett-Packard http://www.hp.com/
   IBM http://www.ibm.com/
   Packard Bell http://www.packardbell.com/
   Sony http://www.sony.com/
   Toshiba http://www.toshiba.com/

 - Try running the game in Software Only mode. To do so, start Midtown Madness
   2, and then click the Options button in the upper-right corner of any game
   screen. Click Graphics, and then, in the Renderer list, click Software only
   (no 3D video card). When you're finished, click Done to confirm the change.

 - If the game was previously running successfully on your computer before you
   made changes to your audio or video drivers or to your Options settings,
   backing out of those changes may fix the problem. For example, if you
   encountered difficulties with the game after switching to a very high display
   resolution, switching it back to a lower resolution may solve the problem.
   (To change your resolution setting, start Midtown Madness 2, and then click
   the Options button in the upper-right corner of any game screen. Click
   Graphics, and then, in the Resolution list, click the resolution you want.
   When you're finished, click Done to confirm the change.)

 - If you continue to have problems starting Midtown Madness 2, run the Midtown
   2 Safe Mode utility (located in the folder where you installed Midtown
   Madness 2). This will allow you to start the game and make necessary changes
   to Options settings.

   For more information on troubleshooting and optimizing the performance of
   Midtown Madness 2, see the following additional resources:

 - Readme.rtf (located in the folder where you installed Midtown Madness 2).
   This document includes detailed information on troubleshooting problems you

   corner of any game screen), or open the Mm2help.hlp file (located in the
