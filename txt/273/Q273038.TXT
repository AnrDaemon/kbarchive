SUMMARY
=======

Word helps you share documents with people who use different localized versions
of Word. For example, if a colleague who uses the French version sends you a
document electronically, you can edit that document without losing information.
Several features in Word make it easy to work with documents written in any
Eastern, Central, or Western European languages and to create and edit documents
that contain text in more than one language.

Word 97 makes it easy to create and display documents that contain text in a
variety of Pan-European languages. You can also view documents in U.S. Word that
were created in Asian versions of Word.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has created a white paper that describes how to configure your
computer so that you can easily work with multilanguage documents.
