KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200fix kbsms200preSP3 kbsms200preSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you logged on to a network, created some packages, and then expanded the
Packages node in the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Administrator
console, your computer system may take an excessive amount of time to return the
results.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a user with security rights creates many packages.
When this user creates a package, a security instance for the package is also
created. The addition of this extra instance can cause the user's computer
system to decrease the speed at which it can enumerate the packages.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, open the Security Rights node in the Administrator
console and remove all specific Package Instances for the user who created them.
Do not remove the Package (All Instances) Instance for the user, as it can make
packages unavailable to the user.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior may only occur when you are logged on to the same domain where the
packages were created.
