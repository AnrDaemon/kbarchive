   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

User password changes fail are not accepted when using the password change pages
provided under the IISADMPWD subweb in the default Web site.

CAUSE
=====

This problem only occurs if the IISADMPWD subweb is set to use NTLM
authentication, and the client is using Internet Explorer 5.0, 5.01, 5.01 SP1 or
5.5.

Internet Explorer 5.0 has a new feature named NTLM pre-authorization, which
requires NTLM authentication for all visits after you visit one NTLM
authenticated folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make the following registry changes on the client workstation that is using
Internet Explorer.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Run the Registry Editor (Regedit.exe or Regedt32.exe)

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Internet
   Settings/

3. Add the following registry value:

   Value Name: DisableNTLMPreAuth
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: 1
