 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Outlook Web Access (OWA) with Internet Explorer 5.x or an earlier
version of a browser such as Internet Explorer 4.x or Netscape Navigator 4.x,
and you create an appointment that occurs in the past, a warning message that
alerts the user of the error is not displayed. However, when you use an Outlook
client to create an appointment that occurs in the past, a warning message is
displayed.

This issue may enable users to create appointments for past dates and times by
accident.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid creating appointments that occur in the past, verify that you have
entered the correct date and time on the New Appointment form before you save
the appointment.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server.
