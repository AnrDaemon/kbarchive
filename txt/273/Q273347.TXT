TITLE   :Dirsync Server and Remote Requestor Objects Not Removed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove a Microsoft Mail Connector that is configured with a directory
synchronization (dirsync) server and a remote dirsync requestor, the Dirsync
Server and Remote Dirsync Requestor objects may remain in the Connectors tree.
All other Microsoft Mail Connector objects are deleted as expected.

When you delete the Dirsync Server object manually, the following error message
may appear:

   An invalid ADSI pathname was passed.
   ID no : 80005000 Exchange System Manager

When you delete the Remote Dirsync Requestor object, the following error message
may appear:

   The requested operation did not satisfy one or more constraints associated
   with the class of the object.
   LDAP Provider
   ID no : 80072014 Exchange System Manager

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if an Exchange Server administrator created these objects
during Microsoft Mail Connector configuration, instead of their being created
automatically during Setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, delete the objects manually and just click through
the error messages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you need to remove the Microsoft Mail Connector, first delete the Dirsync
Server and Remote Dirsync Requestor objects, and then remove the connector.
