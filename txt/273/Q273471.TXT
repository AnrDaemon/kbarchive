TITLE   :Creating Multiple-Line, Single-Value Attributes in Templates

SUMMARY
=======

When you create a single-value, multiple-line attribute in a construction
template, you must incorporate the c_newline constant into the construction
template.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, assume that there are three variables: $v1, $v2, and $v3. These are
all single-value variables. To combine them into a single-value, multiple-line
attribute, use the c_newline constant. You can then specify the inclusion of a
linefeed in the value:

   $newVar = $v1 $c_newline $v2 $c_newline $v3

As with all variables that are used in a Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS)
template, you must use a preceding "$" character to force the parser to
recognize the constant as a value rather than as a literal string.

You must define the c_newline constant in the management agent's Design MA
action, on the Template Definitions tab. If required, add the following line to
the Template Definitions tab:

   c_newline        code:10

Additional query words: line feed valued lined
