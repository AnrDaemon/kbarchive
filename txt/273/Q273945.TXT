======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) may choose a wrong route when
connections have an address space that is defined using an Organizational Unit 2
(OU2). Messages may bounce, and non-delivery reports (NDRs) may be created.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The fix needs to be installed in all routing calculation servers in the
organization.

For customers that are routing on OUs and that do not upgrade all their routing
ID servers together, the following problems will occur:

 - This present problem will appear on the messages that get routed by the MTAs
   that do not have the fix applied.

 - When one of the servers with the fixed Gateway Address Resolution Table
   (GWART) replicates the GWART over to other servers, the other server without
   the fix generates a different GWART, and replicates its version of the GWART,
   creating a "ping-pong" effect in replication. The servers with the fix and
   the server without will generate a different GWART for the same data and
   connectors, and duel over whose copy of the GWART is correct. The bare
   minimum requirement is that all the routing ID servers be updated together.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
