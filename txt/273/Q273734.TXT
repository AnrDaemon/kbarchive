SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up unattended installation scripts. You can
use unattended installation scripts to install either a primary or secondary
site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you install Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0, ensure that
either Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Service Pack 4, or Microsoft
Windows 2000 Server is installed on the computers that are going to be either
the site servers or the site database servers. Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 or
Microsoft SQL Server 2000 must be installed prior to Systems Management Server
installation remotely or locally.

To perform an unattended installation of SMS 2.0, use the following steps.

NOTE: The following sample script is a general script for an unattended
installation. This script must be modified to suit your specific purpose.

1. Create a user account that you can use as the SMS service account, give the
   account logon privileges as a service right, and then make the account a
   member of the Domain Administrator group.

2. Create an initialization file (Filename.ini) that contains the following
   text. Ensure that you supply your own values for the variables, such as,
   site, domain, and server.

A sample script:

   [Identification]
   Action=<InstallPrimarySite or InstallSecondarySite>

   [Options]
   FullName=<My Full Name>
   OrgName=<YourCompanyName>
   ProductID=<123-4567890>
   SiteCode=<LA1> The site code is a three-character code that SMS uses to
   identify a site.
   SiteName=<My Site> The site name is any text that describes the site.
   SiteDomain=<domain1> The site domain is the Windows NT domain that the
   site server is in.
   ServiceAccount=<SMSService >
   ServiceAccountDomain=<domain1> The domain that the service account is
   in.
   ServiceAccountPassword=<YourPassword>

   PublicKey=
   NumOfClients=<100> The number of clients is the total number of client
   and server computers that are in the current site and all child sites. The
   number of clients is used by Setup to calculate the size of the SMS site
   database device and transaction log device.
   ServerPlatforms=<X86>
   NetworkEnvironments=
   OptionalUnits= <Licensing Metering, Remote Control, Nwbind, Nwnds>
   SMSInstallDir=<D:\SMS>
   InstallSQLServer=<0 0:SQL installation not included>.
   ParentSiteCode=
   ParentSiteServer=
   AddressType= <MS_LAN, MS_ASYNC_RAS, MS_ISDN_RAS, MS_X25_RAS,
   MS_SNA_RAS>
   LanUser= <Domain\User> This specifies the Windows NT account that the
   SMS service on this child site must use to connect to the parent site.
   LanUserPassword=
   RasUser= This field can be omitted if the Address Type is MS_LAN.
   RasUserDomain=
   RasUserPassword=
   RasPhoneBook=
   NumberOfAdminUI=<5>
   SDKServer=<testsms> The server in which you want to place the SMS
   Software Development Kit (SDK) provider. This server can be either the SMS
   site server or the SQL server. In the case of a secondary site installation,
   you do not have to specify a server name.

   [SQLInstallOptions]
   SQLInstallDir=<E:\SmsSQL7>
   SAPassword=
   SQLDevicePath=<E:\Smsdata>

   [SQLConfigOptions]
   SQLServerName=<testsms>
   SQLServerVersion=<7.0>
   UseSQLIntegratedSecurity=<0> (1 for Yes, 0 for No)
   SQLLoginID=<sa> This field can be omitted if UseSQLIntegratedSecurity is
   set to 1.
   SQLLoginPassword= This field can be omitted if UseSQLIntegratedSecurity is set
   to 1.
   CreateSQLDevice=1 If you want SMS Setup to automatically create the devices on
   SQL 6.5 or create the database on SQL 7.0. (1 for Yes, 0 for No)
   DatabaseName=<SMS_sitecode>
   DatabaseDevice=<SMS_sitecode_Data>
   LogDevice=<SMS_sitecode_Log>
   SQLDevicePath=<E:\Smsdata>
   NumberOfSqlConnections=<75>
   AutoConfigSqlConnections=<1>

   [LicenseServer]
   SQLServerName=<testsms>
   SQLServerVersion=<7.0>
   UseSQLIntegratedSecurity=<0>
   SQLLoginID=<sa>
   SQLLoginPassword=
   CreateSQLDevice=<1>
   DatabaseName=<LicDb>
   DatabaseDevice=<LicData>
   LogDevice=<LicLog>
   SQLDevicePath=<E:\Smsdata>

   [Bootstrap]
   SetupPath=
   Action=
   BuildNumber= 1493 for Service Pack 2 (SP2) or Service Pack 3 (SP3)

3. At a command prompt, run SMS 2.0 Setup by using the initialization file that
   you created in step 1 of this article. (The Setup file can be located in the
   SMSsetup\Bin\I386 folder on the SMS CD-ROM.) For example, you can use the
   setup /script filename.ini /nouserinput command.

4. If the unattended Setup is unsuccessful, check the SMSsetup.log on the root
   folder of drive C.
