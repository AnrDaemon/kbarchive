======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cluster Server, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you make changes to the cluster share resource permissions after you
install Cluster Server Service Pack 4 (SP4), your changes may not be saved.

CAUSE
=====

Cluster Server made a change in Cluster Server SP4 to include smbshares. The
NetShareSetInfo function is in Cluster Server SP4, but it does not match with
what happened in earlier versions. For example, in Cluster Server Service Pack 3
(SP3) this function is imported from netapi to check and set the security upon a
change.
