TITLE   :Logging Fails with Event ID 2 "The Data is the Error"
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

There are no corresponding logs in the c:\%Systemroot%\System32\LogFiles
directory for any of the Web services included in Internet Information Server
(IIS) 4.0.

NOTE: The drive letter may be different if Windows NT has been installed on a
different partition.

The following error message is logged in the Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 2
   Source: IISLog
   "The data is the error"

For each Web request from clients, there is a corresponding error message in the
Event Viewer.

CAUSE
=====

By default, IIS uses the user who is currently logged on to write the logs. It
obtains the credentials of the current user from the current thread that is
executing in the Identify.exe process.

When IIS is unable to run under the thread that is currently logged on, it
reverts to the system account. In this case, the underlying NTFS permissions
require the system account to have permissions to the
c:\%Systemroot%\System32\LogFiles folder. The permission needed for the system
account is Full Control.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do the following:

1. In Windows Explorer, open the c:\%Systemroot%\System32\LogFiles folder.

2. Right-Click the LogFiles folder, and then click Properties.

3. Click the Security tab, and then click Permissions.

4. Click Add, and then change the Type of Access for the system account to Full
   Control. Click OK three times.

To verify that the error message no longer occurs, check the
c:\%Systemroot%\System32\LogFiles folder for log files being written.
