TITLE   :XFOR: GroupWise Calendar Connector Event ID 5016
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to view the free-and-busy information of a Novell GroupWise
user, you may receive the following event in the application Event Log:

   Event ID: 5016
   Source: MSExchangeGWiseCal
   Description:
   Could not receive a returning probe message. Please make sure both Microsoft
   Exchange Router for Novell GroupWise service and GroupWise API Gateway are
   running. Probe message checking, Continue.

CAUSE
=====

Although this behavior can point to an incorrectly configured Calendar
Connector, it can also point to an incorrectly configured Microsoft Exchange
Connector for Novell GroupWise.

The Connector for Novell GroupWise requires that you put the API gateway name and
the API gateway domain name as parameters under the Options tab. These two
parameters do not affect the functionality of the connector; all that it needs
to run is the correct API gateway path. So, the API gateway name and the API
gateway domain name can be incorrect, and the Connector for Novell GroupWise
still runs correctly. However, if these two parameters are incorrect, the
Calendar Connector does not work, and the event in the "Symptoms" section is
written to the Event Log.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the Connector for Novell GroupWise to point to the correct API gateway
name and API gateway domain name.
