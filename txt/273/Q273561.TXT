The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure Internet Message Access Protocol 4
(IMAP4) to migrate mail items from Outlook Express to Exchange Server 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot initiate direct migration from Outlook Express to an Exchange Server
mailbox. However, it is possible to migrate existing mail items from Outlook
Express to an Exchange Server mailbox using IMAP4 protocol.

NOTE: For this configuration to be successful, the computer that is running
Exchange Server must have IMAP4 enabled, and it must have access to an SMTP
server (the server does not need to be running Exchange Server).

1. In Outlook Express, create a new mail account for the Exchange Server-based
   computer.

2. Configure this account as an IMAP4 mail account. Use the Exchange Server
   mailbox SMTP address for your e-mail address.

3. Enter the Windows NT domain name and the Windows NT account alias separated
   by a back slash. For example, <domainname>/<username>.

4. Enter your Windows NT account password as the password.

   NOTE: Both the IMAP and SMTP server names are the same name as the Exchange
   Server-based computer. (Technically, an SMTP server is not required for this
   operation, but Outlook Express requires this field to create an account.)

5. Connect Outlook Express to the newly created IMAP4 account and create a new
   folder or use the Inbox folder.

6. Click the mail items from the Outlook Express account(s) that you want to
   move and drag them to the folder in the Exchange Server mailbox. Messages are
   then copied to the Exchange Server mailbox.

You should be able to log on using an Exchange Server client and view the mail
items that you migrated from Outlook Express. The original recipient addresses
and the date and time information are preserved.

This procedure can be applied to any third-party mail client computers that can
use IMAP4.
