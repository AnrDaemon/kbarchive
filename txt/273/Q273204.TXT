TITLE   :SMS: Query-Based Collection Ignores Query If Query Name Typed In
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a collection is based on the results of a query, and if, when you created
the collection, you typed the query name in the Name box instead of by clicking
Browse to locate it, the collection membership will not contain the results of
the query. In fact, the collection will contain the members of the All Systems
Collection group.

CAUSE
=====

In Query Rules Properties, the Name box immediately to the left of the Browse
button is not linked to the Browse button. Actually, when you click Browse, it
imports the query into the collection.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not type in the name of the query for the collection membership. Always click
Browse for the query you wish to use.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
