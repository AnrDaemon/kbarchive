TITLE   :XFOR: RTF Info. Lost from Notes to CR over Internet Mail Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Rich Text Format (RTF) is lost when e-mail messages come from a Lotus Notes
client through the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes under the
following conditions:

 - E-mail messages are sent from Notes to an Internet custom recipient over
   Internet Mail Service.

 - On the Internet Mail Service Properties page, when you click the Internet
   Mail, and then click Advanced Options, the "Send Microsoft Exchange rich text
   formatting" option is set to "User."

 - On the Advanced tab of a given custom recipient's properties, the "Allow rich
   text in messages" check box is selected.

CAUSE
=====

The connector is receiving the RTF handling information from the wrong source.


RESOLUTION
==========

The Exchange Notes Connector has been corrected to release the memory allocated
by the critical section.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

If users do not need to be able to control the RTF handling of their e-mail
messages, you can set the User setting on the Internet Mail Service to Always.
If users do need to control the RTF handling of e-mail messages, there is no
workaround.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4.
