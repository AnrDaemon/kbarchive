TITLE   :PRB: Error When You Copy and Paste GUID in Data View Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbDataview kbGrpDSVBDB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you copy and paste a globally unique identifier (GUID) value from one row
in the grid, which the Data View tool provides, to another row, you may receive
the following error message:

   The value you entered is not consistent with the data type of length of the
   column

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because of a change in the Mdt2qd.dll file, which is one of
the files in the Data View tool. Mdt2qd.dll file versions later than 2.0.0.8456
exhibit this behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use version 2.0.0.8456 or earlier of the
Mdt2qd.dll file. To unregister the current version and register the new version
of Mdt2qd.dll, follow these steps:

1. On the Start menu, click Run, and type the following command to unregister
   the current version of the Mdt2qd.dll file:

   "regsvr32 /u mdt2qd.dll" (without the quotation marks)

2. Rename Mdt2qd.dll (such as "MDT2QD.old" or "MDT2QD.prv").

3. Copy the original Mdt2qd.dll file from the Microsoft Visual Studio Service
   Pack 3 disk.

4. On the Start menu, click Run, and type the following command to register the
   new Mdt2qd.dll:

   "regsvr32 mdt2qd.dll" (without the quotation marks)

5. Restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

NOTE: These steps are based on Microsoft SQL Server.

1. Create a table on an available datasource with a datatype of GUID as follows:

   CREATE TABLE test (Fld1 varchar(20) NULL, MyGuid uniqueidentifier NULL)

2. Insert a row and data into the table as follows:

   INSERT INTO test VALUES ('aaa',NEWID())

3. Start Visual Basic 6.0 or any Microsoft application that uses the Data View
   tools.

4. Create a connection in the Data View tool to the datasource that contains the
   newly created table.

5. Open the table in the Data View window.

6. Copy the GUID value from the row, and paste this value into another row.
