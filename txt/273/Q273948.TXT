PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the Exchange Internet Mail Service is running on a Microsoft Windows
2000-based server, it can not make a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection when
the remote side is another Exchange Internet Mail Service.

CAUSE
=====

The Internet Mail Service is using the IP address of the remote computer instead
of the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). The FQDN is typically the name on the
certificate that must match to make a SSL connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
