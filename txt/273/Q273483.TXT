======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to use the Show method within a WITH...ENDWITH block in a modal
form, issuing a ThisForm.Release() method call does not release the form. In
Visual FoxPro version 6.0, clicking the Close Box in the upper-right corner of
the form closes the form, but does not close the form in Visual FoxPro version 3
or 5.

CAUSE
=====

The form does not release because the WITH command is holding an outstanding
object reference.

RESOLUTION
==========

Issue the Show method of the form outside of the WITH block:

   WITH oForm
      .Caption = "Erin"
      .WindowState = 2
   ENDWITH
   oForm.Show(1)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form class:

   CREATE CLASS frmWith AS form OF withShow.vcx

2. Add a command button to the form with the following code in its Click event,
   and then close the form:

   ThisForm.Release()

3. To show the form, run the following code:

   SET CLASSLIB TO withShow ADDITIVE
   oForm = CREATEOBJECT("frmWith")

   WITH oForm
      .Caption = "Ael"
      .WindowState = 2
      .Show(1)
   ENDWITH

4. Click the command button, and note that the form does not release. In Visual
   FoxPro 6.0, click the Close Box to close the form; in earlier versions, click
   Cancel from the Program menu.
