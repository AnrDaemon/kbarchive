======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Word
version 6.0 for Apple Macintosh to send a document with a routing slip
configured to cross the Microsoft Mail Connection Gateway more than one time,
you will get the following error message:

   Ambiguous address: more than one recipient matches the name or address
   specified.

NOTE: The message will cross the gateway once. However, when the recipient sends
the document on to the next user, the error will appear.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is to select the All the Recipients at Once option or rebuild the
routing slip.

Also, later versions of Microsoft Word have corrected the problem.


Additional query words: 3.20 3.x
