SYMPTOMS
========

The 32-bit ODBC Cursor library (ODBCCR32.DLL) creates temporary files in the
current directory from which the application is launched. The 32-bit cursor
library creates temporary files of the form CTTXXX.TMP in the current directory
of the application. As a result, applications using the cursor library may
encounter errors when they switch the current directory in their application
while cursors are still active.

For example, while closing the application you might see the error message:

   [Microsoft ][ODBC Cursor library] Unable to close file buffer.

32-bit Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) applications that use snapshots fall into
the above class of applications.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. If feasible, close all open cursors and switch the current directory.

2. If you are using File Dialogs, monitor the current directory using the Win32
   API call GetCurrentDirectory() and reset the path using
   SetCurrentDirectory().

   For example:

      main()
      {
       ..
      GetCurrentDirectory(...);
      ...
        /* open cursors  */ 
      ...
        /* open file dialog */ 
      SetCurrentDirectory(..);
        /* close the cursors */ 
      ..
      }
