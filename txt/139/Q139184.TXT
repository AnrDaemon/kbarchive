TITLE   :DOCERR: Picture Property Cannot Be Set to a General Field
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Visual FoxPro documentation incorrectly states that a control's Picture
property can either be set to a bitmap (.bmp) file, an icon (.ico) file, or a
general field in a table. The picture property of a control can only be set to a
bitmap or icon file. If the Picture property is set to a general field, the
image will not appear.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To display an image on a form from a general field, use an OLE Bound control
instead of the image control. Set the ControlSource property of the OLE Bound
Control to the general field. To display a picture on some other type of object
such as a command button, use a bitmap or icon file.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add a table containing a general field to the form's data environment.

3. Add an image control to the form.

4. Select the Picture property in the properties sheet, and click the fx button
   to bring up the expression builder.

5. Select the general field from the fields list, and click OK.

6. Save and run the form. When the form is run, a gray box appears where the
   picture should display.
