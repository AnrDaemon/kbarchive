TITLE   :PRB: ImageEdit Icon Not Created with Workstation Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During a normal installation of Visual FoxPro (Professional edition), Visual
FoxPro creates a program group with eleven icons that includes an icon for
ImageEdit. However, on a computer with a workstation installation, Visual FoxPro
fails to add the ImageEdit icon.

RESOLUTION
==========

To create the ImageEdit Icon after a workstation installation, you must add the
ImageEdit icon manually. To achieve this in Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups,
and Windows NT, select the Visual FoxPro program group in Program Manager, and
add a program item. The new program item's command line must point to the
Imagedit.exe file on the network. In Windows 95, modify the taskbar to include a
shortcut to ImageEdit on the Network.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Perform a Network installation of Visual FoxPro 3.0 (Professional edition) to
   a Network server using the SETUP /A option.

2. Connect to the server from a workstation and run Setup from the Visual FoxPro
   directory.

3. In the Setup dialog box, perform a "Workstation Installation" to the Visual
   FoxPro directory on the local computer.

4. After Setup is complete, note the ImageEdit icon was not added to the Visual
   FoxPro program group.
