TITLE   :SFM Causes STOP 0xA on Multi-Processor DEC Alpha Computers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you configure Services for Macintosh on a DEC Alpha multi-processor
computer and reboot, the computer stops with the following error:

   STOP 0x0000002E.

After you configure Services for Macintosh on a DEC Alpha single-processor
computer and reboot, Services for Macintosh fails to start, but your computer
continues to boot.

CAUSE
=====

You have a network adapter driver supporting loopback installed and the ATalk
protocol driver incorrectly handles loopback AARP packets.

The following are examples of the network drivers supporting loopback packets:

   DE422
   DE200
   DE201
   Microsoft Loopback driver


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Remove the network adapter and restart the computer.

   This causes AppleTalk to fail loading, however, Windows NT starts properly.

2. Log on and install the updated SFMATALK.SYS driver.

3. Shut down Windows NT and turn your computer off.

4. Reinstall the network adapter and reboot.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A fix
to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
