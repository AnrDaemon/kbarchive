TITLE   :International Characters in User Names Not Handled Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add accounts to the Windows NT user database you might lose the display
of user, groups and computer accounts in following applications:

 - User Manager

 - Server Manager

 - File Manager (in ACL editor)

 - Print Manager (in ACL editor)

 - Registry Editor (in ACL editor)

You will still get the account list when using NET USERS or the Resource Kit Tool
ADDUSERS from the command line.

CAUSE
=====

When adding accounts, the special German character (sharp-s) and "ss" are
recognized as being different. But when the accounts should be displayed in the
graphical user interface (GUI) tools, they're treated as equal during sorting
and the action is aborted and no list is displayed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, in the list displayed by NET USERS look for the
users with the almost similar names and delete one of them with NET USER
<USERNAME> /DELETE.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
