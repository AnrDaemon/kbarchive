======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 may be unable to access files stored in cabinet (.cab) files. For
example, when you are trying to install a Windows 95 component using the
Add/Remove Programs tool, the component may not be installed and you may not
receive any error message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if Windows 95 Setup does not create a Layout.inf file
when you originally install Windows 95 from a flat folder of expanded files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Extract the Layout.inf file from the Precopy2.cab cabinet file on the Windows 95
CD-ROM or on Setup Disk 2 to the Windows\Inf folder, and then try to install the
component again.

For information about the Extract tool, type "extract" (without quotation marks)
at a command prompt, or see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Information about cabinet files is stored in the Layout.inf file. Cabinet files
are compressed distribution files containing Windows 95 installation files.
