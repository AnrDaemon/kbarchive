-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, versions 3.11, 3.11a, 3.11b 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows NT Server Tools Network Client Administrator on files
copied to a local hard drive, you receive an error similar to the following:

   The path specified does not contain the network client installation files.
   Verify that the path is correct, then retry the operation.

This error message varies slightly, depending on which option you were selecting
within the Network Client Administrator.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT Server 3.5 "Installation Guide" (Chapter 9, Network Client
Administrator, page 153) states that you can copy these files to your hard
drive, then delete any of the directories you do not intend to use.

However, you must not delete file NCADMIN.INF in the Clients directory, and you
must not rename any of the subdirectories, as these actions will result in the
error specified above.
