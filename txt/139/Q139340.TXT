SUMMARY
=======

During Setup, it is possible to display debug information. This is controlled by
changing the value of the DEBUGOUTPUTCONTROL variable located in either the
INITIAL.INF or SETUP.INF file (depending on the type of Setup used).

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can determine whether or not debug information is displayed by changing the
value of the variable, DEBUGOUTPUTCONTROL. If this variable is set to 1, debug
messages are displayed; if it is set to 0, debug messages are suppressed. There
are two ways to set or clear DEBUGOUTPUTCONTROL.

GUI-MODE SETUP
--------------

GUI-mode Setup is controlled by INITIAL.INF, which contains a [DebugVars]
section. The variable, STF_DISPLAYDEBUGOUTPUT, is defined by the following:

   [DebugVars]
   STF_DISPLAYDEBUGCONTROL = 0

To display debug output, change the 0 to 1. This causes debug messages to be
displayed because in the shell section of INITIAL.INF, the value of
STF_DISPLAYDEBUGCONTROL is assigned to DEBUGOUTPUTCONTROL as follows:

   read-syms DebugVars
   set !DebugOutputControl = $(!STF_DISPLAYDEBUGOUTPUT)

MAINTENANCE-MODE SETUP
----------------------

An acceptable and more direct method is to set DEBUGOUTPUTCONTROL directly.
SETUP.INF contains a statement which sets the value of DEBUGOUTPUTCONTROL. To
display debug information, change the 0 to 1, as shown in the example below:

   set !G:DebugOutputControl = 0

In maintenance Setup mode, this is the only available method because SETUP.INF
controls maintenance-mode Setup (INITIAL.INF is not used) and SETUP.INF does not
have a [DebugVars] section.

NOTE: The use of the "G" prefix sets the value of DEBUGOUTPUTCONTROL in tth
global symbol table in case SETUP.INF is not the top level .INF file.
