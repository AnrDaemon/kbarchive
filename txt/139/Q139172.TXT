TITLE   :PRB: Win32api.hlp & Autodemo Missing from VFP3 Floppy Version
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Neither the Win32api.hlp Help file or the Autodemo program are available on the
Visual FoxPro Professional Edition disks. They are available only on the CD-ROM
compact disc.

CAUSE
=====

Consistent with other Microsoft products, the CD-ROM compact disc version of
Visual FoxPro Professional offers added value to the purchaser in the form of
additional programs or files. In this case, the additional files are the
Win32api.hlp file and the Autodemo program.

RESOLUTION
==========

To get these additional files, you need to purchase the CD-ROM compact disc
version of Visual FoxPro Professional.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Win32api.hlp file is an online reference that documents the various
functions and components of the Win32 API set. As this is only distributed on
the compact disc, you will not be offered the choice of installing this file in
either a first-time or maintenance mode installation when installing Visual
FoxPro Professional from disks.

The Autodemo program, also available on the compact disc, provides guided
demonstrations of many of Microsoft's Developer Tools & Products, including
FORTRAN and Visual C++. Autodemo is not installed from the compact disc unless
explicitly requested.
