-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a program or tool that relies on the real-mode NetBIOS
interface provided by NetBEUI, your network session may be dropped in Windows
for Workgroups 3.11. This problem is most likely to occur with programs or tools
that load a real-mode TSR that interfaces with NetBIOS and have Windows-based
components that communicate with the TSR.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by a number of different timing and optimization
problems that can occur when a Windows-based component uses the protected- mode
NetBIOS interface to communicate with a real- mode TSR running over real-mode
NetBEUI.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disabling the protected-mode NetBEUI component and optimizing the real- mode
NetBEUI protocol may increase the reliability of layered applications based on a
real-mode NetBIOS interface requiring real-mode NetBEUI.

The instructions in the following sections may help you to resolve the problem
described in this article.

Remove Protected-Mode NetBEUI/Use Real-Mode NetBEUI Only
--------------------------------------------------------

1. In the Network group, double-click the Network Setup icon.

2. Click Drivers.

3. Click the network adapter driver, and then click Setup.

4. In the Driver Type box, click Real Mode NDIS Driver, and then click OK until
   you exit Network Setup.

5. When you are prompted to restart your computer, click Continue.

6. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the System.ini file. Locate the
   line that reads

         transport=netbeui.386
       

   and change it to:

   transport=

7. Add the following line to the [Network] section of the file:

   AutoStart=NETBEUI

8. Save and then close the System.ini file.

Optimize the Real-Mode NetBEUI Protocol
---------------------------------------

1. In the Network group, double-click the Network Setup icon.

2. Click Drivers.

3. Click the NetBEUI protocol, and then click Set As Default Protocol.

4. Click Setup, click Sessions, and increase the value to at least 16 (depending
   on your results).

5. Click Set, click NCBS, and increase the value to at least 32 (depending on
   your results).

6. Click Set, and then click OK until you exit Network Setup. When you are
   prompted to restart your computer, click Continue.

Optimize the Virtualized Network Interface
------------------------------------------

1. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the System.ini file.

2. Locate the line that reads

         NetHeapSize=20
       

   and change it to:

   NetHeapSize=32

   NOTE: You can use a value greater than 32, depending on your results.

3. Save and then close the System.ini file

4. Restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The configuration described in this article was tested and is stable with the
original versions of the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 files. This configuration
was not found to be stable with the updated Windows for Workgroups 3.11 files
included on the Microsoft Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 Server CD-ROMs.
