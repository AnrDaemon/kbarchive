SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a collection from Microsoft Scenes version 2.0 installed on your
hard disk, and you run the Oceans Scenes Screensaver Collection, you see random
images from the Scenes collection.

Some of the images may be from the Oceans collection and some may be from the
Scenes collection.

This problem occurs because the Scenes Screen Saver Settings defaults to the
selected Scenes collection.

To resolve the problem, use the following steps:

1. In the opening screen in Oceans, click Options.

2. On the Options menu, click Picture Gallery.

3. On the Picture Gallery menu, click Add To Scenes.

   You receive a message stating that the Oceans Scenes Collection has been
   successfully installed.

4. When asked if you would like to edit your screen saver settings, click Yes.

   Oceans minimizes and the Scenes Screen Saver Settings dialog box appears.

5. Under Collections, click the Oceans collection, and then click OK.

6. Maximize Oceans. In the opening screen, click Options, and then click Screen
   Savers. Click the Oceans Scenes Collection and then click Test.

   The Oceans Collection is now the default screensaver.
