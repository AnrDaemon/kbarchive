======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Automap Streets for Windows, version 4.0 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Street names disappear when you zoom to a location, even though the street names
were visible before zooming.

This occurs on computers running Windows NT, version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Automap Streets
version 4.00. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the Automap Streets Cache size to less than one third the available system
memory.

Changing the Cache Size
-----------------------

1. On the Automap Help menu, click About Automap Streets ....

2. Press and hold down the SHIFT key while you click System Info. The Technical
   Settings dialog box appears.

3. In the Technical Settings dialog box, change the Streets Cache Size setting
   to a number no larger than 1/3 of the Max VM Memory setting. For example, if
   the Max VM Memory setting is 90, the Streets Cache setting shouldn't be
   larger than 30.

4. Click OK to save the settings.
