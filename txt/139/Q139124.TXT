TITLE   :Uplodprf Aborts When Copying CPL.CFG
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You attempt to use UPLODPRF.EXE to preinstall and configure Windows NT on a
large number of Intel-based computers. UPLODPRF.EXE aborts when it attempts to
copy %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\CPL.CFG. The following error then appears:

   The process cannot access the file because it is in use by another process.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, stop the License Logging Service before running
UPLODPRF.EXE.

NOTE: The License Service will not be setup after running WINNTP.EXE from the
Target system.

For more information about the Windows NT 3.51 License Manager, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   nt and license and manager

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The UPLODPRF.EXE file is part of the Windows NT Computer Profile Setup (CPS)
utility. This utility allows you to install the same Windows NT workstation or
Windows NT server configuration on multiple Intel architecture computers.

For more information, see the "Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, volume 1,
Windows NT Resource Guide," Chapter 3, Pages 101-106, Microsoft Press, 1995.
