======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Visual SourceSafe installation is Processor specific. If you install on an
Intel-based system, you get only the executables in the DOS, Win, and Win32
directories for Intel-based operating systems such as Windows, Windows 95,
Windows NT, and MS-DOS. Installing on a MIPS- or Alpha-based system, installs
only MIPS- or ALPHA-based executables in the Ntmips or Ntaxp directories.

Visual SourceSafe 6.0 does not ship with any MIPS or PowerPC executables. The
Alpha Visual SourceSafe executables are only shipped with the Visual Basic
Enterprise Edition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install for more than one processor, you can run a server setup on each of
the workstations running under each processor and direct each installation to
the server. Each setup will add directories to the server install for that
processor. Clients can then have access to the executables for the architecture
they are running.
