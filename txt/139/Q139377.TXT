The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a username of 17 or more characters in the SNA Server Win3.x Banyan
logon dialog box, the dialog box truncates the actual username to 16 characters
and then appends the domain name to the end. This causes the client to fail with
error 546. The user can correct the username once the dialog box appears.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:

   LMCLI.DLL
   IPCLI.DLL
   NWCLI.DLL
   BVCLI.DLL
   WDMOD.DLL
   WLOGTR.DLL
   WNAP.EXE

The fix increases the username field to 32 characters.

STATUS
======

problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
