SYMPTOMS
========

After applying Windows NT 3.1 Service Pack 3, the following STOP message appears
on Compaq Proliant computers:

   STOP: 0xC0000221
   UNKNOWN_HARD_ERROR

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you install Compaq Support Software Diskette (SSD)
updates before you install Windows NT 3.1 Service Pack 3, your computer uses the
4mmdat.sys driver, and you do not reinstall the Compaq SSD update after you
install Windows NT 3.1 Service Pack 3.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one of the following:

 - Gain access to the Windows NT installation from MS-DOS or other means, and
   replace the 4mmdat.sys file with the one from the original distribution
   media.

 - Try using the emergency repair disk (ERD) the you created before you
   installed the service pack.

 - Try to install Windows NT over the existing installation to go back to
   Windows NT 3.1. Then install the service pack and Compaq SSD.

 - Install Windows NT into a new directory to you can run Windows NT and restore
   the old installation from tape.

Compaq recommends that you install SSD 1.05b after you install Windows NT 3.1
Service Pack 3 to avoid this stop message.
