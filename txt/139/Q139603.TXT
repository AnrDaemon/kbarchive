======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, Macintosh Cross-Development Addon, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you compile a project for a Macintosh target, the following error messages
occur:

   C:\MSVC20\MFC\INCLUDE\afxwin.h(1908) : error C2061: syntax error : identifier
   'LPSCROLLINFO'

   C:\MSVC20\MFC\INCLUDE\afxwin.h(1910) : error C2061: syntax error : identifier
   'LPSCROLLINFO'

   C:\MSVC20\MFC\INCLUDE\afxwin1.inl(20) : fatal error C1903: unable to recover
   from previous error(s); stopping compilation

CAUSE
=====

The identifier LPSCROLLINFO is not defined in the Afxwin.h file in version 3.2
of the Microsoft Foundation classes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the provided Setupmfc.exe program, and add a path for the MFC 3.0 include
directory to the INCLUDE environment variable in the development environment.
More details follow.

The Visual C++ 2.2 Setup program installs a program called Setupmfc.exe in the
Msvc20\Bin directory and installs an "MFC 3.0 Source Setup" icon for it in the
Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0 program group. To see the icon, you need to have the
Macintosh add-on installed before you install Visual C++ 2.2. Here are the
necessary steps:

1. Use Setupmfc.exe to reinstall MFC 3.0 source code. Make sure you use the
   Visual C++ 2.0 compact disc when the program asks for the MFC 3.0 source
   directory. Using the Visual C++ 2.2 compact disc will not work.

2. Open the Visual C++ development environment. On the Tools menu, click
   Directories. Under Platform, click Macintosh. Under Show Directories for,
   click Include files. Remove the existing header file directory for MFC 3.2.
   Click the Add button, and add a path for the MFC 3.0 include directory. For
   example:

   C:\Msvc20\Mfc30\Include

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
