IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to remove the program listed at the top of this article using the
Add/Remove Programs tool in the Windows Control Panel, you may receive the
following error message:

   Uninstaller Error! An error occurred while trying to remove Microsoft Music
   Central 96. Uninstallation has been canceled.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if the CD-ROM drive letter has changed since the
original installation of Music Central. For example, this can happen after you
install a second hard disk. In some cases, this can cause your CD-ROM drive
letter to change.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

Change the CD-ROM drive letter to the original drive letter designation, remove
the program listed at the top of this article, and then switch the drive
designation back to the new drive letter.

For information about how to perform this task, contact your hardware
manufacturer.

Method 2
--------

Delete the program's registry items.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.
