SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to create a list box with mover bars that will
update a table. The example creates a two-field table of cities and their
original numeric position in the table. The list box mover bars facilitate
moving the items in the list to a different position and updating the position
number in the table. Mover bars are only available with a RowSourceType of
either 0 (None) or 1 (Value).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following program creates a table and a form with a list box. The list box
has mover bars that can be used to move the items in the list. When the item is
moved, its list number changes as indicated by the grid display.

Code Sample
-----------

   ***START of the MoverBar Program
   *
   * Change the following lines up to the next set of
   * asterisks into comments to prevent creating a new table each
   * time this program is executed.

   SELECT DISTINCT city, 100 ;
   FROM SYS(2004)+"\samples\data\customer" ;
   INTO table MyCity

   REPLACE ALL exp_2 WITH RECNO()
   GO TOP
   ****************
   frmMoverBar = CREATEOBJECT("moverbar")
   frmMoverBar.show

   READ EVENTS
   RELEASE ALL
