SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run Setup for World Atlas, you may receive one of the
following error messages:

   Setup was unable to determine a valid default destination folder. Specify a
   different destination folder.

   There is not enough disk space to complete installation. You can change your
   installation options, contine installation, or exit Setup.

CAUSE
=====

Not enough free disk space is available on the Windows drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

For World Atlas 1996 make at least 7 megabytes (MB) and for World Atlas 1997
make at least 1488 kilobytes (K) of disk space available on the drive where you
installed Windows. Run Setup again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Setup program checks the drive where Windows is installed and determines if
there is sufficient free disk space.

Although the program can be installed onto a drive other than the Windows drive,
World Atlas must have a minimum free disk space on the Windows drive.
