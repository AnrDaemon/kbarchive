The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 2.0 SP1

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Systems Management Server uses SQL Server extensively. Therefore, it
is necessary that you diagnose connection or access problems to SQL Server on a
regular basis. You may also need to manipulate data stored in the SQL Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A common function used to access SQL Server is the ability to log each SQL
command into the existing SMS trace logs. "Select" or "update" statements appear
as they are issued, which may slow down performance. To enable this function:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

      \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Tracing

3. From the Edit menu, select Add Value.

4. Add the following:

         Value Name: SQLEnabled
         Data Type: REG_DWORD
         Data: 1

5. Choose OK and quit Registry Editor.

6. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.

Some SMS service components may need to be restarted for the change to take
effect.

Additional information is also available directly from SQL Server itself. By
running i/SQL and issuing the following, the SQL\LOGS\ERRORLOG.* file(s) will
also be updated with the commands being issued by each application:

      dbcc traceon(-1,4032,3605)

This configuration can be toggled off and on as follows:

      dbcc traceoff(-1)

   -or-

      dbcc traceon(-1)

These settings should not be active for normal use of the system and are intended
for debugging purposes only. Once you obtain output in the respective log files,
they can be used to determine more closely what is happening.
