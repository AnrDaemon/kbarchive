TITLE   :Registry Editor Save Key Saves Key on Wrong Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE), open the registry of a remote
computer, and attempt to save the registry information of a specific key by
choosing Save Key from the Registry menu, the following error message appears:

   Registry Editor could not accomplish the requested operation.

CAUSE
=====

If the remote computer and the local computer have the same directory structure
for the destination directory, the registry key is saved on the remote computer.
This problem also occurs if you typed in a local path. If there's already a file
with this name locally, the local file is deleted.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create a directory with a unique name on the remote
computer and save to that directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
