TITLE   :Windows Printing System Prints Incorrect Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a local Windows Printing System (WPS) printer on a Windows
95-based computer, incorrect characters may be printed at the top of the first
page, followed by several blank pages. Print jobs sent to a remote shared
printer are printed correctly.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 requires that bidirectional communication be enabled when you are
using WPS.

This setting must be enabled even if the port you are printing to is not
bidirectional.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the Windows Printing System icon, and
   then click Properties on the menu that appears.

3. On the Details tab, click Spool Settings.

4. In the Spool Data Format box, click "Enable bidirectional support for this
   printer."

   NOTE: This setting is unavailable if you are using a shared WPS printer on the
   network. You must perform these steps on the computer to which the printer is
   connected.

5. Click OK, and then click OK again.
