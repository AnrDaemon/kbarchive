SYMPTOMS
========

Computer Profile Setup (CPS) does not profile the License Logging Service.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Using UPLODPRF.EXE, upload the Master system. For details on running
   UPLODPRF.EXE read Volume 1, Chapter 3 of the "Windows NT version 3.51
   Resource Kit."

2. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

3. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LicenseService

4. Choose the Save Key option from the Registry menu to save the LicenseService
   Key to a file (for example: A:\LICENSE.TMP).

5. Choose the OK button.

6. Make sure the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE window is highlighted by selecting it.

7. Choose the LOAD HIVE option from the Registry menu to load the registry of
   the Distribution System.

8. In the Load Hive dialog box, specify the filename that was uploaded to the
   distribution server and choose the OK button:
   %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM

9. When prompted for Key Name, specify "Distribution System" (without quotes)
   and choose the OK button.

10. Go to the key: \Distribution System\CurrentControlSet1\Services

11. From the Edit menu, choose Add Key.

12. Specify LicenseService as the key name.

13. Choose the OK button.

14. Go to the following key: \Distribution
   System\CurrentControlSet1\Services\LicenseService

15. Choose the Restore option from the Registry menu and specify the file saved
   in Step 4 above (for example: A:\LICENSE.TMP).

16. Select the Distribution System key.

17. Choose the Unload Hive option from the Registry menu.

18. Run WINNTP.EXE from the target system. For details on WINNTP.EXE, read
   Volume 1, Chapter 3 of the "Windows NT version 3.51 Resource Kit."

NOTE: The License Logging Service only applies to Windows NT Servers. Make sure
the Target system does not violate your Windows NT Server license agreement. You
can verify the licensing configuration from License Manager or from the
Licensing section of Control Panel.
