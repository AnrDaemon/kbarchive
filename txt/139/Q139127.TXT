TITLE   :DOC: Passing GETFILE() a Semicolon Won't Work in Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocfix kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Visual FoxPro Help file entry for GETFILE() states:

   If cFileExtensions contains just a semicolon (;), all files without an
   extension are displayed.

This is not true if Visual FoxPro is running on a computer equipped with Windows
95.

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you issue the following command in the Command window:

      ?GETFILE(;)

the following error occurs:

   Function name is missing ).

If you issue the following command in the Command window:

      ?GETFILE(';')

the Open dialog box lists all files except those with no extension.

However, if you issue the following command in Windows 3.x, Windows for
Workgroups 3.x, or Windows NT 3.5x, the parameter is evaluated to *. and works
as documented:

      ?GETFILE(';')

Additional query words: 5.00 docerr
