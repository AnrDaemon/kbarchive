TITLE   :Using Windows NT To Access Pathworks For VMS (DOS) 4.x Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Pathworks for VMS (DOS) is LAN Manager V1 compliant. Windows NT can be both LAN
Manager V2.2 or V3 compliant. This article explains how you can connect to a
Pathworks for VMS (DOS) 4.x server from Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Both the Windows NT computer and the Pathworks for VMS server must be running
the same protocol (e.g. TCP/IP).

Share names under Windows NT are limited to 12 characters in length and the file
service name must be 12 characters in length or less, if you are going to
connect to a Pathworks file service.

To connect to any file or print service on the Pathworks for VMS Server via the
public account (PCFS$ACCOUNT), go to the Command Prompt on the Windows NT
computer and issue the following connect command:

" net use e: \\server_name\service " (without the quotation marks)

Windows NT is not capable of passing the username to the Pathworks for VMS file
server if you specify it as a qualifier on the command line. For example, the
following command will not work:

" net use e: \\server_name\service /user:user_name * " (without the quotation
marks)

The reason for this is that the Pathworks for DOS client uses a different syntax
in making a connection to a Pathworks for VMS server and expects to see the
username as part of the service name or share name. If you are connecting from
Pathworks for DOS V4.1 client to a Pathworks for VMS server, the command syntax
would have been specified in the following manner:

" net use e: \\server_name\service_name%user_name * " (without the quotation
marks)

Pathworks for VMS (DOS) expects to see the "%USER_NAME" as part of the share or
service name. If you specify your connect command with Windows NT using this
same syntax, it will work provided that the length of the share name plus the
length of the username is less than or equal to 11. The percent sign (% counts
as one additional character. For example, the following connect command from a
Windows NT client to a Pathworks for VMS (DOS) 4.x server will connect you to
the file service pcsav41 as user JOHN (you will be prompted for the user's
password):

" net use e: \\server_name\pcsav41%john * " (without the quotation marks)
