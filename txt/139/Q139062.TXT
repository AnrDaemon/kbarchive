TITLE   :DOCERR: Note in REPLACE Command Documentation Is Misleading
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Note in the REPLACE command documentation describes a limitation that in
fact does not exist in Visual FoxPro. The incorrect note states:

   No replacement occurs if the record pointer is at the end of the file in the
   current work area and you specify a field in another work area.

It is possible to replace a field in another work area if the pointer is at the
end of the file in the current work area by using the REPLACE command with the
IN clause as in this example:

      REPLACE <Fieldname>  WITH  <Varible>  IN  <TableAlias >

MORE INFORMATION
================

The REPLACE command will not work if the pointer is at the end of the file in
the table where the replacement is supposed to occur no matter where the pointer
is in the current table.

Sample Code
-----------

Run the following code from the Visual FoxPro Command window.

   SET DEFAULT TO C:\VFP\SAMPLES\DATA
   OPEN DATA testdata
   USE products  IN 0
   GO TOP       && Move record pointer to the first record
   USE customer IN 0
   SELECT customer
   GO BOTTOM
   SKIP         && Now the current work area(customer) is at EOF
   REPLACE Eng_name WITH  "John Doe" IN products

Browse the products table, and note that Eng_name has been changed to John Doe
contrary to what the documentation says.
