SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to play a sound clip on MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may receive
the following error message:

   Navigator not found

CAUSE
=====

You may receive the error message stated above if any one of the following
conditions exists:

 - You are trying to play an incorrectly authored sound clip.

 - You are trying to play a sound clip when MSN is very busy.

 - You are trying to play a sound clip on a computer with mixed beta and release
   version DLL files. You may have installed the released version of MSN over a
   beta version, which may have left you with a mix of beta and release version
   DLL files.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the sound clip was incorrectly authored, we can fix it.

If MSN is very busy when you try to play a sound clip, the only solution is to
try to play the sound clip later.

If you installed the released version of MSN over a beta version, perform a clean
install of MSN. If the clean install does not solve the problem, call MSN Member
Support with the following information:

 - Which sound clip were you trying to play?

 - Where is the sound clip located on MSN?

 - What was the time and date when you tried to play the sound clip?
