TITLE   :FIX: Initialization Var Shadow_SetTime Set to Invalid Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400bug kbSSafe500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The error "Initialization variable Shadow_SetTime set to invalid value" occurs
when a user checks a file in to Visual SourceSafe or adds a file to Visual
SourceSafe.

CAUSE
=====

The Visual SourceSafe Administrator gives administrators the ability to shadow
projects. The shadow option has several flags that tell SourceSafe how to
operate on the files. One of the options is the date/time flag known as the
Shadow_SetTime .ini file variable. The valid options in the Administrator are
Current, Modification, or Update. The valid .ini file settings are Current, Mod,
and Update respectively. The Visual SourceSafe Administrator improperly wrote
the modification setting as:

   Shadow_SetTime = Modification

RESOLUTION
==========

The administrator should manually modify the Srcsafe.ini file. Modify the
Shadow_SetTime setting as follows:

   Shadow_SetTime = Mod

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual SourceSafe 5.0.
