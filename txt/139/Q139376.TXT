The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SNA Server does not support Printer LU Pools because it would be impossible
to predict where a user's host print output would be sent. If users each
print to their own printer LU, the SNA Server administrator will need to
define an SNA Server user record for each user and assign them the specific
display and printer LU.

Note that the printer LU where a user's host print job is routed depends on
the user configuration at the host end, not in SNA Server.

NOTE: SNA Server 3.0 implements the use of an Associated Printer LU. This
feature allows an Administrator to associate a specific 3270 printer LU
with a 3270 Printer LU. The [ASCII 147]Pool contains Associated Printers[ASCII 148] option in
the General tab of the 3270 Pool Properties is intended for users whose
host ap
lications have direct relationships between display LUs and printer LUs. If
this option is selected, all display LUs will be treated as though they
have an associated printer.
