SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to manually configure an ESS488 sound card in Device Manager, you
may not be able to configure the card to use IRQ 10, even though you have
configured the card itself to use IRQ 10.

CAUSE
=====

Many ESS488 sound cards have been modified so that you can use IRQ 7, but not
IRQ 10. The documentation included with the sound card may not reflect that this
modification has been made.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, configure the card to use IRQ 7 instead of IRQ 10.
If IRQ 7 is not available, configure the card to use IRQ 3 or 5, or reconfigure
other devices in your computer so that IRQ 7 is available. The card can also be
configured for IRQ 2, but this is not recommended because IRQ 2 is used by the
Peripheral Interrupt Controller (PIC).
