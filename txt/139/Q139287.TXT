TITLE   :Canon Printer Cannot Print Mixed Orientations to FILE: Port
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a Canon printer and you print a multiple-orientation document
to the FILE: port, some of the fonts in the document may not be printed when you
print the output file.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a problem in the firmware of some Canon printers. The
following printers are known to exhibit this behavior:

 - Canon LBP-4

 - Canon LBP-4U

 - Canon LBP-4 Lite

 - Canon LBP-4 Plus

 - Canon LBP-8 III

 - Canon LBP-8 III Plus

 - Canon LBP-8 IIIR

 - Canon LBP-8 IIIT

 - Canon LBP-8 IV


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use either of the following methods:

 - Enable the Print TrueType As Graphics option. To do so, follow these steps:

   1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

   2. Use the right mouse button to click the printer you are using, and then
      click Properties on the menu that appears.

   3. On the Fonts tab, click the Use TrueType As Graphics option, and then
      click OK.

 - Do not use multiple orientations in one document. Print each section of a
   multiple-orientation document as a separate document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs only with documents printed to the FILE: port that contain
multiple orientations and more than one TrueType font.

For additional information about these printers, please contact Canon Technical
Support.
