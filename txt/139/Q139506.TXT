TITLE   :Connections to Share-Level Server May Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible for multiple logon sessions to be in progress simultaneously from
a single workstation to a single server. For example, the interactive logon user
may initiate an interactive logon session and a service may initiate another
session. These logon sessions are multiplexed over a single virtual circuit
(VC.)

When such connections are established to a share-level server such as Windows 95
or LAN Manager running share-level security, the session may be terminated
unexpectedly when one of the users log off.

Applications may receive one of the following error messages:

   An unexpected network error occurred

   System error 59 has occurred

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT redirector incorrectly sends a logoff&X Server Message Block
(SMB) to the share-level server when other sessions exist.
