-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51

SUMMARY
=======

The SilentRip registry entry used with RIP for Internet Protocol, can be a
useful tool in environments with multiple routers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following registry key is added when you install Rip for Internet Protocol
on a Windows NT Server version 3.51:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\IpRip\Parameters
   SilentRip REG_DWORD
   Valid entries: 0, 1

When you install RIP for Internet Protocol on a single-homed server running
Windows NT Server 3.51, SilentRip is set to 1. This allows the Server to accept,
but not send, RIP Broadcasts to other RIP compliant routers. This is useful in
that the server always maintains the quickest route to a location in a WAN
environment, and is able to use different routes in case a router fails.

When you install RIP for Internet Protocol on a multihomed Windows NT server,
SilentRip is set to 0. This allows the Windows NT server to listen for and send
RIP packets on the network.
