TITLE   :How to Make Combo or List Boxes Hold More than 255 Characters

SUMMARY
=======

When you use a list or combo box that has Value as the RowSourceType, only 255
characters can be typed into the RowSource property. You should use the Value
option in the RowSourceType property when you need to place static values in the
list or combo box. When you choose the Value option, the values can be typed
into the RowSource property separated by commas. Once 255 characters have been
typed into the RowSource property, no more characters are allowed, so the
computer's bell sounds when you try to add another character. If the list or
combo box needs to hold more than 255 characters, create an array to hold the
values as demonstrated by the example in this article.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a form in Visual FoxPro.

2. On the Form menu, click New Property. In the Name box, type:

      listarray(5)

3. In the Load event, type:

      THISFORM.LISTARRAY(1)="Choice1"
      THISFORM.LISTARRAY(2)="Choice2"
      THISFORM.LISTARRAY(3)="Choice3"
      THISFORM.LISTARRAY(4)="Choice4"
      THISFORM.LISTARRAY(5)="Choice5"

4. Select a list or combo box from the Controls toolbar, and place it on the
   form.

5. Choose the RowSourceType property of the list or combobox in the Properties
   Sheet, and select the Array option.

6. In the RowSource property, type:

      thisform.listarray

7. In the NumberOfElements property, type:

      =ALEN(thisform.listarray)

8. Run the form, and note that the list or combo box contains the elements of
   the array.

This is a small example demonstrating the kind of elements an array might hold.
The only limitation is that the array can hold a maximum of 65000 elements.
