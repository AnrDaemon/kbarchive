SYMPTOMS
========

Moving the mouse to a corner of the screen may activate the screen saver in
Windows 95. This may occur even if the specific screen saver you are using does
not have a "hot corner" enabled or does not have a "hot corner" feature.

CAUSE
=====

The screen savers included with Microsoft Plus! have "hot corner" settings that
remain active even if you are not using the screen saver in which you enabled
the "hot corner" setting.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable or disable the "hot corner" settings, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Display icon.

2. Click the Screen Saver tab.

3. In the Screen Saver box, click any Microsoft Plus! screen saver, and then
   click Settings.

4. On the General tab, enable or disable the "hot corner" feature by clicking
   each corner, and then clicking Default, Now, or Never on the menu that
   appears.

5. Click OK, and then click OK.

The "hot corner" settings you choose apply to all the Microsoft Plus! screen
savers, as well as to other screen savers in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you uninstall the Desktop Themes component of Microsoft Plus!, you may not be
able to disable the screen saver "hot corners." To disable the "hot corners,"
reinstall the Desktop Themes component, and then follow the steps in the
"Resolution" section above.
