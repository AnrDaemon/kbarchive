TITLE   :How to Add Fields to a Table in Visual FoxPro Programmatically
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In previous versions of FoxPro, the only way to alter the structure of a table
programmatically was to create a new table that contained the new structure and
then append the data from the old table.

Visual FoxPro now includes the ALTER TABLE command, which allows you to alter the
structure of an existing table programmatically. This article shows by example
how to add a field to an existing table.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This example uses the Customer.dbf table that is part of the Testdata.dbc
database. These files are located in the \Vfp\Samples\Data directory. The
following code adds a new field named Newfield to the Customer.dbf table. The
new field is a character field with a width of 20.

      OPEN DATA testdata
      USE customer
      ALTER TABLE customer ADD COLUMN Newfield C(20)

After running this code, use the MODIFY STRUCTURE or BROWSE command to see the
changes to the table structure.

For more information on the ALTER TABLE command, please see the ALTER TABLE
command topic in the Visual FoxPro Help file.
