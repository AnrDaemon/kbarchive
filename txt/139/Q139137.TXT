SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to the Internet, you may receive the following error message:

   Unable to create folder. Some features may not work properly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the registry value for Internet Explorer's
Cache_Directory or History_Directory is missing or invalid.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

To correct the problem described in this article, follow these steps:

1. Check the Cache_Directory value under the following registry key:

   HKEY_Local_Machine\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main

   The default value is:

   C:\Program Files\Plus!\Microsoft Internet\cache

   If the value contains a path, the folder that the path points to is missing.
   Create this folder.

2. If the path is missing, enter a valid path for the registry value.

3. Repeat steps 1-2 for the History_Directory value. The default value is:

   C:\Program Files\Plus!\Microsoft Internet\history
