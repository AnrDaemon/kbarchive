TITLE   :Long File Names Not Displayed During Compression
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the mini-Windows portion of Windows 95 is running while you compress a
drive, the file names listed as being compressed use the standard 8.3 file name
format, not the Windows 95 long file name format.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When mini-Windows is running, only standard 8.3 file names are recognized. It
may appear that long file names are being damaged by the compression routine, as
some of the file names are not recognizable. However, the compression routine
does not damage the long file names; it merely displays the 8.3 versions of the
long file names.

If you compress a drive and mini-Windows is not required, files are displayed
using the long file names.
