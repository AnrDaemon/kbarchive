-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 1.0, 1.05, 1.2, 1.3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to send an E-form or reply by mail from a bulletin board (BBS), you
may receive one of the following error messages:

   Bad Recipient Type

   MAPI_E_FAILURE

   Cannot find GroupWise

CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur if you have installed Novell GroupWise. GroupWise
overwrites the Mapi.dll file (dated 7/11/95) in the Windows\System folder with
an older version of the file, and renames the original Mapi.dll file to
Mapi.!ll.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, remove the older Mapi.dll file in the
Windows\System folder, and then rename the Mapi.!ll file to Mapi.dll.
