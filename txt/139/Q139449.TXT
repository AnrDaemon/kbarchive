SUMMARY
=======

This article provides specific instructions, through an example, on how to
create and assign each new user a Home Directory in a Windows NT domain. That
is, each user will connect to a share that contains only their files and
directories and nothing else.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the following example, the user ID is referred to as HomeUser and the server
where the home directories reside is referred to as \\HomeSrv.

1. Create a directory and share on the server:

   a. On \\HomeSrv, create a directory called HomeUser. This directory can be in
      any location on the server hard drive, but user home directories are
      typically created under the C:\Users directory.

   b. Share the HomeUser directory as HOMEUSER. Each user subdirectory must be
      shared separately.

2. Create the user ID:

   a. From User Manager for Domains, choose New User from the User menu.

   b. Enter a valid user name, description, and password. For the example, the
      username is HomeUser.

   c. Click Profile.

   d. In the Home Directory box, click the option button next to Connect and
      choose a drive letter. This drive letter will be used only by Windows NT
      clients. For this example, choose H.

   e. In the To box, enter the UNC path where this user's home directory will
      reside. For example, \\HomeSrv\%username%.

3. Secure the \\HomeSrv\HomeUser share so only HomeUser has access to it.

   a. Run File Manager, select C:\Users\HomeUser, and choose Share As from the
      Disk menu.

   b. Click Permissions and then click Add.

   c. Select the HomeUser name and click Add.

   d. Set the type of access that this user should have to the share. Because
      this is the user's home directory, they should either have Full Control or
      Change access to the share.

   e. Click OK.

   f. Click Everyone and then click Remove.

4. Create a logon script if needed.

   If this user will be logging on from different clients (Windows NT, Windows
   95, or Windows for Workgroups) then assign a logon script that issues a NET
   USE H: /HOME command. On Windows NT, the command will simply fail because the
   home directory has already been assigned. On the other clients it will
   connect drive H: to the \\HomeSrv\HomeUser share.

   For more information on creating and assigning logon scripts, see the Windows
   NT documentation and the Knowledge Base.
