SUMMARY
=======

When you use a Sony ATAPI CD-ROM drive on a standard IDE adapter, you may have
to configure the Sony drive as the master drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sony has found that there can be timing problems if a SONY ATAPI CD-ROM drive is
connected to a standard inexpensive IDE adapter with many hard drives. They
suggest configuring all models of SONY ATAPI drives connected to standard IDE
adapters as master drives, which avoids the timing issues.

EIDE adapters do not have the same timing issues, so the SONY ATAPI CD-ROM can be
used as Master or Slave with those adapters.
