The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft does not currently offer a 32-bit ODBC Btrieve Driver. The only
version of the Btrieve driver available from Microsoft is in 16-bit format. The
latest released version of this driver is marked version 2.00.2317 and was part
of the ODBC Desktop Database Drivers 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The paper insert that is included in the Office 95 box, marked with the part
number 62150 on the bottom left corner of the fourth page and entitled
"Microsoft Office for Windows 95 Professional Edition - Supplemental Offers,"
includes a section called "32-bit ODBC Desktop Drivers Kit 3.0 (Application
Note)." This insert incorrectly states that a 32-bit Btrieve driver is part of
this application note. However, there is no such driver available with the ODBC
3.0 versions of the ODBC Desktop Database Drivers. Furthermore, because the
release of these ODBC 3.0 drivers is 32-bit only, there is also no 16-bit ODBC
3.0 Btrieve driver included with this set of drivers.

If you are interested in a 32-bit ODBC Btrieve driver, contact Btrieve
Technologies at (800) 287-4383.
