-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf '95 for Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Copy To Excel command in Bookshelf does not work if there is a cell being
edited in Excel.

When you click Copy To Excel on the Bookshelf Edit menu, you are returned to
Excel and the Copy to Excel dialog box is not displayed, and the copy operation
is not completed.


CAUSE
=====

When the Copy To Excel command is selected in Bookshelf, Excel is in native mode
(called a modal state). In this mode, Excel does not realize Bookshelf has
requested integration services to copy data into a cell. The Paste portion of
the command is not completed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Select an empty cell in Excel, but do not try to edit the cell contents.

When you use the Copy to Excel command in Bookshelf, you are returned to Excel
and the Copy to Excel dialog box is displayed.
