SUMMARY
=======

It can be useful to track the amount of time that was spent in a Visual FoxPro
application. By using the timer control in Visual FoxPro, you can create a timer
to track elapsed time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code creates a form that begins tracking the elapsed time when it
is launched. It displays the total time in a WAIT WINDOW when the form is
closed.

      PUBLIC ostopwatch

      oStopWatch=CreateObject('stopwatch')
      ostopwatch.Visible=.T.

      DEFINE CLASS stopwatch AS form
         AutoCenter = .T.
         Top = 32
         Left = 9
         Height = 137
         Width = 293
         DoCreate = .T.
         Caption = ""
         etime = 0
         Name = "Form1"

         ADD OBJECT command1 AS commandbutton WITH ;
           Top = 48, ;
           Left = 84, ;
           Height = 49, ;
           Width = 133, ;
           Caption = "Quit", ;
           Name = "Command1"

         ADD OBJECT timer1 AS timer WITH ;
           Top = 12, ;
           Left = 12, ;
           Height = 23, ;
           Width = 23, ;
           Interval = 1000, ;
           Name = "Timer1"

         PROCEDURE Unload
           WAIT WINDOW 'Elapsed Time = '+ALLTRIM(STR(ThisForm.etime))+ ;
              ' Seconds'
         ENDPROC

         PROCEDURE command1.Click
           THISFORM.Release
         ENDPROC

         PROCEDURE timer1.Timer
           THIS.Parent.etime=This.Parent.etime+1
           THIS.Parent.Caption='Elapsed Time ='+ ;
               ALLTRIM(STR(This.Parent.etime))+' Seconds'
         ENDPROC

      ENDDEFINE
