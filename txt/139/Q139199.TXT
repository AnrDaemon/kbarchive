TITLE   :PRB: Mastering Visual FoxPro CD Gives Choppy Video Performance
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mastering Series
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbmm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Mastering Microsoft Visual FoxPro 3.0, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When playing videos in Mastering Microsoft Visual FoxPro, you may experience
choppy videos.

CAUSE
=====

The choppy video playback is usually the result of a slow transfer rate from the
CD-ROM drive. This can be caused by one of the following three factors.

 - There may be a terminate-and-stay resident (TSR) program or disk-caching
   program that is slowing the transfer rate from the drive. Remove unnecessary
   TSRs from your Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files and from the LOAD= and RUN=
   lines in your Win.ini file.

 - The CD-ROM drive may not be Multimedia PC (MPC) compliant and may not meet
   the transfer rate requirement. Upgrading to an MPC-compatible CD-ROM drive
   will eliminate this problem.

 - A lack of available memory (RAM) can cause choppy playback. Adding additional
   RAM speeds up the playback.

RESOLUTION
==========

Identify and eliminate the cause of the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
