OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400bug kbSSafe500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive the error "No application associated with this file type" when
trying to view a file that contains more than one period in the file name.

CAUSE
=====

Visual SourceSafe parses the file name from left to right. This means that a
file called My.file.doc is parsed so that the extension appears to be .file.doc
and there is no association for this file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename the file from My.file.doc to My_file.doc in the Visual SourceSafe
Explorer (on the File menu, click Rename).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual SourceSafe 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Rename a file that is associated with an application so that the file name
   contains more than one period.

2. Add the file to Visual SourceSafe.

3. Double-click the file from the Visual SourceSafe Explorer. At this point, The
   error message "No application associated with this file type" appears.
