TITLE   :FIX:Open Dialog Box Appears After Clicking Next in Wizard Form
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

As you run a form that was created by using the Form Wizard, the Open dialog box
appears when you click a navigation button such as the Next button. If the table
used in the form is selected, the following error appears:

   File is in use.

This occurs if SET COMPATIBLE is set to DB4.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use any of the following three workarounds:

Workaround One
--------------

This workaround sets the default Compatibility of Visual FoxPro to OFF.

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the General tab.

3. Clear the dBASE Compatibility check box.

Workaround Two
--------------

This workaround sets the Compatibility OFF until Visual FoxPro is restarted. In a
program or in the Command window, issue the following line of code:

      SET COMPATIBLE OFF

Workaround Three
----------------

This is a permanent solution. Wizard-created forms will function correctly
regardless of the setting of SET COMPATIBILITY.

1. Open the txtbtns class of the Wizstyle.vcx class library file. (This library
   is in the Wizards directory of Visual FoxPro.)

2. In the Initvars procedure, change the following existing line of code:

         THIS.nWorkarea = SELECT()

   to the following new line of code:

         THIS.nWorkarea = SELECT(0)

3. Save the class.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SET COMPATIBLE DB4 changes the behavior of the Initvars procedure. With the SET
COMPATIBLE OFF setting, SELECT() returns the currently selected work area.
However, with the SET COMPATIBLE DB4 setting, SELECT() returns the next
available work area.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form by using the Form Wizard.

2. Issue a SET COMPATIBLE DB4 command.

3. Run the form.

4. Click the Next button.
