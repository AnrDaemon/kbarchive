SYMPTOMS
========

When the Find What field in the Replace dialog box is set to "^" (the Beginning
of Line symbol), The characters in the Replace with field are not inserted at
the beginning of blank lines.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can record a macro to help work around this problem. Record a macro by on
the Tools menu, clicking Record Keystrokes. Move to the beginning of the line by
pressing the HOME key. Then enter the characters you want, and press the DOWN
ARROW key to move to the next line. Then press the HOME key again, and stop the
recording. To run the macro, position the insertion point on the starting line.
Then press and hold down CRTL+SHIFT+P until all the insertions are made.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.
