TITLE   :GetVersionExA Error in SMS 1.1 Network Monitor for WFW
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:smsnetmon kbNetworkMon

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After installing the Network Monitor for Windows for Workgroups from the Systems
Management Server 1.1 CD-ROM and running it, the following error message
appears:

   Win32s - Error, the procedure entry point "GetVersionExA" could not be
   located in the Dynamic Link Library "KERNEL32.dll"

CAUSE
=====

The new call, GetVersionExA, that was implemented in Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 is
not serviced due to incompatible WIN32S .DLLs that come with the Network Monitor
Installation Disks located in the NMEXT directory on the Systems Management
Server 1.1 CD-ROM.

WORKAROUND
==========

Install the older WIN32S .DLLs that support GetVersionExA (dated 7/11/95) after
you have installed the Network Monitor Version from the CD-ROM.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. We will post new information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
