TITLE   :IPX Type 0x14 Packets Propagated Even if Disabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

IPX Type 0x14 packets are propagated even if you disable forwarding of IPX Type
0x14 packets in the registry by setting the Internet entry to 0.


CAUSE
=====

Browser announcements over an IPX host link are broadcast because the browser
requests a 0x14 packet type. Setting Internet under the NWLNKNB registry key to
0 only affects the NetBIOS broadcasts.

RESOLUTION
==========

You cannot prevent this symptom because the software design purposely causes
this to happen.

Even if the Internet entry in the registry is set to 0 (use packet type 0x04),
Windows NT propagates a few type 0x14 frames.

However, to disable all type 0x14 broadcasts you must disable the binding for
IPX/SPX compatible transport under the server service. This will make many
Registry modifications, so if this needs to be automated SYSDIFF.EXE will
capture all these differences and allow you to apply them on many machines.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Internet registry key under the subtree HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE under the
following subkey controls the forwarding of IPX Type 0x04 and 0x14 packets:

   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\NWLNKNB\parameters

Value Name: Internet
Data: 1 or 0
Default: 1 (1 means forward IPX Type 0x14 [decimal 20] packets)

The 0x14 packet type matches Novell WAN broadcast message type.

Type 0x04 specifies forwarding of IPX packets; routers do not forward them.
Type 0x14 is a Novell Wan Broadcast Packet; routers do forward them.
