PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you stop an SNA Server that is connected through Twinax to an IBM 5494 or
5394 Controller (that is connected to an AS/400) and then restart the server,
the server fails with the following STOP message:

   STOP:0x00000050

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Twinax driver support is not handling the startup sequence
properly when connecting through an IBM 5394 or 5494, which differs slightly
from the native startup to an AS/400.

When the SNA Server Twinax link service starts, a Memory Descriptor List (MDL)
entry that is passed from User Mode to Kernel Mode is corrupt, hence the
bugcheck is called displaying the STOP:0x00000050.


RESOLUTION
==========

When you stop the SNA Server service, reboot the server before restarting the
service.

Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:

   IBMTDLC.SYS
   ANDWTDLC.SYS
   SNATDLC.DLL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
