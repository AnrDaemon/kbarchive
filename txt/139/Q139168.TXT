TITLE   :FoxPro Hangs Accessing Database on Macintosh Volume
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to write large amount of information to a FoxPro database stored
on a Macintosh volume in Windows NT Server, the following occurs on the client
computer:

 - FoxPro application stops responding (hangs).

 - Access to the FoxPro database is not available.

CAUSE
=====

Resource forks are generated as data is written to the FoxPro database on the
Macintosh volume. Each time data is written to the database, Windows NT blocks
access to the Macintosh volume in order to enumerate the changes for Macintosh
users. If many workstations attempt to write to the database at the same time,
FoxPro times out internally. Network Keepalive traffic is generated and the
workstations stay connected to the server. However, access to the database is
interrupted for a significant period of time.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest US Service Pack for Windows NT. For
