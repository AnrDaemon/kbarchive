This article describes how to delete a control from a column in a grid.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

The default control in a grid column is a text box. If you drop a control on a
grid column, both controls exist in the grid column. The following steps show
how to delete the text box:

1. Create a new form.

2. Place a grid on the form.

3. Set the grid's ColumnCount to 2. (The columns will display.)

4. Right-click the grid, and then click Edit.

5. Click the check box button on the Forms Controls toolbar.

6. Click column 1 of the grid to drop the check box in that grid column.

7. Click the down arrow on the Object list box of the Properties Sheet, and note
   there are two controls (Text1 and Check1) under Column1.

8. To delete Text1, select Text1 from the list. Then click the Form Designer's
   title bar to make it active, and press the DELETE key.
