TITLE   :XCLN: Closing Client by Double-Clicking the System Menu
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you close Microsoft Exchange by double-clicking the System menu or by
choosing the Close command on the System menu, it is similar to choosing the
Exit command from the File menu rather than the Exit And Log Off command.

As a result, the Microsoft Exchange Windows client closes, but the messaging
application programming interface (MAPI) connection is left open.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. It prevents you from having to close all other messaging
applications (for example, Schedule+ version 7.0) when the Microsoft Exchange
window is closed.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you use a Microsoft Exchange Client Extension, it is possible to change the
default behavior to allow the Microsoft Exchange client to Exit And Log Off when
it is closed using the System Menu. The extension would need to watch for the
close menu being called and then exit and log off.

Please refer to the MAPI Software Development Kit (SDK) for more information on
how to create Microsoft Exchange Client Extensions.
