The information in this article applies to:

 - The Integrated Debugger, included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


When MSVCMON is run in a Win32s system, you will not see the TCP/IP protocol as
an option for connection. The TCP/IP communication layer for MSVCMON is written
for true 32-bit platforms and requires multi-threading support to operate.
Because of this, the remote debug monitor (MSVCMON) does not support TCP/IP on
Win32s. It only supports a serial connection for remote debugging. This
information should be added to your Visual C++ 4.x documentation.
