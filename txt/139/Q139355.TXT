    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When building Win32 applications which use the SNA Server APPC Management Verb
functions (DISPLAY and CNOS), the verb control block passed to the SNA Server
interface does not have the correct non-packed structure.

CAUSE
=====

The WINMGT.H file is missing the proper packing statements.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, add these lines to the WINMGT.H include file.

At the beginning of these header files, these statements should be added:

      #ifdef WIN32

      #pragma pack(4)

      #endif

At the end of these header files, these statements should be added:

      #ifdef WIN32

      #pragma pack()

      #endif


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
