ENCARTA 96 ENCYCLOPEDIA MANUAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------

If you encounter difficulties in setting up Encarta Encyclopedia on Windows 3.1x
with the SETUP program, you will still be able to fully install and use Encarta
Encyclopedia by using a manual installation and MANUAL96.BAT, a batch file that
will copy files from the CD to your hard disk.

Once the copying is completed, it may be necessary to run Setup.exe from the CD
as specified in the Encarta 96 Encyclopedia installation instructions.

Running MANUAL96.BAT
--------------------

It is recommended that you exit Windows before running MANUAL96.BAT to prevent
possible difficulties with replacement of some system files.

The MANUAL96.BAT file is located in the x:\AAMSSTP\MANUAL directory of your
Encarta Encyclopedia CD (where 'x' is the drive corresponding to your CD-ROM
drive). The CD-ROM drive will be referred to as [source] later in these
instructions.

To run MANUAL96.BAT, change to the x:\AAMSSTP\MANUAL directory and type the
following at the MS-DOS prompt:

   "MANUAL96 [windows dir] [dest]" (without the quotation marks)

where [windows dir] is the path to your Windows directory (usually C:\WINDOWS)

[dest] is the path and directory to which you want to install Encarta
Encyclopedia (usually C:\Encarta)

For example:

   MANUAL96 C:\WINDOWS C:\ENCARTA

installs Encarta 96 Encyclopedia to your C drive in the ENCARTA directory and
tells the batch file that Windows is located on your C drive in the WINDOWS
directory.

Important: Running Setup.exe
----------------------------

If you have not previously run Setup.exe from the Encarta 96 Encyclopedia disk,
you should do so after running the MANUAL96.BAT file.

Once the above instructions have been completed, Encarta will be successfully
installed.
