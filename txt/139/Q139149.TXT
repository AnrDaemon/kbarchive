TITLE   :PPT7: Troubleshooting Video Driver UMA Conflicts
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0

KEYWORDS:kbenv kbgraphic

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your system may stop responding when you open or view a presentation containing
imported graphics.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by the expanded memory manager scanning too aggressively
and setting up upper memory blocks (UMBs) that conflict with the video adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To troubleshoot this problem, try the following:

1. Open your Config.sys file.

2. Locate the line similar to:

   device=emm386.exe noems

   Add the following to the end of this line:

   "x=a000-c7ff" (without the quotation marks)

   This line should now be similar to:

   device=emm386.exe noems x=a000-c7ff

3. Save the file and restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 uses the MS-DOS expanded memory emulation driver, Emm386.exe, to
provide expanded memory services (EMS) for MS-DOS applications that need it. If
you load Emm386.exe with an x=<range> parameter, Windows 95 doesn't try to
put an EMS pageframe in that range of memory addresses.

A standard VGA card requires memory ranges A000-AFFF and B800-BFFF. Some VESA
Local Bus and PCI cards use the entire range A000-C7FF.
