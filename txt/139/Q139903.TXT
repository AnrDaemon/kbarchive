-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The "Windows NT Resource Guide," Volume 1, page 607 states that the
registry value AddOns is type Boolean. The correct type is REG_SZ. The
value of AddOns is a comma-separated list containing the names of the DLL
add-ons to File Manager. This error appears in the online help file and the
printed documentation included in the Windows NT Resource Kit version 3.5.
This error was corrected in the online help file, but was not the printed
documentation, for the Windows NT Resource Kit version 3.51.

The corrected text should read:

   Registry path:

      HKEY_CURRENT_USER
       \Software
         \Microsoft
           \File Manager
             \Settings

   AddOns     REG_SZ

   Range: Comma-delimited list
   Default: (none)

Additional query words: prodnt
