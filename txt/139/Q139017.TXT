KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to record a .wav file from an audio CD using the Compaq ESS ES688
integrated sound chip, the sound from the CD may stop playing while the
recording is in progress. The sound does not return until you stop recording.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Monitor While Recording option is not turned on
in the Mixer tool. By default, this option is turned off with the Compaq ESS
ES688 AudioDrive.

RESOLUTION
==========

Turn on the Monitor While Recording option in the Mixer tool. To do so, follow
these steps:

1. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the System.ini file. Verify
   that the line "drivers=msmixmgr.dll" exists in the [boot] section of the
   file. If the line does not exist, add it, save the file, and then restart
   your computer.

2. Start the Mixer tool by double-clicking the speaker icon on the taskbar.

3. On the Options menu, click Properties.

4. Click the Recording option, and verify that there is a check mark in the
   Recording Controls check box. If there is no check mark, click the Recording
   Controls check box to select it. Click OK.

5. On the Options menu, click Advanced Controls to display the advanced
   controls.

6. Click the Advanced button.

7. In the Other Controls section, click the Monitor While Recording check box to
   select it. Click OK.
