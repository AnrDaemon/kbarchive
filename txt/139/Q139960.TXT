TITLE   :Limiting LAN Traffic to One Network Adapter

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Often, systems running SNA Server have more than one network adapter. A network
administrator may want to limit traffic on the LAN adapter. For example, non-DLC
traffic on an adapter that is configured for the 802.2 link service.

This can be accomplished by disabling selected bindings on the network adapter
that provides the upstream connection to the host system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The example below assumes two network adapters, one ethernet and one Token Ring.
The ethernet adapter is configured for NetBIOS over TCP/IP and the Token Ring
adapter is configured for DLC, NetBEUI, IPX/SPX and NetBIOS over TCP/IP.

The objective is to limit LAN traffic on the upstream DLC connection to the host
by disabling selected bindings on the Token Ring adapter. The steps necessary to
perform this operation are outlined below:

1. Show Bindings for All Components in the Network Bindings Dialog Box.

2. Disable the following bindings:

      NetBIOS Interface --> WINS Client (TCP/IP) -->
      IBM Token Ring Adapter Driver --> (2) IBM Token Ring 4/16 Adapter

      NetBIOS Interface --> NetBEUI Protocol  -->
      IBM Token Ring Adapter Driver --> (2) IBM Token Ring 4/16 Adapter

      Server --> WINS Client (TCP/IP) --> IBM Token Ring Adapter Driver -->
      (2) IBM Token 4/16 Adapter

      Server -->  NetBEUI Protocol --> IBM Token Ring Adapter Driver -->
      (2) IBM Token Ring 4/16 Adapter

      Workstation --> WINS Client (TCP/IP) -->
      IBM Token Ring Adapter Driver --> (2) IBM TokenRing 4/16 Adapter

      Workstation --> NetBEUI Protocol -->
      IBM Token Ring Adapter Driver --> (2) IBM Token Ring 4/16 Adapter

      NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible Transport -->
      IBM Token Ring Adapter Driver --> (2) IBM TokenRing 4/16 Adapter

3. Accept changes and restart the server.

NOTE: It is not necessary to disable SNA Server Link service or DLC transport
bindings because the SNA Server DLC 802.2 link service only communicates over
the adapter specified during SNA Server Setup. There is no traffic generated by
the SNA Server link service over the unused DLC card binding.
