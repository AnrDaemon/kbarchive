SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Office for Windows 95 has an option called WordMail that allows
Microsoft Exchange 32-bit Windows clients to use Microsoft Word as the default
e-mail editor. If WordMail is installed, by default Word becomes the e-mail
editor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you install WordMail, the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client will open
Microsoft Word instead of the standard Microsoft Exchange send form when you
click the New Message command on the Compose menu or the New Message button on
the toolbar.


To return to the standard Microsoft Exchange send form, click the WordMail
Options command on the Compose menu. Clear the Enable Word as E-mail Editor
check box.
