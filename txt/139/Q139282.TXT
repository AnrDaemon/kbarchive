TITLE   :New 3C509 Addressing Scheme Requires New Remoteboot Config
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The new 3COM 3C509 adapter has a new addressing scheme that requires you create
a new remoteboot configuration. The older 3C509 adapters have a
VendorName=00608C, and the newer 3C509 adapters have a VendorName=0020AF. If you
try to boot the newer adapter with the old configuration, the following error
message appears:

   unknown client network adapter id

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, create a new remoteboot configuration as outlined in
the Windows NT Server Installation Guide on pages 139-140. Follow the documented
steps and add the new 6-digit prefix 0020AF to the VendorName parameter.
