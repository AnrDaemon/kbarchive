SYMPTOMS

When you are using a real-mode network client, such as the Novell VLM or NETX
network client, or the Banyan Vines real-mode network client, the screen may
turn black and leave the pointer flashing in the upper-left corner when you
attempt to quit Windows. After several minutes, you may receive the following
error message:

This problem occurs independent of the type of computer and network interface
card you are using and independent of the real-mode network client you are
using.
