-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Help file for Visual FoxPro has an incorrect code example for the SET KEY
command. The RANGE clause is omitted, and the SET ORDER TO command refers to a
field that does not exist in the Customer table in the Testdata database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following is the incorrect code example for the SET KEY command:

      CLOSE DATABASES
      USE customer
      SET ORDER TO zip
      SET KEY TO '43000', '43999'

This code example returns an error because there is no Zip field in the Customer
table. If the Zip field did exist, the only records visible would be those with
a value of 43000 in the Zip field. This is because there is no RANGE clause in
the SET KEY command.

Following is the corrected code example:

      CLOSE DATABASES
      USE C:\VFP\SAMPLES\DATA\Testdata!Customer
      INDEX ON postalcode TAG postalcode
      SET ORDER TO postalcode
      SET KEY TO RANGE '40000', '43999'
      BROWSE

Using this code, you will see records that have values between 40000 and 43999 in
the Postalcode field.
