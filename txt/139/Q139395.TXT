SYMPTOMS

The first time sound is used in your multimedia program the sound plays as
expected. However, when you exit and then restart Windows you experience sound
problems. This also occurs when you reinstall the program.

In a program supporting sound, audio may not work, or you may receive one of the
error messages when you attempt to play sound:

   No wave device exists that can play files in the current format.

-or-

   Undetectable problem in the specified device driver.

-or-

   Multimedia device failed.

   Integer divide by zero.

CAUSE
=====

Duplicate Audio Compression Manager (MSACM) files or System.ini files exist on
the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: The following steps involve searching for, deleting, and renaming files
and folders. For more information about how to accomplish these tasks in
Windows, see your Windows printed documentation or online help.

To remove the duplicate files, do the following:

1. Search your hard drive for the following files:

   - Msacm.drv
   - Msacm.dll
   - Msadpcm.acm

   Only one copy of these files should reside on your computer. Rename or delete
   any copies not found in the Windows\System folder.

2. Search your hard drive for the following file:

   - System.ini

   Only one copy of these files should reside on your computer. Rename or delete
   any copies not found in the Windows folder.
