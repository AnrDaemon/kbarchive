PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbvfp kbvfp300bBUGkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the RUN command to shell to MS-DOS results in an ICE (Internal Consistency
Error). This occurs when Visual FoxPro is running on a computer that has the
following characteristics:

 - The computer uses a 16-bit operating system, such as Microsoft Windows or
   Microsoft Windows for Workgroups.

 - The computer uses Win32s to provide the Win32s API to Visual FoxPro.

 - The computer uses Novell Netware 3.11 MS-DOS network drivers.

CAUSE
=====

The precise cause of this problem has not been determined, but the problem
appears to be related to a conflict between Win32s and the Novell 3.11
requestor.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to version 3.12 or higher of the Novell requestor or upgrade to a 32-bit
operating system such as Windows 95 or Windows NT that does not require Win32s.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
