SUMMARY
=======

The TextOut() function under Hebrew and Arabic versions of Windows 3.1 and
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 is different from the TextOut() function under the
U.S. version. The Arabic and Hebrew version of TextOut() has additional layout
and shaping features to support bidirectional text. Arabic and Hebrew text is
rearraged for right-to-left reading before being displayed.

The RawTextOut() function, which is an API available only in the Hebrew and
Arabic versions of Windows version 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups version 3.11,
is identical to the U.S. version of TextOut().

RawTextOut() should be used if the string must be displayed exactly as it is
specified without being shaped and rearranged to fit the Hebrew and Arabic
right-to-left reading order.

Additional query words: 3.10 ME Middle East string layout
