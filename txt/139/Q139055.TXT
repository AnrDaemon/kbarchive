TITLE   :Problem Changing Computer Name Without Changing DNS Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On your computer running Windows NT, if you install TCP/IP and allow it to use
your computer name, by default, as Domain Name System (DNS) host name and you
decide to change the computer name afterwards, the following symptoms occur when
you issue the PING.EXE and IPCONFIG.EXE /ALL commands:

 - Even though no other computer uses the old computer name, you can still ping
   the old as well as the new computer name by using the following syntax:

   PING <computer_name>

 - The IPCONFIG /ALL command still displays a name that matches your old
   computer name.

 - If another computer running Windows NT or another operating system (with
   TCP/IP installed) has your old computer name as a computer name or DNS host
   name and you try to ping the other computer by name, ping still returns the
   IP address of your computer instead of the other computer.

CAUSE
=====

When you ping by name, Windows NT responds if either the computer name or the
DNS host name match the name being pinged.

IPCONFIG /ALL displays the DNS host name, not the computer name, and the host
name has not changed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To cause PING.EXE and IPCONFIG /ALL to display names that match your computer
name, change your DNS host name to your new computer name.

To change your DNS host name:

1. Run Control Panel and choose Network.

2. Select the TCP/IP Protocol from the list of Installed Network Software and
   choose Configure.

3. Choose DNS and edit the Host Name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It may be appropriate in your environment to have a DNS host name that is
different from your computer name. Windows NT TCP/IP does not require that the
computer name and host name match.
