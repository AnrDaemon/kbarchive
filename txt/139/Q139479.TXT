PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot kbVC500 kbVC600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to uninstall Visual C++ by using Control Panel, choosing Add/Remove
Programs, and selecting Visual C++, Windows 95 displays a message box containing
the following lines:

   

   Uninstaller Error
      An error occurred when trying to remove Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0.
      Uninstallation has been canceled.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 displays this message when it cannot run the uninstall command for
the product you are trying to remove. With Visual C++, it means that it cannot
find Vcremove.exe, or otherwise is not able to run it. Vcremove.exe is the
program that uninstalls Visual C++. It is installed by the setup program into
the top-level directory of your Visual C++ installation, which by default is
Msdev. It may be that the file was accidentally deleted or corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy Vcremove.exe from the Msdev directory on the Visual C++ compact disc to the
top-level directory of your Visual C++ installation. Then use Control Panel to
remove the product.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
