======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Mail Gateway to X.400 cannot process outbound messages with invalid X.400
address attributes. As a result, it will produce the following error(s):

   09:31:55 Extracting message from local message store: 00005726
   09:31:55 DEBUG (converting PC mail message to X.400): Translating to X400
   09:31:56 ERROR 3 (creating P1 recipient address): Malformed address:
   type<16>/c=US/a=ATTMail/p=GOV/o=hq/ou=WP4/dt=WPMail/dv=USER.BOB
   09:31:56 ERROR 3 (creating X.400 message envelope (P1)): No Recipients Found

   09:31:56 ERROR 3 (converting PC mail message to X.400): Creating P1
   09:31:56 ERROR 3 (converting PC mail message to X.400): local form to X400

In the above example, dt= and dv= are invalid attributes for dda.type= and
dda.value=.

CAUSE
=====

Often addresses that have invalid attributes are placed in the X.400 gateway
address list by importing an address list (text file) file from a foreign mail
system.

In the above example, Novell's Groupwise was the foreign mail system that
provided the text file with dt= and dv= for dda.type= and dda.value=.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a text editor and search for invalid addresses attributes and replace them
with the corrected attributes. Then remove the invalid addresses from the
gateway X.400 address list and import the corrected text file.

MORE INFORMATION
================
