STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA
for Windows NT version 3.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The communication rate used by the modem to establish a connection to the remote
modem is logged based on entries in the modem script. This rate normally appears
as a connection statement, where the baud rate appears after the word CONNECT,
for example,

   >>>CONNECT 28,800<<<

NOTE: The connection rate is the more accurate rate when determining the rate of
information exchange between the External Mail program and the Remote External
or one of Remote Mail programs.

The baud statement is used in the modem script to dictate the baud rate of the
COM port to a specified value. The baud rate entry is recorded after the modem
has been initialized by the External Mail program. The Baud Rate entry in the
SESSION.LOG of the External Mail program is used to display the connection rate
established by the External program between the serial port and the local
modem.

The baud rate entry can be located in the COMM settings section of the modem
initialization in the SESSION.LOG.

For example,

   Initializing Modem:
   Line Speed : 57600
   OUT: [AT&F?]
   IN: [??OK??]
   OUT: [AT&C1&D2E0L0M1V0X3&K3W2?]
   IN: [AT&C1&D2E0L0M1V0X3&K3W2?0?]
   OUT: [ATS0-0S7=45S9=6S10=50S12=50?]
   IN: [0?]
   COMM settings:
   Comm. Port: Com1
   Baud Rate: Touch Tone
   Dial Mode: Touch Tone
   Script File: <Script Name>
   Initialization complete. Ready.

The only valid baud rates that the External Mail program can use to set the
serial port for communications with the modem are 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600,
19200, 38400, and 57600.
