The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT Server as a backup domain controller (BDC) or set up
a Windows NT Workstation to join a domain using a Network Peripherals NP-EISA/S
FDDI network adapter, the following error message appears:

   Could not find domain controller for this domain.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when a primary domain controller (PDC) and BDC are connected
using a Cabletron hub using the TCP/IP protocol.

RESOLUTION
==========

Network Peripherals has a newer driver (Npeisa.sys) for this adapter that fixes
this problem. The latest driver file can be obtained from the Network
Peripherals bulletin board system (BBS) at (408) 321-9322.
