TITLE   :FIX: Can't Select First Table When Creating DAO Table Recordse
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbDAOsearch kbDatabase kbMFC kbVC kbVC410fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using AppWizard or ClassWizard to create a table-type recordset
derived from CDaoRecordset, you will not be able to successfully select the
first table in the list of tables presented. Attempting to do so will result in
a dialog box bearing the following message:

   You must select one table for this table-type recordset.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, follow this procedure:

1. Instead of selecting a Table recordset type in the wizard, use Dynaset.

2. Edit the implementation (.cpp) file of the resulting recordset and search for
   the member variable m_nDefaultType. Change the type of recordset by modifying
   the value that is assigned to that member.

   Change this:

        m_nDefaultType = dbOpenDynaset;

   To this:

        m_nDefaultType = dbOpenTable;

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 4.1.
