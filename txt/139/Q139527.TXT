can be created easily.

The following program creates a table called newtable that has 200 fields, each
defined as a character field of size 20:

      lnTblstr="("
      FOR lnI=1 to 200
        lnTblstr=lnTblstr+"FLD"+ALLTRIM(STR(lnI))+" C(20),"
      ENDFOR
      lnTblstr=STUFF(lnTblstr,LEN(lnTblstr),1,")")
      CREATE TABLE newtable FREE &lnTblstr
