======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Following is the description that the Visual FoxPro documentation gives for the
DocumentFile Property:

   Returns the name of the file from which an embedded or linked object was
   created.

This is incorrect. Only the linked objects return the name of an object; embedded
objects return " ".

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Demonstrate Behavior
-----------------------------

1. Type the following line of code in the Command window:

      MODIFY FORM test

2. Place an OLE Container control on the form.

3. On the Insert Object dialog box, click Create From File, and select
   C:\Windows\Bubbles.bmp to create an embedded file. (You can use any .doc file
   as well.)

4. Place a second OLE Container control on the form, and insert a file as you
   did in step 3. This time, create a linked Object using the same graphic file
   (for example, C:\Windows\Bubbles.bmp) by selecting the Link check box in the
   Insert Object dialog box. (You can use any .doc file as well.)

5. Type the following lines of code in the Debug window:

      test.olecontrol1.documentfile
      test.olecontrol2.documentfile

For the expression, "test.olecontrol1.documentfile" (the embedded file), you
receive "". For the expression, "test.olecontrol2.documentfile" (the linked
file), you receive C:\Windows\Bubbles.bmp.
