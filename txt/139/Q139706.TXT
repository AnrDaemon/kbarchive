MORE INFORMATION
================

The files included in this bug-fix release update those that shipped in Windows
95. They include bug fixes and provide users running Microsoft Exchange with
Windows 95 access to their Microsoft Mail shared folders. The Microsoft Mail
information service that ships with Windows 95 does not provide access to shared
folders.

IMPORTANT Before following this procedure, exit and log off Microsoft Exchange.

To update files:

1. From Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

2. Click the Windows Setup tab.

3. Click the Have Disk button.

4. Type the path to the directory containing this file.

5. Select the Microsoft Exchange check box.

6. Click Install. This installs the necessary files and makes the necessary
   changes to MAPISVC.INF.

7. From Control Panel, double-click Mail And Fax.

8. Remove the Microsoft Mail information service from your profile by selecting
   it from the list and choosing Remove.

9. Add the Microsoft Mail information service by choosing Add, then choosing
   Microsoft Mail from the list of services that you can add. The Microsoft Mail
   configuration pages appear.

10. On the Connection page, type the path to your Microsoft Mail postoffice in
   the Edit box. If you were previously using Microsoft Mail, the path will be
   entered for you. Click the Logon tab.

11. Type your mailbox and password in the appropriate boxes. If you were
   previously using Microsoft Mail, the names will be entered for you. Select
   the When Logging On, Automatically Enter Password check box.

12. Click OK to add the service, then click OK again to save the changes to your
   profile. The next time you run Microsoft Exchange, you will see Microsoft
   Mail Shared Folders in the folder list of the Viewer.
