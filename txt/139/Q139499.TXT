TITLE   :TN3270 Server Doesn't Dynamically Recognize LUA LU Config Change
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If LUA LUs are added or removed using SNA Server Admin, the TN3270 Server
configuration utility must be re-run to recognize these changes. The TN3270
server does not dynamically adjust to LUA LU configuration changes.


MORE INFORMATION
================

TN3270 Server does not update the number of sessions available (Sessions=)
dynamically. To update TN3270 Server after you add/delete LUs to SNA Server,
choose Config from the TN3270 Administrator. You are prompted by a dialog box
stating "SNA Server configuration has been changed since last update." This
dialog box is displayed when the number of LUs has changed for an SNA resource
after the resource has been configured for TN3270 Service. The conflicting
values are displayed. By choosing the default entry, you allow TN3270 Service to
resolve the conflict. Otherwise enter the correct value for your environment.
