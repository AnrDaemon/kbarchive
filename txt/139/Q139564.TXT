SUMMARY
=======

The AutoFormat feature in Word works behind the scenes to produce an attractive,
easy-to-read document while you concentrate on the content. Word analyzes each
paragraph to see how it's used in the document (for example, as a heading or as
an item in a numbered list) and then applies an appropriate style for that item.
Word also automatically formats Internet, network, and e-mail addresses as
hyperlinks; applies bold or underline character formatting to text surrounded by
asterisks or underscores; replaces two hyphens with an em dash; and so on.

AutoFormat works in these ways:

 - Word automatically formats headings, bulleted and numbered lists, borders,
   numbers, symbols, and so on as you're typing your document. You can control
   which automatic changes Word makes, or you can turn AutoFormat off
   completely.

 - You can automatically format selected document text or the entire unformatted
   document, such as an e-mail message, in one pass with the AutoFormat command.
   You will be able to review, accept, or reject each change.

 - Word automatically formats headings and lists in your plain text WordMail
   messages when you open them. You can easily distinguish the current message
   from the previous messages in the e-mail stream.

By default, AutoFormat is "on" the first time you start Word. You can turn off
the options that you don't want.

This article describes how to disable (turn off) the AutoFormat features in
