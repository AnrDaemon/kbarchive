The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

SUMMARY
=======

This article specifies what is wrong with the explanation of the Redirector
Server Sessions Counter in Performance Monitor and gives you a corrected
explanation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Performance Monitor, if you choose Add To Chart from the Edit menu, the Add
To Chart dialog box appears. If you then select Redirector in the Object field
and Server Sessions in the Counter list and choose Explanation, the following
incorrect Counter Definition information appears:

   Server Sessions counts the number of active security objects the Redirector
   is managing. For example, a Logon to a server followed by a network access to
   the same server will establish one connection, but two sessions.

This explanation incorrectly states that this counter counts only the number of
active security objects and, therefore, active connections to other computers.

However, this counter specifies the total number of connections (whether still
active or not) the computer has made over the period the redirector is running.
The following is an example of a corrected Counter Definition:

   Server Sessions counts the total number of security objects the Redirector
   has managed since the Redirector was started. For example, a Logon to a
   server followed by a network access to the same server will establish one
   connection, but two sessions.
