SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DesignJet 600 plotter connected to any
model HP JetDirect card in Windows 95, the HP JetDirect software incorrectly
identifies the plotter as an HP LaserJet IIIsi printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To print to a DesignJet plotter connected to a JetDirect card, install the HP
DraftMaster II printer driver and redirect the printing to the JetDirect object
on the network.

To install the DraftMaster II printer driver, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Double-click the Add Printer icon.

3. Click Next, click Local Printer, and then click Next.

4. In the Manufacturers box, click HP. In the Printers box, click DraftMaster
   II, and then click Next.

5. In the Available Ports box, click LPT1 and then click Next.

6. In the Printer Name box, type a name for the printer. If you print from
   MS-DOS-based programs, click the Yes option, and then click Next.

7. When you are prompted "Would you like to print a test page?" click No, and
   then click Finish.

To connect to the JetDirect object on the network, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the DraftMaster II printer, and then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

3. On the Details tab, click Add Port.

   path to the printer" box, and then click OK.

5. Click OK.
