TITLE   :Multiple CRC Errors and Hardware Overruns Using RAS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

RAS Monitor reports multiple CRC errors and Hardware Overruns when you transfer
files over a Remote Access Service (RAS) connection. This problem occurs on your
Windows NT 3.51 RAS client computer if you have installed Windows NT 3.51
Service Pack 2 and you are using the ATAPI.SYS device driver.

NOTE: The ATAPI.SYS device driver is used for IDE CD-ROM drives and Enhanced IDE
(EIDE) hard disks.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use one of the following:

 - Use the Atapi.sys device driver from the original Windows NT 3.51
   distribution media. Copy the original Windows NT 3.51 Atapi.sys file to your
   %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers directory.

   NOTE: This workaround should be used only if you do not require the updated
   ATAPI.SYS device driver included in Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 2 for proper
   functionality of your EIDE hard disk.

   -or-

 - Obtain the latest Service Pack for Windows NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
