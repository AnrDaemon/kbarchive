======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you are not a member of the domain Administrators or Account Operators group,
the Add Workstations To Domain right allows you to perform all the actions
explained below.

This right does not exist in Windows NT 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Add Workstations To Domain right allows you to do all of the following:

 - Remotely add workstation and server (non-domain controller) computer accounts
   to a domain. To add computer accouts use the Add To Domain command in Server
   Manager.

 - Remotely remove computer accounts that you created. To do remove computer
   accounts select the computer account in Server Manager and use the Remove
   From Domain command.

   NOTE: Regarding the first two listings above, if you only have the Add
   Workstations To Domain right, but not the Administrator or Account Operator
   right, you can use your right only remotely. You must be connected to the
   server as a client user having the rights, and you must use Server Manager
   for Domains from the Windows NT Resource kit on the client computer to make
   the change.

 - 

   Join the domain from a Windows NT client. To join the domain
                          run Control
    Panel and choose Network and specify your username and
                           password.

   NOTE: The following Network Settings popup may appear:

      Unable to add or change accounts on the domain. The
      account information entered does not grant sufficient
      privilege to create
      or change accounts.

   You can join a domain under a computer account only if the
   computer account does not exist or if you add the computer
   account. If an Administrator or Account Operator adds the
   computer account, the computer account must be removed by an
   Administrator or Account Operator before you can join the
   domain under that computer account.
