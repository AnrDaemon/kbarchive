The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The following error message appears when you select a data source with
Starware's StarSQL ODBC/DRDA driver that ships with SNA Server versions 2.11 and
3.0:

   Distributed Data Management (DDM) parameter value X'2124' not supported.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DDM error '2124' is a result of an incompatibility between Visual C++ and DB2 on
the Mainframe. StarSQL is programmed using Visual C++ causing the problem above.
The problem occurs only when using Windows NT 3.5 and later, and accessing
tables on a mainframe (DB2/MVS).

To mask this error message, go to the data source in question from the registry
and add the line IsolationLevel=2:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree, go to the following key:

   \Software\ODBC\ODBC.INI

3. Select the data source in question.

4. On the Edit menu click Add Value.

5. Add the following:

   Value: IsolationLevel
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   String: 2

6. Click OK.

Try your connection again. It should not result in the DDM x '2124' message.
