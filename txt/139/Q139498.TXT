======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Windows NT Multitasking MTA (MMTA) Setup program over
the network, you may get the following error message:

   Setup has encountered a problem.

   Please report file='COMMON\LIST1.C', Line='1013' to Microsoft Product Support
   Services.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program is expecting the location of the Microsoft Windows NT server
agent programs to be C:\MAILEXE. The error occurs because of other types of
input formats of the network drive paths.

For example, assume the N drive is mapped to \\SERVER NAME\MAILEXE share:

 - If you enter the Mailexe path as N or N:, it is not accepted. A dialog box
   with the following text will be displayed:

   The path entered is invalid.

 - If you enter the Mailexe path as N:\, it will be accepted, and Setup will
   fail with the above error message.

 - If you enter the Mailexe path as N:\MAILEXE, it will be accepted; however,
   the Setup program will create a new subdirectory under the Mailexe
   subdirectory. In this case, the executables will be installed into
   C:\MAILEXE\MAILEXE of the NT MMTA machine.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Share the parent directory that includes the \MAILEXE sudirectory, and map a
   drive to that share. For example, map a drive N to the share C:\ of the
   machine that will host the NT MMTA.

2. Enter the \MAILEXE path as N:\MAILEXE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The same error message may be reported when you try to run the Setup program
from within Microsoft Windows 95. For additional information, please see the
