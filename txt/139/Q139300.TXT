   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using SNA Remote Access Service (RAS), your SNA Server Windows NT
client is not able to see servers on the remote network and the following error
message appears when you attempt to issue the command NET VIEW
\\<server_name>, where <server_name> is a server on the remote
network:

   System error 53 has occured.
   The system path was not found.

The local SNA Server of the SNA Server Windows NT client can view servers on the
remote network.

CAUSE
=====

The following configuration can cause this problem:

An SNA Server NT client is running SNA Remote Access Service connected to a local
SNA Server over a LAN connection. The local SNA Server is then connected to a
Front End Processor. The Front End Processor is then connected to a remote SNA
Server running SNA Remote Access Service.


RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

On the SNA Server Windows NT client, add the LinkSpeed parameter in the
registry:

1. Go to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under the following subkey:

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\RAS\OTHER DEVICES\CONFIGURED\SnaRas\ 

2. Add the following:

   For Value Name: LinkSpeed
   For Data Type: REG_DWORD
   For Data: <value>

   where <value> is the baud rate of the local SNA Server link to the FEP.

   Valid values are: 2400, 4800, 9600, etc.

If the above registry entries do not correct the problem, add the
AuthenticateTimeout registry parameter:

1. Go to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under the following subkey at both the
   RAS server and client:

SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RemoteAccess\Parameters\ 

2. Add the following information:

   Value Name: AuthenticateTimeout
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Data: <value>

   where value is 240 (decimal). The default is 120.


3. Reboot.

Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:

   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\SNARAS.DLL
   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\RASSNA.DLL
   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\TRCRAS.DLL
   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\TRCRAS.DLL
