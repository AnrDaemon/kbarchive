SYMPTOMS
========

It is not possible to change the Jumps background, the Popup background, or the
Query Highlight foreground colors for the Infoviewer Topic Window.

To view this behavior for the Jumps background color, click Options on the Tools
menu, and then click the Format tab. In the Category list, click the InfoViewer
Topic Window, and in the Colors list, click Jumps. If you change the Background
color to anything other than Automatic, you will see that the InfoViewer jump's
background color does not change. If you reopen the Options dialog box and again
click InfoViewer Topic Window and Jumps, you will see that the Background list
box still says automatic.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
