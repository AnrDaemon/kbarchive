SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Hewlett-Packard Surestore 2000e tape drive with the STB
PowerGraph 64V video adapter and run NTBackup, the backup process starts
correctly but will stop responding the system during the backup. The point at
which the system stops responding appears to be random. The problem results from
a conflict with the STB PowerGraph 64V video card BIOS.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem affects STB PowerGraph 64V Video cards with BIOS rev 1.4. The
problem is expected to be fixed in the next release of the video BIOS, which
will be version 1.5.

WORKAROUND
==========

Boot Windows NT with the VGA option at the Multiboot screen, or run the machine
with the default 640x480 VGA video driver.
