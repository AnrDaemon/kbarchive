TITLE   :ECP Port with SMC Chip Set Does Not Transfer Data Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a parallel port that is configured for extended capabilities
port (ECP) mode, you may be unable to print to a printer that is connected to
the port, or to use a connection made with Direct Cable Connection that uses the
port. The print job may seem to be printed correctly, or the data may seem to be
transferred correctly, but some of the data sent to the port may be damaged.

This problem is known to occur with ECP ports that use an SMC chip set. The
following computers are known to contain ECP ports with the SMC chip set:

 - Hewlett-Packard (HP) Vectra

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the ECP port is not properly initialized. Many ECP
ports with the SMC chip set are not properly initialized when the computer is
started.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use any one of the following methods:

 - Configure the parallel port so that it is not in ECP mode. For information
   about how to do so, please consult the computer's documentation or
   manufacturer.

 - Use the SMC Setup disk included with your computer to reconfigure the ECP
   port so that it is properly initialized when you start the computer. To
   obtain the SMC Setup disk, or for information about how to use the disk to
   configure the ECP port, please consult the computer's manufacturer.

 - Obtain a newer version of the SMC chip set that resolves this problem from
   the computer's manufacturer.
