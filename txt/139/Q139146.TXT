SUMMARY
=======

You cannot integrate a 32-bit version of Microsoft Bookshelf with Microsoft Word
6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can integrate 32-bit versions of Microsoft Bookshelf with 32-bit versions of
Microsoft Word, and you can integrate 16-bit versions of Microsoft Bookshelf
with 16-bit versions of Microsoft Word.

You cannot integrate a 32-bit version of Microsoft Bookshelf with Microsoft Word
for Windows NT, version 6.0, even though Word for Windows NT is a 32-bit version
of Word.

The 32-bit versions of Bookshelf are designed to integrate with the following
versions of Word:

 - Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0

 - Microsoft Word 97

 - Microsoft Word 2000

NOTE: Bookshelf 95 is available in both 16-bit and 32-bit versions. To determine
your version of Bookshelf 95, examine the upper left corner of the product box
or the label on the Bookshelf 95 CD-ROM. If you see a "Microsoft Windows
Compatible" logo, you have the 16-bit version of Bookshelf 95. If you see a
"Designed for Microsoft Windows 95" logo, you have the 32-bit version of
Bookshelf 95.
