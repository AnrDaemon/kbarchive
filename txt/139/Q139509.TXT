TITLE   :RUI Application Does Not See STSN.REQ
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an RUI application, during a RQR-CLEAR-STSN-UNBIND processing, SNA
Server intercepts and responds to the STSN.REQ without application intervention.
The RUI application does not see the STSN.REQ.

CAUSE
=====

A CLEAR request received immediately before the STSN causes the CS1APLTR field
of the SCB to be reset. However, CS1APLTR field should only be reset when the
session is deactivated.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to the SNA Server 2.11 file SNASERVR.EXE corrects this problem.


For more information on definitions of RQR, CLEAR, STSN, and UNBIND, see the RU
Chapter of the IBM SNA Formats Guide.

STATUS
======
