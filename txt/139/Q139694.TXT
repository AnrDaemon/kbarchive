its associated functions are listed below.

Cross-Tab Wizard
----------------

The Cross-Tab Wizard creates a cross-tab query for displaying the results of a
query in a spreadsheet format. The wizard prompts you with simple questions as
you go through a brief series of steps in which you specify the databases,
tables, and fields that you want to use in your Cross-Tab query.

Form Wizard
-----------

The Form Wizard creates a form for data entry from a single table. The wizard
prompts you with simple questions as you go through a brief series of steps in
which you specify the table and fields you want to use to create controls that
appear on your form. The size of the form is based on your Maximum Design Area
setting on the Forms tab of the Options dialog box.

Graph Wizard
------------

The Graph Wizard creates a graph from a Visual FoxPro table using Microsoft
Graph. The wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a brief
series of steps in which you specify the table and fields that you want to use

The wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a brief series of
steps in which you specify a source file and whether you want to create a new
file or append the data to an existing file.

questions as you go through a brief series of steps in which you specify the

tables. The wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a brief

table with records from a child table. The wizard prompts you with simple
questions as you go through a brief series of steps in which you specify the

tables. You can choose either to save the pivot table directly in Microsoft
Excel or to add the pivot table as an embedded object on a form.

The Remote View Wizard creates views using remote data (ODBC). The wizard prompts
you with simple questions as you go through a brief series of steps in which you
specify the databases, tables, and fields that you want to use in your view. You
must have an existing database in which to store your view and an existing data
source or connection.

Table Wizard
------------

The Table Wizard creates tables based on typical table structures. You select a
table that fits your needs from the list of sample tables. You can customize the
table's structure and fields as you step through the wizard. You can also modify
the table at a later time after the wizard has saved the table.

Distribution Disks," in the Professional Features Guide.
