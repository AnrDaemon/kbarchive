TITLE   :FIX: Upsize Wizard Falsely Creates Timestamp Field on SQL 6.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fix kbMDAC250kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you clear the Add Timestamp check box in step 8 of the Upsizing Wizard, the
timestamp field may still be created in the upsized table if the upsized table
contains at least one numeric field.

RESOLUTION
==========

Save the generated SQL table creation scripts, modify the scripts to remove the
timestamp column, and use SQL pass-through with the generated scripts to create
the tables on the server. Afterwards, you can create remote views and append the
local data to the tables on the server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Wizard, and then click Upsizing.

2. Select a local database to upsize in Step 1 of the Wizard.

3. Select a previously created Microsoft SQL-Server 6.0 ODBC data source or
   connection in Step 2 of the Wizard.

4. Select an existing database on the server.

5. Select a table that has at least one numeric field to upsize in Step 6 of the
   Wizard.

6. In Step 8 of the Wizard, clear the Add timestamp check box, and then click
   Finish.

7. After the table is created in the database on the server, create a remote
   view to that table, and notice that the timestamp field was created anyway.
