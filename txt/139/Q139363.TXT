TITLE   :FIX: Setup Wizard Creates Disk Images That Are Too Big
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, Professional Edition, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Disk images created by the Setup Wizard do not fit on floppy disks. The total
file size is a few hundred or thousand bytes over what a floppy disk can hold.
This behavior occurs randomly.

CAUSE
=====

At times, the Setup Wizard underestimates the actual size of the files it is
creating because part of the file is still in memory. The actual size of the
files is therefore bigger than the size the Setup Wizard estimates.

WORKAROUND
==========

By disabling disk caching, you can prevent the Setup Wizard from miscalculating
the total size of the files. To disable caching, comment the lines in your
system files that load caching software.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.
