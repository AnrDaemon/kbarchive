SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the asterisk (*) wildcard character in an advanced search, the
search process takes an extremely long time to complete.

CAUSE
=====

Wildcard searches using the asterisk character are supported in many multimedia
programs. However, if you type an asterisk followed by the text you are
searching for, the search takes much longer because the query must search
through hundreds of thousands of words to find the words ending with the text
you specified.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid long waiting times for search results, enclose the text you are
searching for in quotation marks, or use the following search operators:

 - And
 - Or
 - Not
 - Near

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you search for words that start with the text you enter, the search process
is much faster.

For detailed information on how to search for text or keywords, please see the
Search topic in the program's online Help.

Additional query words: multi multi-media media mm
