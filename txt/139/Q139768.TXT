PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An ON ERROR routine in a Browse command is ignored and a system error message
dialog box is returned instead. When code is executed that does essentially the
same thing, the ON ERROR routine works correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open the Testdata database located in the Visual FoxPro directory under
   \Samples\Data.

2. Use the Employee table, and in the Command window, type:

   " On error wait window "Error encountered:" + Message() " (without the
   quotation marks)

3. In the Command window, type the following commands:

   " Scatter memvar
   Append blank
   Gather memvar && Note that ON ERROR routine triggers." (without the
   quotation marks)

4. Browse the table.

5. Press CTRL+Y or click Append Blank to add a new record.

6. Enter a duplicate key for emp_id, and note that the system error message is
   returned instead of the ON ERROR routine.
