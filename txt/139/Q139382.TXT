The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install CorelDraw version 3.0 revision B on a Windows 95-based
computer that is running DriveSpace 3, your computer may seem to stop responding
(hang) after you receive the following message from CorelDraw Setup:

   CorelDraw is checking for space available on your drives

To close the hung Setup program, you must press CTRL+ALT+DELETE and use the Close
Program dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

DriveSpace 3 uses 32K clusters on the hard disk. CorelDraw 3.0 revision B cannot
be installed on drives with 32K clusters.

Earlier versions of DoubleSpace and DriveSpace do not use 32K clusters for disk
compression.

RESOLUTION
==========

Corel Corporation has released an update (called Instfx.exe) that resolves this
problem. Please contact Corel Corporation to obtain this update.
