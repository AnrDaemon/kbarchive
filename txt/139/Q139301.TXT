TITLE   :FIX: C2664 Error w/Property Sheet Component Added to CDocument

KEYWORDS:kbMFC KbUIDesign kbVC400bug kbVC410bug kbVC420bug kbVC500fix kbCompGallery kbGrpDSMFCAT

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a modeless property sheet from the Property Sheet component in
the Component Gallery into a CDocument-derived class or other non-CWnd derived
class, the compiler generates this error:

   C2664:'Create' : cannot convert parameter 5 from 'class CDocDerivedClass
   *const' to 'class CWnd *' (new behavior; please see help).

CAUSE
=====

The modeless property sheet component placed in an application includes a
CMiniFrameWnd-derived class that actually contains the modeless property sheet.
When using the component, the application calls Create() on the
CMiniFrameWnd-derived class. This Create() requires a CWnd* to its parent window
as its fifth argument. The code generated for your application passes 'this' to
the Create() call. CDocument is not derived from CWnd; therefore, passing the
'this' pointer from the CDocument into the CMiniFrame::Create() function causes
the compiler error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Place the property sheet component into a class that is derived from CWnd.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. The problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.
