The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the code example listed on pages 75-76 of the Developer's Guide,
the following error occurs:

   Error with <ObjectName>- Height: Expression evaluated to an illegal
   value

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error occurs because 12 is not a valid size for the Height property of the
object when the ScaleMode property is set to 3 (Pixels). The default ScaleMode
property of the form is set to Pixels, and the object is designed to use Foxels,
even though there is a line in the DEFINE CLASS grdProducts AS Grid stating:

      ScaleMode = 0

The ScaleMode property is a property of the form, not the grid.

To use the code example, make these two changes:

1. Move the ScaleMode property into the code for the DEFINE CLASS GridForm AS
   FORM.

2. Place "Height = 12" in the PROCEDURE INIT of the grid.

By the time the grid is to be shown, the form's ScaleMode property will now be
set to 0 (Foxels).


After you make the two changes, the code from the Developer's Guide should look
like this:

      DEFINE CLASS GridForm AS FORM
          ScaleMode = 0
          <other statements>
      ENDDEFINE

      DEFINE CLASS grdProducts AS Grid
       <other statements>

        PROCEDURE INIT
          This.Height = 12
        ENDPROC

      ENDDEFINE
