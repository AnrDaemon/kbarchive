--------------------

1. In Visual FoxPro, create and run a program (.prg file) that contains the
   following code:

         * Start of program code
         *
         MyF3 = ON("KEY","F3")
         ON KEY LABEL F3 DO getout
         
         oleWorkBook = getobject("C:\BOOK1.XLS")
         WITH oleWorkBook.Application
            .Visible = .t.
         
            .Windows(1).Visible = .t.
            *Selects cells A1:D5, then makes cell D1 the active cell.
            .ActiveSheet.Range("A1:D5").Select
         ENDWITH
         READ EVENTS
         
         PROCEDURE getout
         Clear EVENTS
         oleExcel.Quit
         ON KEY LABEL F3 &MyF3

   Excel.
