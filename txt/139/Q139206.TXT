TITLE   :Hardware List Not Updated After Installing New .inf File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbhw win95 kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to install a new Setup information (.inf) file by placing the file in
the Windows\Inf folder, the new device may not appear in the hardware list for
that type of device, and may not be properly detected by Windows 95. If you
replace an existing .inf file with a newer version, the device appears in the
hardware list and is properly detected, but Windows 95 may not use the
information in the newer file when you install the device.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Windows 95 did not rebuild the driver information
database after you placed the new or updated .inf file in the Windows\Inf
folder.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Place the new or updated .inf file in the Windows\Inf folder.

2. If you are installing a new .inf file for a device that is not currently
   installed, skip to step 3. If you are replacing an existing .inf file with a
   newer version, follow these steps:

   a. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

   b. On the Device Manager tab, double-click the hardware branch for the type
      of device you are updating.

   c. Click the device you are updating, and then click Remove.

   d. Click OK.

3. At a command prompt, type the following lines. Press ENTER after each line:

   " cd \windows\inf
   ren drvdata.bin drvdata.xxx
   ren drvidx.bin drvidx.xxx " (without the quotation marks)

4. Install the device using the Add New Hardware tool in Control Panel or using
   the tool appropriate to the device type (such as the Add Printer tool or the
   Install New Modem Wizard.
