-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Visual FoxPro Help file "WindowType Property" topic states incorrectly that
the WindowType property settings of '2 - Read' and '3 - Read Modal' are
available for a formset or form.

These settings are actually only available on a formset converted from an earlier
version of FoxPro by using the Converter. They are for backwards compatibility
only. The WindowType property settings of '0 - Modeless' and '1 - Modal' are not
affected.

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

Additional query words: docerr VFoxWin 5.00
