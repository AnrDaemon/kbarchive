TITLE   :BUG: Mpw2lib Fails on Long File Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, Macintosh Cross-Development Addon, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When converting MPW-formatted object files for file names longer than the
standard 8.3 MS-DOS format, Mwp2lib may generate an application error similar to
one of these:

   The instruction at xxxx referenced memory at xxxx. The memory could not be
   written.

   -or-

   The instruction at xxxx referenced memory at xxxx. The memory could not be
   read.

CAUSE
=====

Mpw2lib cannot handle an object file that has a file name longer than the
standard 8.3 MS-DOS format.

RESOLUTION
==========

Truncate the object file name to eight characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mpw2lib is a Windows utility used to convert MPW (Macintosh Programmer's
Workbench) formatted object files to COFF (Common Object File Format) library
files. The resulting file can be linked with code generated by Visual C++ for
Macintosh. The file is transferred from the Macintosh to the Windows system
using the Mfile utility. Windows NT allows you to preserve the long file names
of the Macintosh in most cases.

You may not receive the error message for long file names. The problem appears to
be inconsistent and can appear more frequently with longer file names.
Occasionally, you may generate the following error instead of the previously
listed error messages:

   Fatal error M2L1003: Can't open file "xxx.o"

In general, however, it is safe to stay with long file names.
