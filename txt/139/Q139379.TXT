TITLE   :Cannot Load Lucida Typewriter Font
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the SNA Server Windows NT 3270 applet, the following message
appears:

   Cannot load lucida typewriter font. Please ensure that ltype.ttf is
   in the windows system directory.

CAUSE
=====

Snafiles.inf does not tell setup to copy Ltype.ttf to the
<ntroot>\system32 directory. This occurs only when you select only the
3270 emulator in SNA Server Setup dialog box: Optional Components. If the
defaults are accepted by the user, Ltype.ttf gets copied appropriately.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the file SNAFILES.INF to correct this problem.

To work around this problem, copy the \CLIENTS\WINNT\I386\LTYPE.TTF from the SNA
Server compact disc to the SYSTEM32 directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
