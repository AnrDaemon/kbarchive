TITLE   :SMS Despooler May GP Fault with No Distribute Phase
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork sms

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a Run Command On Workstation job that has no distribute phase
selected, a General Protection Fault (GPF) or Access Violation occurs with the
SMS Executive Service.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs when a command line is sent to a workstation but there is no actual
package needed to perform the command. There must be at least one file in the
package source, but this source does not need to be placed on a distribution
server.

When the despooler thread of the SMS Executive attempts to manipulate the list of
distribution servers, it finds an empty list and would end abnormally.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
