TITLE   :Running Batch File Through PIF Returns Different Results
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a batch file through a program information file (PIF), and run the
batch file from File Manager or the MS-DOS Command Prompt (CMD.EXE), different
results appear.

For example, a batch file contains the following lines:

   If not exist C:\test echo 1
   pause

If you run the batch file from File Manager or CMD.EXE and the TEST directory
does not exist, nothing is echoed. If the directory exists, 1 is echoed. If you
create and run a PIF for the batch file, and whether or not the TEST directory
exists, 1 is echoed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
