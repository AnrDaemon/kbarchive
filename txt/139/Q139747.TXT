KEYWORDS:kbnetwork 3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClientkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive a "Not enough space" error message when you try to save a file
from an MS-DOS-based program to a Novell NetWare server with more than 2
gigabytes (GB) of free disk space.

CAUSE
=====

When a program checks to see if there is enough space on a NetWare volume, the
Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks reports numbers larger than older programs
were designed to handle. When the program calculates the free space on the
NetWare volume the value calculated is too large for the program to handle, and
a value of zero is reported.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, shut down Windows 95, restart the computer in
MS-DOS mode, and use the real-mode provider included with Windows 95. Type the
following lines at the command prompt:

   "c:\net start nwredir" (without the quotation marks)
   "c:\net use <drive letter>:\\servername>\<volume>" (without the
   quotation marks)

Or, use a real-mode redirector provided by Novell (such as NETX or VLM).


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This fix is enabled by the following BINARY registry value:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\NWREDIR\LargeDiskSizeCompatibility=01

When this update is installed and this registry value is present, NWRedir scales
down the bytes-per-sector (bps), sectors-per-cluster (spc), and free-clusters
(fc) values so as not to overflow a 16-bit unsigned integer when the values are
multiplied together.
