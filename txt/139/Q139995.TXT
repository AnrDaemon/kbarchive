-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use AppWizard or ClassWizard to join tables that contain columns that
have identical names in an MFC application, you may receive an exception when
the recordset is opened. The exception indicates that there has been an:

   Ambiguous field reference '[column]'

where column corresponds to the name of a column that appears in multiple tables
of the join.

When you try to modify a record in an MFC DAO application that uses a recordset
based on a join and that was created by AppWizard or ClassWizard, the
application may throw an exception on the update. Specifically, the exception
indicates:

   Item not found in this collection.

CAUSE
=====

AppWizard and ClassWizard apply too many constraints when comparing column names
of joined tables for duplication. Column names should be considered duplicate
and should therefore be qualified with the appropriate table name (for example,
[Table].[Column]) based solely on the name string. However, the wizards
additionally check the type and, in the case where the type can have a variable
length (such as the Text type), the maximum length of the field. As a result, if
columns in joined tables share the same name but are of different types or have
different maximum sizes, table name qualifiers are not applied and the column
names constitute ambiguous references.

When the wizards generate references to columns that have names that appear in
multiple tables of the join, the wizards will precede the column name with the
name of the table as a qualifier. Both the table name qualifier and column name
are enclosed in brackets in the DFX functions of the CDaoRecordset-derived
class's DoFieldExchange. For example:

   [Table].[Column]

The presence of the brackets combined with the use of the table name qualifier
causes the search for the specified field in the collection of fields maintained
by the database engine to fail.

NOTE: The presence of brackets around unqualified column names does not interfere
with the field name search and is thus acceptable. This explains why some fields
will be updatable while attempts to update others throws the exception; the
updatable fields are likely unique and therefore unqualified.

RESOLUTION
==========

In those cases where AppWizard or ClassWizard have mistakenly omitted table name
qualifiers, add them manually. How you do it depends on whether your application
is an ODBC or a DAO database application.

ODBC Applications
-----------------

Add the table qualifiers to the ambiguous references in the RFX functions of your
CRecordset-derived class's DoFieldExchange. Be sure to enclose the table
qualifier in square brackets [] if the name is a reserved word or contains
spaces as in this example:

   [Table 1].[Column 1]

DAO Applications
----------------

Add the table qualifiers to the ambiguous references in the DFX functions of your
CDaoRecordset-derived class's DoFieldExchange. Follow this procedure:

1. Add qualifiers only to those columns that are duplicates. Qualifying columns
   where no ambiguity exists will result in errors as described in the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q139994 Specifying Table Name with Column Name in MFC DAO

2. Add the appropriate table name qualifier to any column that appears in more
   than one of the joined tables. The exact form to use is described in detail
   in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q139997 "Item not found in this collection" with MFC DAO Join

   NOTE: The content of Q139997 has been copied into the "References" of this
   article for your convenience.

To work around this problem, use one of the following two techniques depending on
the names of the affected tables and columns (the ones for which table
qualifiers are necessary).

If Table and Column Names Contain No Spaces
-------------------------------------------

Remove the brackets that enclose the table and column names. The resulting
reference should be of this form:

   Table.Column

If Table and/or Column Names Contain Spaces
-------------------------------------------

Don't remove the bracket delimiters or your application will throw an exception
that indicates:

   Syntax error in query expression 'table name.column name'.

Instead, you must override one of the existing overloads of the virtual function
CDaoRecordset::SetFieldValue() as follows (assuming your CDaoRecordset is named
CMyDaoRecordset):

      void CMyDaoRecordset::SetFieldValue(LPCTSTR lpszName,
                                     const COleVariant& varValue)
      {
           CString strNewName(lpszName);
           StripBrackets(strNewName, strNewName.GetBuffer(0));
           strNewName.ReleaseBuffer();
           CDaoRecordset::SetFieldValue(strNewName, varValue);
      }

This override uses the StripBrackets member function of CDaoRecordset to remove
the offending brackets and allows the search for the field in the field
collection to succeed.

NOTE: You can easily add this override to your application by using the Visual
C++ ClassView Add Member Function command. Please refer to the online
documentation and Help files for more details about this command.
