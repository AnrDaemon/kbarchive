TITLE   :Windows 95 Disconnects Attempting to Connect to Windows NT RAS
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you dial in using Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking client software to a
Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS) Server with the correct user name and
password, the following error message appears:

   Password expired. Contact your network administrator.

When you click OK, you are disconnected.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if your password has expired or been reset with the "User
Must Change Password at Next Logon" option. In addition, Windows 95 Dial-Up
Networking does not support the ChangePassword CHAP functionality provided by
Windows NT RAS/PPP servers.

Users who connect to Windows NT RAS servers with expired passwords are
disconnected without the opportunity to change their password.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - In Windows NT Server, enable the "Password Never Expires" option for the
   user.

   -OR-

 - Do not force users to change passwords set by the Administrator. In Windows
   NT Server, click to clear the "User Must Change Password at Next Logon" check
   box for the user.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Windows 95. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
