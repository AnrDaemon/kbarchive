TITLE   :Packages Not Detected By Inventory Agent
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you set the Hardware and Software Scan intervals from Site Properties
Inventory such that the Software scan be performed more often than the hardware
scan, the software scan fails to report packages.

CAUSE
=====

The Software Scan scans each local disk installed, but if the Hardware Scan is
not performed, the Software Scan does not have a valid list of installed disks
to scan. The Software Scan should perform a minimal drive detection so that it
knows what drives to scan.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, ensure that both the Hardware and Software Scan
intervals are set to the same frequency.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. A fix to this problem is in development, but has not been
regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft
does not recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information on the availability of this fix.
