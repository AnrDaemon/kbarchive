You cannot assign editor functions to the following keys when you click
Customize on the Tools menu, and then click the Keyboard tab in Visual C++,
versions 4.x:

 - TAB
 - SHIFT+TAB
 - ENTER
 - BACKSPACE
 - ALT+BACKSPACE
 - CTRL+BACKSPACE

Visual C++, versions 5.0 and 6.0, can customize all of these keys except
BACKSPACE.

Any attempt to use restricted keys results in the default dialog/editor
functionality.

======

This bug was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++, version 6.0.
