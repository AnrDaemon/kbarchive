KEYWORDS:win95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Windows 95 ATI Mach 32 video card drivers, you may see
random characters on the screen or experience random fatal exception 0E errors.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by timing errors between the video card and the
computer when too many of the card's performance features are enabled. ATI
Technical Support has confirmed that the problem is caused by subtle differences
in bus timing when an ISA card is being used. The problem is computer dependent.
On most computers, the bus can handle the increased demands created by the
performance options, but some computers cannot. The video card configuration
options exist to deal with these instances.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable one or more of the performance settings on the video card using the
Install.exe program included with the ATI video card. For information about
configuring the performance settings or using the Install.exe tool, please
consult the video card's documentation or manufacturer.
