TITLE   :D-Link Network Adapter Not Recognized During Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade a computer from Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 to Windows
95, the D-Link NDIS 3 network driver used in Windows for Workgroups is not
recognized by Windows 95. When you start Windows 95, you receive the following
error message:

   Your network adapter is not working properly. You may need to set it up
   again. For more information, see the Network Troubleshooter in Windows Help.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 Setup detects the D-Link network adapter as an NE2000 or compatible
network adapter, and uses the default addressing for the NE2000 or compatible
card. Setup detects the presence of the adapter, but cannot set up the correct
resources. Setup sets the network adapter to use IRQ 3 and I/O address 300,
which may not work and may conflict with another device.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the resources assigned to the network adapter to avoid a conflict. To
do so, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.

2. Click the network adapter, and then click Properties.

3. On the Resources tab, select an available Interrupt and I/O address range.

4. Click OK.

5. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.
