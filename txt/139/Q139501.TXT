TITLE   :VB CPIC Application Returns CM_PRODUCT_SPECIFIC_ERROR (20)
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run identical C and Visual Basic (VB) CPIC applications, the C
application works correctly but the VB application fails on cmalloc() with the
following error:

   return code 20: cm_product_specific_error

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Windows 3.x client software incorrectly parses the CPIC
application program name, so its associated transaction program entries in the
WIN.INI file (such as the LocalLU parameter) are not found.

For example, if your application name is WIN-UP.EXE, under C it is known as
WIN-UP. The VB application sees this as WIN-UP.EXE. If you are not pooling Local
LUs as per Q132720 (SNA Server CPIC Allocate Error 20) the above error appears,
even if you have defined the following in the WIN.INI file of the client
computer:

      [WIN_UP]
      APPCLLU=<LOCALLU>

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

 - Contact Microsoft Product Support for an update to SNA Server 2.11 and
   WINCPIC.DLL library.

   -OR-

 - Enable pooling. For additional information, please see the following
   article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base: Q132720 SNA Server CPIC Allocate
   Error 20 (CM_PRODUCT_SPECIFIC_ERROR)

STATUS
======

problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
