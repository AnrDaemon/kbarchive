TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Err Msg: Problem Occurred Initializing MSSCHED.DLL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Schedule+ for Windows, you may receive the following error:

   STOP: A Problem Occurred Initializing MSSCHED.DLL, which prevents Microsoft
   Schedule+ from running.


CAUSE
=====

This error is not actually caused by the MSSCHED.DLL file, but it may be caused
by one of the following:

 - The file TRNSCHED.DLL is not present, is corrupt, is not accessible through
   the path statement, or has been renamed.

 - The SCHEDULETRANSPORT= entry in the SCHDPLUS.INI is incorrect. The correct
   setting should be the one of the following:

   SCHEDULETRANSPORT=TRNSCHED.DLL

   -OR-

   SCHEDULETRANSPORT=TRNSCHED

   If the above line contains a path to the file (for example,
   C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\TRNSCHED.DLL), even if it is the correct path, it will not
   work. The SCHEDULETRANSPORT entry cannot have a path of any kind.

   Notes:

    - The SCHEDULETRANSPORT= line does not have to be present in the INI file.
      Schedule+ is designed so that it will look for TRNSCHED.DLL by default.

    - The TRNSCHED.DLL file provides access to local and postoffice calendar
      files (*.CAL)

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that the TRNSCHED.DLL is present, or its directory is in the path
statement. If the file is present and/or in the path statement, check the
SCHDPLUS.INI for the correct spelling of the SCHEDULETRANSPORT line. The section
in the SCHDPLUS.INI file should be the following:

   [Microsoft Schedule+]
   SCHEDULETRANSPORT = TRNSCHED.DLL
