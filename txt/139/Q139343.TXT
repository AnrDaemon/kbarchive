A Backup Domain Controller (BDC) can be connected to a remote domain
using Windows NT Server Remote Access Service (RAS). To promote a BDC that
is connected through RAS to a primary domain controller (PDC):

1. Configure the BDC as a Dial-out-only RAS client. The Remote Access Server
   service should not be running on this BDC. By having just the RAS client dial
   out services on this BDC, it can function as a PDC because that functionality
   does not depend on Netlogon.

2. If you promote the RAS-connected client, Netlogon stops, changes roles and
   restarts. RAS is dependent on Netlogon, so when Netlogon stops, the
   connection is lost.

3. A RAS-connected BDC that has been promoted to PDC functions as it should, but
   possibly with slower response time, depending on line speed.
