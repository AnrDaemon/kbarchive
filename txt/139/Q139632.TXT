PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run INSTSRV.EXE in the Windows NT Resource Kit, the
following error message appears:

   instsrv.c Error 1057 from CreateService on line 103

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the default administrator account name (Administrator)
has been renamed to a different name. The administrator account name must be
Administrator when this program is executed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, rename the administrator account name back to
Administrator.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Resource Kit versions
3.5 and 3.51. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT Version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following tools in the Windows NT Resource Kit rely on built-in account
names:

 - FLOPLOCK

 - C2CONFIG

These tools use the group names Administrators and Power User. You must have
Power User rights to access the floppy drive when using FLOPLOCK, but you do not
have to be a member of the Administrators group. The C2CONFIG is known to leave
the computer in an unusable state on international versions of Windows NT.

Some of the Windows NT Resource Kit tools do not work on most international
versions of Windows NT, because the name of the administrator account is
localized. German uses the same account name, but other languages use a
different name for administrator.
