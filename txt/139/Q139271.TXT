======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Visual C++ version 4.0 or later to include the Developer Studio
keyboard compatibility, and you then switch to Visual C++ 2.0 compatibility and
back again, several of the key settings do not revert to Developer Studio.

For example, the Edit category in the Main editor should have CTRL+Y assigned to
the Redo function for Developer Studio and CTRL+A for Visual C++ 2.0
compatibility. However, if you change from Developer Studio to 2.0 and back,
CTRL+A remains the key sequence for the Redo function. In addition, the Compile
function is CTRL+F7 in the Developer Studio and CTRL+F8 in Visual C++ 2.0. Other
keys may also be affected.

Switching from Visual C++ 2.0 compatibility to Epsilon and Brief works correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Assuming you have selected Developer Studio as your compatibility option and you
still have the Visual C++ 2.0 setting enabled, follow these steps:

1. Reset the options to be Visual C++ 2.0 in the Compatibility tab of the
   Options dialog box, and click the OK button to accept the change.

2. Reset the options to be Developer Studio.

After clicking OK, you can verify the keys are set correctly by inspecting the
Redo item in the Edit menu; Its shortcut key should be CTRL+Y.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Starting with a fresh installation of Visual C++ 4.0 or later, run the
   Developer Studio.

2. Look at the Edit menu. Redo should use CTRL+Y as its shortcut key.

3. Set the keyboard compatibility to Visual C++ 2.0.

4. Look at the Edit menu. Redo should use CTRL+A as its shortcut key.

5. Exit Msdev.exe.

6. Restart the Developer Studio.

7. Look at the Edit menu. Redo still uses CTRL+A as its shortcut key.

8. Reset the keyboard compatibility to Developer Studio.

9. Look at the Edit menu. Redo should use CTRL+Y as its shortcut key, but it
   still uses CTRL+A.
