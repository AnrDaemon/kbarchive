PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks and you are
connected to a NetWare volume on which long filename support has been enabled,
you may receive the following error message if you change to a directory with a
long filename and then use the DIR command:

   Path Not Found

This problem may occur when you change to a directory with a long filename from a
command prompt using the directory's 8.3 alias instead of its long filename.

Note that this problem occurs only at a command prompt; it does not occur when
you are using Windows Explorer or My Computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem, use the directory's long filename instead of its 8.3
alias when you change to the directory at a command prompt.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
