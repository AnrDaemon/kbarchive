TITLE   :TN3270: Message Close Delay Option

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The TN3270 Server Administration program in SNA Server 2.11 and the Settings tab
of the TN3270 Server Properties in SNA Server 3.0 allow the administrator to
configure the "Message Close Delay" timer. This timer is used to close the
TCP/IP connection between the client and server. The more information section
gives an example where this option can be used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the "Message Close Delay" timer to configure how quickly TN3270
disconnects clients that have failed to negotiate successfully with the TN3270
server, but have not yet closed their TCP/IP connection. This becomes important
when you have hundreds of clients connecting and resources are limited.

NOTE: Some TN3270 emulators wait until the TN3270 server closes the connection
before returning control to the application. When this happens users have to
wait until this timer expires before they can do anything.

The following TN3270 server trace illustrates the default 10 second close delay
timer. Note the 10 second time delay in handling the
"Event=TEV_SessionTermination". For more information on TN3270 tracing refer to
appendix B of the TN3270 Admin guide.
