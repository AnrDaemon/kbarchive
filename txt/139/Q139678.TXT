TITLE   :APPC Problem Handling AP_PGM Security with NULL Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an APPC application issues an Allocate using AP_PGM conversation security and
specifies a password of NULL (where the remote system is configured with
conversation security and a zero-length password), the Allocate will fail with a
sense code of 080F6051 (AP_SECURITY_NOT_VALID).

CAUSE
=====

Instead of sending a zero length password in the FMH-5 Attach message, the SNA
Server APPC library sends a 1-byte password set to a value of "0x40", instead of
specifying a NULL password as it should.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the files, WAPPC32.DLL (for Windows NT), WINAPPC.DLL (for
Windows 3.x), and APPC.DLL (for OS/2), to correct this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
