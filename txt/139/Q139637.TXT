TITLE   :FIX: Developer Studio Ignores /nologo Linker Setting
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::4.0,4.1,4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVC500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Linker (LINK.EXE), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Deselecting the Suppress Startup Banner (/nologo) linker option from within the
Developer Studio does not cause the linker banner to display when building the
project.

CAUSE
=====

When building from within Developer Studio, the linker is spawned directly from
the environment. The linker does not echo the command line options unless the
options are received from a linker response file.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you need to view the linker options, on the Project menu, click Settings, and
click the Link tab. In the Settings For box, select the target for which you
want to view the options. The command line options will appear under Project
Options.

The only way to see the actual command line while executing is to build the
project from the command line. To do this, you may need to run the Vcvars32.bat
file in the \Msdev\Bin directory to set up the environment variables. Change to
the directory containing the project makefile and enter this command:

      nmake /f <MakefileName.mak>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.
