TITLE   :Problems Printing from Mastering Visual FoxPro
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mastering Series
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbmm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Mastering Microsoft Visual FoxPro 3.0, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When printing from Microsoft Mastering Visual FoxPro, you may experience general
protection faults (GP faults).

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem can be caused by several different factors. The following details
possible solutions to try:

 - When a document is being printed, avoid clicking the mouse on the screen or
   attempting to access other applications. When a document is being printed,
   you will not be able to access other applications that are running. Also, the
   Cancel button that is displayed is not functional and should not be clicked.

 - The system may be low on memory or free resources. Attempt to free up some
   memory or resources by closing other applications that are running. Also, see
   the section "Running in Low Memory or Running Slowly" in the Readme.txt
   included with the product.

If the problem still persists, there are two other alternatives available:

 - There is a print utility that is available for Mastering Visual FoxPro. (On
   CompuServe, in the Visual FoxPro forum [go VFOX], in the Mastering VFP
   library section.) This utility is a separate program that uses the CD-ROM to
   print any of the documents in the product. For individuals who have been
   having problems printing directly from the product, this utility has worked
   for them. The print utility is Mvfp_pri.exe.

 - All of the documents inside the product are available as RTF files. As a last
   resort, you can use Word for Windows (or any other word processor that reads
   RTF files) to open these files and print the desired documents.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mastering Visual FoxPro version
1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
