TITLE   :PRB: Import Wizard Shows the First 50 Records Only
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While running the Import Wizard, you can only see the first 50 records in any of
the wizard windows. If you click the Options button in the second Import Wizard
window and select the Scan All Records check box in the Import Wizard Options
window, you can still see only the first 50 records. If you click the Options
button in the second Import Wizard window, you'll see that the Scan All Records
check box is cleared, as if you never selected it.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The wizard only displays the first 50 records from the data source regardless of
whether if you select the Scan All Records check box or not. The wizard does not
retain the Scan All Records check box state (selected or cleared).

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Use the Customer table which ships with Visual FoxPro.

2. Type the following command in the Command window:

      COPY TO test.txt TYPE DELIMITED

3. On the Tools menu, click Wizards.

4. On the Wizards list, click Import.

5. Select your text file (Test.txt) as the source file, and click Next. Scroll
   to the bottom of the list of records, and note that only the first 50 are
   displayed.

6. Click Options, and then select the Scan All Records check box. Click OK.
   Scroll to the bottom of the list of records, and note only the first 50
   records are displayed.

7. Click Options, and note that the Scan All Records check box is clear. Select
   the Scan All Records check box again, and click OK.

8. Finish the wizard, and note the total number of imported records matches the
   number of records in the Customer table.
