PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

Some TrueType fonts from other versions of Windows or third party font vendors
do not produce glyphs on Windows NT 3.51.

For example, if you install the Traditional Arabic font (Trad.ttf) from Arabic
Windows 3.11 in Windows NT 3.51, it does not produce glyphs. The font installs,
but it displays the default character when you attempt to display it, indicating
the character codes do not have a glyph.

The TrueType fonts most likely to encounter this problem are those which have
been constructed for foreign language versions of windows like Arabic Windows
3.11 or 3.1.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has modified the file, WINSRV.DLL, to correct this problem. Upgrade to
the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
