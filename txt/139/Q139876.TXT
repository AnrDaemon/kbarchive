TITLE   :Non-CompuServe Recipients Not Listed in CIS Mail Header
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send mail to multiple recipients using different service providers,
CompuServe recipients do not see recipients on other service providers in the
message header. Recipients on other service providers see all the other
recipients, regardless of service provider, in the message header.

RESOLUTION
==========

Messages on CompuServe cannot display recipients on other service providers in
the message header.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Transports are not required to send along addresses they cannot resolve. If
addresses are sent along for non-CompuServe recipients, you might expect a
CompuServe recipient to be able to send a reply to all the recipients of the
message. However, the CompuServe address book does not have the ability to
resolve non-CompuServe addresses.
