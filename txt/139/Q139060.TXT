TITLE   :Cannot Resolve TCP/IP Names with 32-Bit Programs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the TCP/IP protocol with a server-based installation of Windows 95,
you may be unable to resolve TCP/IP names when you are using 32-bit programs.
This problem is known to occur when a DNS or WINS server is used to resolve
TCP/IP names, or when a HOSTS or LMHOSTS file is used. The problem does not
occur with 16-bit programs.

CAUSE
=====

When you install the TCP/IP protocol, Windows 95 creates a new value called
HelperDllName under the following registry key:

   Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Mstcp\ 
   Parameters\Winsock

Windows 95 also creates a new value called ProviderPath under the following
registry key:

   Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Mstcp\ 
   ServiceProvider

Both of these registry values are given the following value:

   %windir%\system\wsock32.dll

This value causes Windows 95 to look for the Wsock32.dll file in your personal
Windows\System folder on your local hard disk, the network server, or a floppy
disk. However, when you are using a server-based installation of Windows 95, the
Wsock32.dll file is located in the System folder in the shared Windows folder on
the network server.

If Windows 95 is unable to locate the Wsock32.dll file, it is unable to resolve
TCP/IP names when you use 32-bit programs that require TCP/IP name resolution.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Create a System folder in your personal Windows folder, and then copy the
   Wsock32.dll file from the System folder that is in the shared Windows folder
   on the network server to the new folder.

   NOTE: If you are a network administrator and you are implementing this
   workaround on multiple server-based installations of Windows 95, you must
   create a System folder in each user's personal Windows folder, and then copy
   the Wsock32.dll file to each of the new System folders.

 - NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys
   And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
   should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
   before you edit the registry.

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
   require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
   resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
   Registry Editor at your own risk.

   Modify the registry entries listed earlier in this article so that the values
   for HelperDllName and ProviderPath are set to the correct path for the
   Wsock32.dll file. For example, if the shared Windows folder on the network
   server is called Winnet, and the network server is mapped as drive F, the
   HelperDllName and ProviderPath values should be given the following value:

   f:\winnet\system\wsock32.dll

   NOTE: This workaround is not preferred. The next time you add or remove a
   network component, the new value may be replaced with the original value.

 - To prevent this problem from occurring with future installations of Windows
   95, modify the Nettrans.inf file so that the HelperDllName and ProviderPath
   registry values are given the correct value when you install Windows 95 from
   the network server.

   NOTE: Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files, and
   Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) does not support this procedure.
   Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
   described, you should make a backup copy of your .inf file before you
   proceed.

   To modify the Nettrans.inf file so that this problem does not occur when you
   install Windows 95 from the network server, open the file in any text editor
   and replace both instances of "%windir%" with "%25%" (without quotation
   marks). Save the file, and then copy it to the shared Windows folder on the
   network server, and to the Inf and Suwin folders in the shared Windows folder
   on the network server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
