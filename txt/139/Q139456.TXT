The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The information in this article is included in the documentation starting
with Visual C++ 5.0. Look there for future revisions.

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to build or rebuild a project after performing a line coverage
profile by clicking Profile on the Tools menu results in this error message:

   LNK1201: error writing to program database
   "c:\MSDEV\Projects\yourapp\Debug\yourapp.pdb"; check for insufficient disk
   space

CAUSE
=====

Developer Studio does not close the project's program database file (.pdb file)
after doing a line profile. Upon attempting to rebuild the project, the linker
cannot write to the project's .pdb file, which causes the LNK1201 error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Exit Developer Studio. Then restart Developer Studio, and reload your
   project.

-or-

 - Use a batch file to line profile your application. Specifying the Lcover.bat
   file in the Custom Settings of the Profile dialog box will perform the same
   profile as specifying line coverage. Any profiling batch file may be called
   in this way, allowing Lcover.bat to be customized to fit your particular
   needs. For more information on using a batch file to profile your
   application, please see the following topics in the Help file:
