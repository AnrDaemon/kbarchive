TITLE   :Using Long Filenames with the Run Command
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95 4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you click Run on the Start menu and then type a command including a long
filename with an embedded space in the Run dialog box, one of the following
symptoms may occur:

 - You receive the following error message: Cannot find <filename> (or one
   of its components). Make sure the path and filename are correct and that all
   required libraries are available.

 - An incorrect folder is opened or the wrong file is run.

CAUSE
=====

Commands containing long filenames with embedded space characters must be
enclosed in quotation marks in the Run dialog box.

Note that long filenames that do not contain embedded spaces are processed
correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - To use a command including a long filename with an embedded space character
   in the Run dialog box, you must enclose the entire command in quotation
   marks. For example, to run the command

   c:\program files\accessories\mspaint.exe

   you must type the following line in the Run dialog box (including the
   quotation marks:

   "c:\program files\accessories\mspaint.exe"

 - In the Run dialog box, use the 8.3 alias for any folder or filename that
   contains embedded spaces. For example, instead of typing

   "c:\program files\accessories\mspaint.exe"

   in the Run dialog box, you could type:

   c:\progra~1\accessories\mspaint.exe

   In this example, "progra~1" is the 8.3 alias for the long filename "program
   files."

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you type a long filename with embedded spaces without quotation marks in
the Run dialog box, the filename is truncated at the first space when the
command is processed.
