PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Microsoft Mail information service in Microsoft Exchange,
you are prompted to enter a password when you start Microsoft Exchange. However,
this password does not prevent others from accessing your personal information
store.

CAUSE
=====

After you install the Microsoft Mail information service, you are prompted to
enter a password the next time you start Microsoft Exchange. This password is
the password for the post office; it is not a password for your personal
information store.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent others from accessing your personal information store, configure
Microsoft Exchange to use a password for your personal folders. To do so, follow
these steps:

1. In Microsoft Exchange, click Services on the Tools menu.

2. Click Personal Folders, and then click Properties.

3. Click Change Password.

4. Type the password for your personal folders in the New Password and Verify
   Password boxes, and then click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you do not configure Microsoft Exchange to use a password for your personal
information store, others can access your personal information store by logging
on to Microsoft Exchange on your computer, or by using Microsoft Exchange to
access your personal information store from another computer on the network (if
your personal information store is located in a shared folder).
