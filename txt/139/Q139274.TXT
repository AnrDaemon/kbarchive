======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you update the system environment variables with a large number of
additions in Control Panel System and restart Windows NT, the following STOP
error message appears:

   STOP: 0xc000021a

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs due to a problem in the SMSS (Session Manager Subsystem)
initialization code.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem in Windows NT version 3.5, choose Last Known Good
when you reboot. This causes the changes you have made to the system environment
not to be available. However, invoking the Last Known Good in Windows NT version
3.51 without a Service Pack added does not work and can corrupt your Windows NT
installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
