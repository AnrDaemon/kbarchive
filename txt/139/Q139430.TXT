TITLE   :Hardware Detection Hangs with Videostar Pro Capture Card
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running the hardware detection portion of Setup from within Windows
95, or when you use the Automatically Detect Installed Hardware option in the
Add New Hardware Wizard, your computer may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you have a Diamond Videostar Pro video capture card
with a built-in MJPEG daughter card installed and you run a video capture
session before you run the hardware detection routine.

When this occurs, the hardware detection routine does not detect the video
adapter driver in memory, causing certain memory areas to be overwritten.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods:

 - Do not run a video capture session before running the hardware detection
   routine.

 - If your computer hangs during Setup, turn it off, wait a few seconds, turn it
   back on, run Setup again, and choose Safe Recovery when you are prompted.

 - Contact Diamond Multimedia Systems, the manufacturer of the Videostar Pro
   capture card, for information about using this card with Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur if you run Windows 95 Setup from MS-DOS because the
video driver is not resident in memory.
