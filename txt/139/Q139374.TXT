KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QJET BUG#: 2388 (3.00)

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Visual C++ (VC++) version 2.x/4.x Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC)
application runs in debug mode with "Database Tracing" on, the following
messages appear in the output window:

   Warning: ODBC Success With Info, Driver's SQLSetConnectOption failed
   State:IM006,Native:0,Origin:[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager]

   Driver not capable
   State:S1C00,Native:84,Origin:[Microsoft][ODBC Driver pack 2.0 Driver]

CAUSE
=====

There is a bug in the Microsoft Desktop Database Drivers Pack 3.0. The driver
generates a message with "ODBC Driver Pack 2.0 Driver" in it rather than "ODBC
Driver pack 3.0 Driver."

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no workaround. You can simply ignore it. Use the 32-bit ODBC
Administrator to make sure you are using the version 3.x desktop database
drivers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ODBC Database Driver Pack 3.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
