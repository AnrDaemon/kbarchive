The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On multimedia enhanced IBM-compatible computers, (computers that have a sound
card and speakers), Mail for Windows supports substituting a .WAV file for the
standard beep that is played in the PC speaker when the spooler detects new
mail.

To enable this option, from the Mail menu, choose Options. Then select New Mail
and Sound Chime.

NOTE: Microsoft Mail for Windows MailBeep can still function under Microsoft
Windows 95, but configuring the custom sound file requires a different
procedure.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows 3.1, the WIN.INI file parameter can list a custom sound for New Mail
notification using the following syntax:

   [Sounds]
   MailBeep=<valid path>\<soundfile>.WAV,MailBeep

In addition, the following line should exist in the MSMAIL.INI file under the
[Microsoft Mail] section:

   [Microsoft Mail]
   MailBeep=<valid path>\<soundfile>.WAV

Microsoft Windows 95 moves the MailBeep entry in the WIN.INI file (if one exists)
to the following registry key every time you exit Microsoft Windows 95:

   HKey_Current_User\AppEvents\Schemes\Apps\.Default\MailBeep\.Current

In addition to the registry entry, the following line must exist in the
MSMAIL.INI file under the [Microsoft Mail] section:

   [Microsoft Mail]
   MailBeep=<anything, but not NULL>

Configuring a Custom Sound for Mail under Microsoft Windows 95
--------------------------------------------------------------

It is not recommended that the registry be edited directly. When you run Mail for
Windows under Microsoft Windows 95, the following steps are recommended to
assign a custom .WAV sound for New Mail notification:

1. Edit the MSMAIL.INI file, and ensure that only the following MailBeep entry
   exists under the [Microsoft Mail] section:

   MailBeep=x

2. Edit the WIN.INI file. Add the following entry under the [Sounds] section:

   " MailBeep=<validpath>\<wavefilename>.WAV,MailBeep" (without the
   quotation marks)

3. Shutdown Microsoft Windows 95.

4. Restart Microsoft Windows 95.

5. Restart Mail
