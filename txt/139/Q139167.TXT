TITLE   :System Agent Icon Does Not Appear on Taskbar
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the System Agent component of Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95,
the System Agent icon may not appear on the taskbar when you restart your
computer. When this occurs, you cannot start System Agent from the Start menu.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Sage.dll file is missing or damaged. The Sage.dll
file should be located in the Windows\System folder, with a size of 71,680
bytes. If you are using Windows 95 Service Pack 1, the Sage.dll file has a size
of 69,120 bytes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Remove or rename the Sage.dll file in the Windows\System folder.

2. Extract a new copy of the Sage.dll file from the original Microsoft Plus!
   disks or CD-ROM. To do so, insert disk 2 or the CD-ROM in the appropriate
   drive, and then type the following line at an MS-DOS command prompt

   " extract /l <hdisk>:\windows\system <fdisk>:\sage.dll " (without
   the quotation marks)

   where <hdisk> is the drive letter of the hard disk containing the
   Windows folder, and <fdisk> is the drive containing either disk 2 or
   the CD-ROM.

3. Shut down and then restart your computer.
