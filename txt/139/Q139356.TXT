TITLE   :TN3270 Server Service Fails to Start Automatically
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When configuring the TN3270 Server service for automatic startup (within the
Services application in Control Panel), the TN3270 service intermittently fails
to start when Windows NT rebooted.

CAUSE
=====

The TN3270 Server service requires that the SnaBase service has already been
started. However, the TN3270 Setup program does not indicate that SnaBase is a
dependent service within the TN3270 service entry in the Windows NT registry.

While the SnaBase service is dynamically started if an application attempts to
use the SNA API client interfaces (such as, when TN3270 is started), dynamic
startup may not succeed in all cases when Windows NT is rebooted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of the Registry Editor
can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   /SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/TN3270

Add the following entry to the TN3270 Server registry key:

   DependOnService: REG_MULTI_SZ:  Tcpip
                                   SnaBase

NOTE: This problem is fixed in an update to the TN3270 Server SETUP.INF file
which automatically adds the above entry.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
