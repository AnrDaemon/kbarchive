SUMMARY
=======

The DirectDraw object creates DirectDrawSurface, DirectDrawPalette, and
DirectDrawClipper objects. Typically, an application or game will create the
following at initialization time:

 - The main DirectDraw object.

 - A primary DirectDrawSurface with one or more back buffers that are attached
   to the primary surface and are DirectDrawSurfaces.

 - Other miscellaneous DirectDrawSurface(s) as needed.

 - DirectDrawPalette(s) to attach to a surface as needed.

 - DirectDrawClipper(s) to attach to a surface as needed.

At clean-up time, the application or game should call Release() to release each
object in reverse order of creation. A typical procedure to cleanup DirectDraw
would follow this order:

 - Release all DirectDrawClipper(s).

 - Release all DirectDrawPalette(s).

 - Release all miscellaneous DirectDrawSurface(s).

 - Release the primary DirectDrawSurface.

 - Release the main DirectDraw object.

You don't need to release backbuffers explicitly because back buffers are
attached to the primary surface, so they would be released with the primary
buffer.

An application or game can also clean up DirectDraw using a single call to
Release() on the main DirectDraw object. The DirectDraw object, when released,
will release all its associated surfaces, palettes, and clipper objects before
going away.
