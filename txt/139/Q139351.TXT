TITLE   :STOP Msg: c000021a - Using Mandatory Profile w/o Access Rights
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Create a user account and specify that it should use a mandatory profile. Create
the mandatory profile but do not specify that the user just created should be
allowed to use it.

When you log in, using an account that attempts to use a mandatory profile it
does not have privilege for, an error message appears (correctly) saying you
cannot logon as the account does not have access rights to the profile. However
a few seconds later, the following STOP message appears:

   STOP: c000021a

CAUSE
=====

During logon processing, Winlogon detects the account does not have access
rights to the mandatory profile assigned to that user. Because the user is not
allowed to login without a valid mandatory profile, logoff processing is
initiated. During this logoff processing, Windows NT attempts to reference the
mandatory profile, which fails because the mandatory profile was never loaded in
the first place and this causes a memory access violation which results in the
STOP Message.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack and
