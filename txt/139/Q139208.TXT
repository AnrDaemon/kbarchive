SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an X25 Ndiswan driver that uses TAPI (Telephony APIs) for its
configuration, unpredictable behavior occurs when you attempt to view the
configuration of the X25 port using the Status button in RASPhone while a RAS
connection is active on the port.

CAUSE

This problem occurs because the status of the X25 port is not returned correctly
by Rastapi.dll when it attempts to read the X25 port configuration structure.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.
