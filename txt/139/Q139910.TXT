TITLE   :Error 6118: "The List of Servers for This Workgroup..."
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you issue a NET VIEW command from the MS-DOS prompt, the following error
message appears:

   Error 6118: The list of servers for this workgroup is not currently
   available.

If you try to browse in Windows 3.1 File Manager or Print Manager, no browse list
is available.

CAUSE
=====

Your workgroup name is different than your domain name.

The NET VIEW command sends out a Status Query (0x03) to the client computer's
workgroup name. Even if your client computer is not a member of a workgroup, the
workgroup name is queried. If your client computer is a member of a domain, the
domain name is queried. If your workgroup name is different than your domain
name, the browse master never responds and the 6118 error appears.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the SYSTEM.INI file in the network directory (usually C:\NET), do NOT edit
the Windows SYSTEM.INI file (usually in the C:\WINDOWS directory).

In the [network] section you will find entries for "workgroup=" and
"logondomain=." These entries should be the same, both using the domain name.
