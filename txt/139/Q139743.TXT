SYMPTOMS

When you adjust the free space on removable media in DriveSpace or DriveSpace 3,
you may receive either or both of the following error messages:

   - Error- Windows cannot work with drive <X> because application is
   currently using that drive.
   ID Number: DRVSPACE 312

   - Error- Windows cannot change the estimated compression ratio for drive
   <X> because it cannot find the compressed volume file for drive
   <X>.

Next, you receive either of the following error messages:

   - DRVSPACE caused a general protection fault in module USER.EXE at
   0003:00006e7c.

   - DRVSPACE caused a general protection fault in module DRVSPACE.EXE at
   0004:00003776.


CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur for any of the following reasons:

 - The removable media is not formatted properly.

 - The host for the compressed drive is no longer available.

 - The removable media is no longer accessible because of a hardware failure or
   because it has been removed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, check to make sure that:

   Explorer).

2. The host drive is available.

3. The removable media is properly formatted.
