======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you migrate from a Novell Network to a Microsoft Network, you may have
difficulty getting your Intel NetPortExpress XL print server to service print
request, even if the Windows NT server is running File and Print Services for
Netware (FPNW).

MORE INFORMATION
================

An Intel NetportExpress XL on a Novell Network is generally configured to use
IPX/SPX. To use this print server on a Microsoft Network, it must be configured
to support NetBIOS.

NOTE: For the NetportExpress XL to work on the Microsoft Network, the Application
Code and RBL code must be version 3.04 or later.

For detailed information contact Intel FaxBack service at (800) 525-3019 and
request Document 6072, or Intel technical support at (503) 264-7000.

After upgrading the NetPort software, you must configure the Windows NT server:

1. Create a user account and directory for the NETPORT.

2. Insure the Password is blank and that the "User Must Change Password at Next
   Logon" is NOT selected.

3. The account name should be NETPORT and the Shared directory should be
   NETPORT.

4. The NETPORT user account needs Read-Only access to the directory \NETPORT.

Now, install the NETPORT Manager software. It can be installed on a workstation
as well as the server. Follow the instructions on the disk. This is the software
for configuring all of the NETPORT print servers.

Complete the following steps for configuring the Netport with Netport Manager:

1. Start Netport Manager and select a NetportExpress print server from the list.
   Choose Configure.

NOTE: The NetBEUI protocol is required to initialize the Intel NetportExpress
Print Server hardware if you are installing on a Microsoft network.

2. If you are prompted, fill in the Set Remote Boot Load Servers window: If
   there are buttons for Server Type, select NetBIOS. Select a domain from the
   list, or type one in. Select a shared directory to connect to from the list,
   or type one in. The name must be in the form:

   \\<server_name>\<share_name>

   This should be the same as the user name of the account created on the Windows
   NT server. Choose OK.

   NOTE: There may be a delay while the NetportExpress updates its RBL
   information.

3. Choose Protocols, select Windows NT, Choose Configure (this is not available
   prior to version 3.04)

4. Fill in the "Configure Microsoft...Print Server Window". Choose Use Defaults
   to accept the default choices or select a domain for print services from the
   list (or type one in). For each port, enter a name and description.

5. If you want to use IP, Choose Set IP Address. Either select "Dynamically
   Configure" (requires DHCP), or fill the correct IP address information. Exit
   Netport Manager.

6. Now you can start Print Manager to create the printer. Make sure the share
   name is the same as the printer name.

The NetportExpress XL is manufactured by Intel, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
