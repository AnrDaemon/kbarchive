TITLE   :SMS Views Created By SMSVIEW Have Incorrect Results
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsmsUtil smsutil

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the views created by SMSVIEW.EXE version 1.1, reports and queries
you run against these views produce results that are inconsistent with the
results returned by the Systems Management Server Administrator Tool.

CAUSE
=====

The problem with the views has to do with the necessity to use an outer join
when joining the MachineDataTable with the appropriate common or specific table.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has modified the files, SMSVIEW.EXE and VIEWDLL.DLL, to correct this
problem. To avoid use of outer joins, the new view generating program adds a
"null" row to each of the data tables.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
