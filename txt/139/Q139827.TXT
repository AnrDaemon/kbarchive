SYMPTOMS
========

After you compress the hard disk on your IBM ThinkPad computer, the IBM ThinkPad
Hibernation file may no longer work.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the compression driver (Dblspace.bin or
Drvspace.bin) is not loaded in memory when the ThinkPad computer attempts to
load the Hibernation file from the compressed volume. Because the compression
driver is not loaded, the compressed volume cannot be read and the Hibernation
file cannot be located.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this situation, increase the size of the host drive (thereby
decreasing the size of the compressed drive) by an amount equal to the amount of
RAM in the computer. Then, change the following line in the Autoexec.bat file
from

   c:\thinkpad\ps2 hfile c

to

   c:\thinkpad\ps2 hfile <host drive letter>

where <host drive letter> is the letter of the host drive.
