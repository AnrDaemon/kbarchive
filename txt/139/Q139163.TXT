SUMMARY
=======

The system requirement information located on the side of the product box for
Encarta World Atlas lists the incorrect video resolution information.

The box states:

   VGA video adapter for 16-color support, or higher resolution for 256- color
   support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The images and video clips in Encarta 96 World Atlas are actually stored at a
24-bit color depth and will look their best when your display is set to True
Color (24-bit).

The minimum requirement is actually a driver supporting at least 256 colors.
