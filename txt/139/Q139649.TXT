TITLE   :Windows NT Service Can't Connect to Network Printer on 3.51
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Windows NT service attempts to connect to a network printer resource while
running on Windows NT 3.51, the connection attempt fails.

If the service attempts to call CreateDC on the "winspool" driver, the call fails
with rc=126 (specified module could not be found). The actual error observed by
the user will vary depending on how the service handles this error condition.

This problem occurs with any Windows NT service which attempts to connect to a
network print resource, including the NetSoft NS/Print Server for Windows NT.

CAUSE
=====

If the printer is remote, the spooler passes an invalid parameter causing the
service's CreateDC call to fail.


WORKAROUND
==========

The service can still connect to any local printer resources. So, to workaround
the problem, the administrator must create local printers using the Print
Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
