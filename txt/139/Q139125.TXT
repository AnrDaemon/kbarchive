TITLE   :Windows 95 SnaBase Uses Taskbar Even When Not Shown
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure the SnaBase process included with the SNA Server Windows 95
client to use the taskbar, Windows 95 moves all other taskbar icons to the left
if the taskbar is full.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Windows 95 SnaBase process is not properly handling its task bar
icon when it is configured to be hidden.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the SnaBase service to hide itself and never add itself to
the task bar.

This update also fixes other small user interface (UI) related bugs:

 - The default menu option is now highlighted (only if no icon is on the task
   bar).

 - The configuration dialog box is now displayed close to the current cursor
   location instead of the bottom right corner .

 - The SnaBase makes sure that the task bar does not block any part of the
   configuration dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
