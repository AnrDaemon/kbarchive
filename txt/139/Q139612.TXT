TITLE   :TCP/IP-32 3.11b NET LOGON to Domain Fails Across Router
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::3.11b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 client running Microsoft TCP/IP-32 3.11b
attempts to log on to a Windows NT domain, using NET LOGON command from the
command prompt across routers. The attempt fails and the following warning
message appears:

   You are logged on, but have not been validated by a server.

CAUSE
=====

The logon fails because the NET LOGON command attempts to resolve the domain
name by using only b-node broadcasts. A query request for the domain <1C>
SMB is not sent to the WINS server, nor is the local LMHOSTS file parsed after
the three b-node broadcasts for Logon request SMB fail.

This problem does not occur when the Windows for Workgroups client logs on to the
domain using the Enterprise logon option under Control Panel Networks in Windows
for Workgroups3.11.

RESOLUTION
==========

The above problem is fixed by updating the following WFW 3.11 files from the NT
Server 3.51 CD or NT 4.0 Server CD.

   NDIS.386
   NET.EXE
   NET.MSG
   NETAPI.DLL
   NWNBLINK.386
   VNETSUP.386
   VREDIR.386
   VSERVER.386

The updated files address specific problems related to Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 and also provide the following:

 - Support for inter-network browsing (they allow browsing to Windows NT domains
   from subnets that have only Windows for Workgroups clients).

 - A fix for problems using the NWLink protocol with the Ethernet_II frame type
   when connecting to a Windows NT Server.

Files can be found on \CLIENTS\WFW\UPDATE directory on NT 3.51 Server CD and on
\CLIENTS\UPDATE.WFW directory on NT 4.0 Server CD.

WHEN USING the NT 3.5 Server CD take the following steps :

To work around this problem, either use Control Panel Network to log on or
replace Microsoft TCP/IP-32 version 3.11b with version 3.11A.

NOTE: The TCP/IP-32 version 3.11A drivers can be found on the Windows NT 3.5
Server CD, in the CLIENTS\TCP32WFW\DISKS directory.

1. From the Network group, run Network Setup.

2. Choose the Drivers button.

   Under Network Drivers, you will see your Network Interface Card (NIC) and the
   network protocols used on that NIC.

3. Select TCP/IP-32 3.11b.

4. Choose the Setup button and write down all of your TCP/IP-32 3.11b
   configuration information.

5. Choose the Cancel button to return to the Network Drivers dialog box.

6. Choose the Remove button and then the Yes button to confirm.

7. Choose the Add Protocol button.

8. Select Unlisted or Updated Protocol and Choose the OK button.

9. In the Install Driver dialog box, enter the path to the TCP/IP-32 3.11
   files.

   You should then see Microsoft TCP/IP-32 3.11 in the Unlisted or Updated
   Protocol dialog.

10. Choose the OK button.

   You should then see Microsoft TCP/IP-32 3.11 in the Network Drivers dialog
   box.

11. Choose the Setup button and configure TCP/IP-32 3.11 based on the
   information you wrote down in step 4.

12. Choose the Close button to exit the Network Divers dialog box.

13. Choose the OK button to exit the Network Setup dialog box.

   Setup will modify system files.

14. Choose the OK button.

   Network Setup prompts you to reboot.

15. Choose the Restart Computer button.
