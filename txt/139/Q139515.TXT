SUMMARY
=======

When you run Disk Defragmenter on a compressed volume, the Show Details screen
shows the system cluster size changing from a uniform size to varying sizes
after Disk Defragmenter is 50 percent finished.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run Disk Defragmenter on a compressed volume, you see uniform boxes on
the Show Details screen until Disk Defragmenter is 50 percent finished. After 50
percent, you see boxes of various sizes. This occurs because Disk Defragmenter
is defragmenting the actual physical hard disk during the first 50 percent, and
the compressed volume during the second 50 percent.

You see boxes of different sizes because of the way Disk Defragmenter reflects
how files are stored on an uncompressed drive and on a DriveSpace compressed
volume.
