TITLE   :Unable to Change Domain Name of Windows NT BDC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you change the domain name of the primary domain controller (PDC) in
Control Panel Network and then attempt to change the domain name of the backup
domain controller (BDC), the following error message appears:

   You already have a connection to the domain. You must disconnect before
   joining the domain.

When you attempt to use the previous domain name for the PDC, the following error
message appears:

   The domain name entered is already in use by another computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, disconnect any connections you have from the BDC to the
PDC before you change the domain name of the BDC.

NOTE: This only works if you change to a new domain name. That is, a previously
non-existing domain.
