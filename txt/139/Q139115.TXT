The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

SNA Server version 2.11 supports the "Fujitsu Network Architecture" (FNA) and
"Hitachi Network Architecture" (HNA) variants to IBM SNA. Support for these
alternate SNA protocols is enabled adding the following registry keys:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/SnaServr/Parameters

      FNA_SUPPORT: REG_SZ: <value>   (to enable FNA)

   -or-

      HNA_SUPPORT: REG_SZ: <value>   (to enable HNA)

where <value> can be set to anything. The presence of this registry key
enables this support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If SNA Server is communicating to a host system which is running Fujitsu Network
Architecture (FNA) protocol, the following sense code errors may occur if
FNA_SUPPORT is not enabled:

   80050001: No session: SNA Server received a request other than
   session control request when no LU-LU session was active

If SNA Server is communicating to a host system which is running Hitachi Network
Architecture (HNA) protocol and HNA_SUPPORT is not enabled, an out- of-chain
CANCEL message sent to a type 3 Printer LU will be rejected by SNA Server rather
than being sent to the printer application.
