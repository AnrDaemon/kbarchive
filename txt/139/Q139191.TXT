SYMPTOMS
========

If you click the Play Through Lesson button when a video is playing, the video
stops and rewinds. After the video rewinds the first lesson becomes selected and
the lesson does not play.

If no video is playing, clicking the Play Through Lesson rewinds the entire
lesson video and begins playing the lesson from the first step, and plays all
the videos in succession.


RESOLUTION
==========

The Play Trough Lesson button within a lesson is a special button called a
toggle. A toggle is a button that has two possible options.

Use the different toggle functions to control the lessons.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Play Through Lesson button either stops playing a video and rewinds it, or
rewinds the entire lesson and begins video replay. The action taken is
determined by the state the video is in when the Play Through Lesson is
clicked.

The Play Through Lesson button begins playing the first video of a lesson and
goes through all the videos in the lesson only if no video is playing when you
click it. Otherwise, it stops the currently playing video and rewinds it, and
highlights the first step of the lesson.
