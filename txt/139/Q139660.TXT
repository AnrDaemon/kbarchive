-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run one of the products listed above on a monitor that has a
screen resolution of less than 640 x 480 pixels, the program doesn't display
correctly.

This is most apparent if you try to run Magic School Bus (MSB) Human Body on a
computer with an Apple 12-inch RGB monitor that supports a maximum resolution of
512 x 384. You are not able to see the entire program screen with monitors with
less than a 640 x 480 resolution.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no known workaround for this problem. MSB Human Body for the Macintosh
does not run properly on any monitor that does not support a resolution of at
least 640 x 480.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine your current video resolution, do the following:

1. On the Apple Menu, select Control Panels.

2. Open Monitors control panel.

3. Click Options.

4. Verify that a monitor setting of at least 640 x 480 is available and
   selected.

5. If a resolution of 640 x 480 is not available, contact the manufacturer of
   your monitor or video card.
