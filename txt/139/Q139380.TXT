TITLE   :Multihomed WINS Server Replication Partner Failures
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After setting up replication between multi-homed WINS servers, some data may not
replicate properly and the following error may be logged in the event log:

   Event 4102: "Connection was aborted by remote client".

CAUSE
=====

When configuring replication partners, only one IP address may be entered for a
given partner. If you attempt to add another IP address for the same replication
partner, WINSADMN realizes that this is the same system as the one previously
already entered, and switches the IP address in the list to the one that the
WINS server is bound to on the remote machine.

However, when replication actually occurs, Windows Sockets is the interface used.
The outgoing pull request uses socket()/bind()/connect() calls, and on the bind
it specifies INADDR_ANY. This means that the outgoing call can be sourced from
any IP address on a computer. If it's sourced from any IP address other than the
one that the WINS server is bound to, replication fails. The event log will
contain "Connection aborted by remote client." The replication fails because the
WINS server being contacted compares the source address of the incoming request
to its list of authorized replication partners.

RESOLUTION
==========

WINSADMN.EXE (the WINS manager) has been modified to allow each IP address on a
multi-homed machine to be entered as a replication partner on the other machines
it replicates with. Each IP address should be entered as a replication partner
on all machines that will replicate with a multi- homed computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
