SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the IDE CD-ROM (ATAPI 1.2) driver, Windows NT does not
recognize a Wearnes CDD-120 CD-ROM drive even though the Windows NT Hardware
Compatibility List (HCL) lists this drive as a supported ATAPI 1.2 compliant IDE
CD-ROM drive.

CAUSE
=====

The Wearnes CDD-120 CD-ROM drive with Firmware versions 1.0 or 2.1 is not
supported in Windows NT.

You can find the (http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/the)
firmware version number on the white label of the power connector. For example,
x.xx in the following number represents the firmware version:

   7031P-x.xx

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade your CD-ROM drive to one of the following
firmware versions:

   1.1H
   1.1J
   2.1A
   2.1B
