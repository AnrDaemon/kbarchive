The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT, your IDE CD-ROM drive is not recognized.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your IDE CD-ROM drive is connected to the IDE
interface on a Creative Labs Sound Blaster sound card and the IDE interface on
the sound card is not ATAPI 1.2 compliant.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Connect your CD-ROM drive to an available port on your computer's IDE
   controller.

   NOTE: Your computer's IDE controller and the CD-ROM drive must be ATAPI 1.2
   compliant.

2. Disable the IDE interface on the Sound Blaster sound card. For information
   about configuring or disabling your CD-ROM drive or your Sound Blaster sound
   card, consult your hardware documentation or contact your hardware
   manufacturer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are a number of different models of Creative Labs Sound Blaster sound
cards with different CD-ROM interfaces. If you are uncertain what model of card
you have or what type of CD-ROM drive is attached to the sound card, the CD-ROM
interface on the sound card is labeled with the CD- ROM drive type it is
designed to support.


Sound Blaster sound cards are manufactured by Creative Labs, a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
