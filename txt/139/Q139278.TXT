SYMPTOMS
========

Regini is a character-based batch file that you can use to add keys to the
Windows NT Registry by specifying a Registry script. If you use the example
included in "Help for Windows NT Resource Kit\Registry Tools\RegIni.EXE:
Registry Change by script," the respective registry value do not appear in the
Registry. You receive one of two different responses when you run Regini:

   C:\users\default>regini srv.ini
   00 0000 KeyName: \registry\machine\system\currentcontrolset\services
   \lanmanserver\parametersCreated value for Key: \registry\machine\system
   \currentcontrolset\services\lanmanserver\parameters\DiskSpaceThreshhold =
   'REG_DWORD 0x00000000'

   -or-

   C:\users\default>regini srv.ini
   00 0000 KeyName: \registry\machine\system\currentcontrolset\services
   \lanmanserver\parameters

The first response indicates that the value was added to respective registry
subkey successfully.

The second response indicates the operation was not successful and that the value
was not added to registry.

NOTE: In the above examples, the "srv.ini" file is the name of the script you
created. You can use any filename, with or without extension.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the text editor you used to create your script does not
put a carriage return at the end of the last line.

RESOLUTION
==========

Open your script and make sure there is a carriage return at the end of each
line.
