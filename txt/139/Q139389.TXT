The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro allows the use of OLE controls in your applications. These
controls are available from a variety of sources. Often, it is necessary to
determine the names of the properties, methods, and events available in an OLE
control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This information is available through the OLE control's type library, which was
created by the .ocx developer. Visual FoxPro allows you to read this information
programmatically by using the AMEMBERS() function.

Steps to Determine Events, Methods, and Properties Exposed in an .Ocx File
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add an OLE Container control to the form.

3. On the Insert menu, click Control, and select the desired control.

4. Save and run the form. Minimize the form.

5. In the Command window, type:

      =AMEMBERS(aType, formname.olecontrol1,1)
      _SCREEN.SHOW
      DISPLAY MEMORY LIKE aType

The array containing the exposed properties and methods of the .ocx should be
displayed.
