SUMMARY
=======

The information in this article explains how to install the multimedia programs
listed at the top of this article directly to your hard drive. This lets you run
the program without using the compact disc.

NOTE: Installing any Microsoft program as a network installation without a
multiple workstation license agreement is violation of the Microsoft Licensing
Agreement.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The procedure offers improved performance, but requires a large amount of free
hard drive space.

Program              Required Drive Space
-------              --------------------

Bookshelf 1995       570 MB
Encarta 1995         645 MB

NOTE: You should only use this procedure on computers with large-capacity hard
drives in situations where fast performance is critical.

Installing The Compact Disc
---------------------------

To install the entire compact disk to your hard drive, do the following:

1. Open the compact disc and double-click the Installer or Setup icon. This
   places the program and system files onto your hard drive.

2. When the installation completes, locate the Data folder on the compact disc
   and copy the following data folders to your hard drive.

   Product           Data Folders
   --------          ------------

   Bookshelf 1995    Books
   Encarta 1995      Encarta Files

3. Drag these folders directly to your hard drive. The copy process takes some
   time. These folders must remain directly on the hard drive; they cannot be
   placed within other folders.

4. Rename your hard drive. Name the hard drive using the exact same name as the
   program compact disc.

The multimedia program now runs on your computer without requiring the compact
disc.
