TITLE   :Using High Contrast Display Scheme Hides Part of Window

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a display scheme that causes the menu bar in a Windows- based
program to wrap to more than one line, you may not be able to see the lower
portion of the program's window.

For example, this behavior is noticeable if you run Microsoft Calculator in
Standard view with the "High Contrast Black (extra large)" or "High Contrast
White (extra large)" display scheme.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when a Windows-based program does not correctly compute the
size of its dialog box window. For example, Calculator (Calc.exe) does not
resize its window properly when a large menu font causes the menu bar to wrap to
more than one line.

This problem may occur with any display scheme that sets the menu font size to a
setting greater than 19.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem in Calculator, view the calculator in Scientific
view, or use a different display scheme.

If you experience this problem in a program other than Calculator and using a
different display scheme is not an option, contact the program's manufacturer
for information about a possible workaround.
