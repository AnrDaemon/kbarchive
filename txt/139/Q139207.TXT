TITLE   :S3 Driver Doesn't Correctly Support 72Hz on Some IBM PS/2 Models
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdisplay

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The S3 video driver included with Windows NT version 3.51 does not correctly
implement the 72Hz refresh rate when used with the onboard S3 based video on IBM
PS/2 Model 76i and Model 77i computers.

Attempting to install the driver and invoking the "Test" option in the Display
section of Control Panel results in the test bitmap appearing for a short time,
after which the image degrades and the screen turns black.

The driver functions correctly when a 60Hz refresh rate is selected.

Depending on the capabilities of your monitor, you may or may not see this
behavior.


CAUSE
=====

When Windows NT attempts to set the video mode to 72hz, it incorrectly sets it
to 97hz Vertical and 75mhz Horizontal. The standard for 72hz is 72hz Vertical
and 48mhz Horizontal.

RESOLUTION
==========

A new version of the S3.SYS driver is available which corrects this problem. It
is available in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
