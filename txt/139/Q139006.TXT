SUMMARY
=======

A majority of the labs in Mastering Visual FoxPro are self-contained labs; that
is, they do not rely on any other labs. However, there are four Labs in Chapter
3, Form Designer, that state: "If you need to see how...refer to an earlier
lab...<name of the lab>". To find a referenced lab, use the FIND tab on
the Navigator. Type the name of the lab mentioned (and uncheck all the options
except for labs). The lab will appear in the FIND dialog box. To launch the
selected lab, double-click it.
