======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

SNA Server can be configured for Dependent LU 6.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Pages 111-115 of the SNA Server 2.1 or 2.11 Admin Guide show a comprehensive
Independent LU6.2 configuration. Dependent LU6.2 is the same with the following
differences:

Dependent LU 6.2
----------------

 - Relies on the existence of an SSCP (System Services Control Point) at the
   host end (VTAM).

 - The VTAM locaddr entry for the APPC LU must be greater than 0. In SNA Server,
   the local address is configured in the Local APPC LU dialog within SNA Admin.
   For example: DANL109 LU LOCADDR=9,DLOGMOD=APPCMODE

 - You must select "LU 6.2 Type: Dependent" under SNA Server Admin local LU
   properties dialog box.

 - Mode definition (Both SNA Server and the host's mode must match)

    - PSERVIC must be: PSERVIC=X'0602000000000000002C00'

    - Parallel session Limit must be 1.

Independent LU 6.2
------------------

 - Does not rely on an SSCP (i.e. VTAM). Independent LU6.2 is supported directly
   between SNA PU2.1 capable nodes.

 - Locaddr in LU Definition must be 0. For example: DANL112 LU
   LOCADDR=0,DLOGMOD=#INTER

 - You must select "LU 6.2 Type: Independent" under SNA Server Admin local LU
   properties dialog box.

 - Mode definition (Both SNA Server and the host's mode must match)

    - PSERVIC must be: PSERVIC=X'0602000000000000002F00'

    - Parallel session limit is not limited to 1, but can be 1.
