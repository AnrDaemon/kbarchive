The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

SUMMARY
=======

To set the Remote Access Service (RAS) Server Port Speed (bps) field displayed
in the Port Status dialog box of RasAdmin (RASADMIN.EXE), you must modify the
INITIALBPS parameter in the
%SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\RAS\SERIAL.INI file.

To view the Port Speed (bps) field in the Port Status dialog box:

1. Run RasAdmin.

2. From the Server menu, choose Communication Ports.

3. Choose Port Status.

To change the Port Speed on your RAS server follow the instructions below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT RAS sets two bits per second (bps) speeds for each RAS serial port:

 - The carrier bps speed.

 - The connect bps speed also referred to as port speed.

The carrier bps speed is the speed is read from the MAXCARRIERBPS parameter in
your modem's section of the %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\RAS\MODEM.INF file. The
carrier bps set the speed at which the two connected modems send data over the
telephone line.

The connect bps speed, or port speed, is the speed at which data is transferred
between your modem and the serial port on your computer (also known as the Data
Terminal Equipment [DTE] to Data Communication Equipment [DCE] bps transfer
rate).

While the carrier bps used by the RAS server modem may be different for each RAS
connection due to the connecting modem capabilities, line noise, etc., the RAS
server connect bps is always initialized at the same speed. The connect bps
speed used by the RAS server is read from the MAXCONNECTBPS parameter in your
modem's section of the %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\RAS\MODEM.INF file when you install
your modem. The speed is then stored in the INITIALBPS parameter of the
SERIAL.INI file. The RAS server service then uses the INITIALBPS parameter in
SERIAL.INI to initialize the port speed whenever the RAS server service is
started.

To Change the Port Speed (bps):

NOTE: Verify that your modem and serial port support the Port Speed value you
intend to set.

1. Load the %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\RAS\SERIAL.INI into a text editor, for
   example, NOTEPAD.EXE.

2. Change the INITIALBPS parameter to the desired value.

3. Save SERIAL.INI.

4. Run RasAdmin.

5. From the Server menu, choose Stop Remote Access Service.

6. From the Server menu, choose Start Remote Access Service.
