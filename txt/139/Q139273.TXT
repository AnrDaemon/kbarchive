TITLE   :STOP 0x0000000A Using 3Com 3C770 with Compaq and HP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the 3Com 3C770 FDDI adapter driver in Windows NT 3.51 on a Compaq
ProSignia 300 or 500, ProLiant 1500 or 4500, or Deskpro/XL computer, or on some
Hewlett-Packard (HP) computers, the following STOP error message appears:

   STOP: 0x0000000A

CAUSE
=====

Bus timing can lead to a hardware malfunction on the 3C770. 3Com has determined
that there is no software workaround and has revised the hardware to fix this
problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

According to the latest Windows NT 3.51 Hardware Compatibility List, the 3Com
3C770 network adapter driver is not supported on these Compaq computers. Do not
use the FDDILink adapter in any of these computers.

You can obtain the revised adapter and driver from 3Com Technical Support at
(800) 876-3266.

For other Compaq PC models, run the adapter's diagnostic external loopback test
to confirm interoperability.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Compaq's EISA-PCI bridge chipset's large amount of wait-states causes 3Com's
adapter to skip 4-byte at certain burst cycle. With NetBEUI, this manifests into
a data-corruption problem on the Compaq ProSignia 500 computer. The 3C770 driver
included on the Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server CD-ROM disks in the
\DRVLIB\NETCARD\xX86\3C770 subdirectory is designed for use with only Windows NT
3.5 and not in Windows NT 3.51. Updates to this adapter will be listed in future
Hardware Compatibility Lists. The symptom mentioned above does not occur on 3Com
network adapters with revision 08-0015-002-REV5A or higher.

of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
