The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can manage the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) and Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) services on a standalone (non-domain) Windows NT
server by using a non-administrator domain user account that has administrator
privileges only on the standalone Windows NT server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To manage the WINS and DHCP services, you must have administrator privileges on
the server running these services. Your logon account must be added to the local
Administrators group on the standalone server. You can then manage these
services with only domain user rights (that is, you don't have to have
administrator rights on the domain you are a member of). You can also manage
multiple domains in this way if trusts are established between these domains.
