TITLE   :PRB: Specifying Table Name with Column Name in MFC DAO
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0,4.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbDAOsearch kbDatabase kbMFC kbVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you add a table name qualifier to a column name in the DoFieldExchange of
your CDaoRecordset-derived class where one is not required to resolve ambiguity,
an exception will be thrown when the recordset is opened. The exception
indicates that:

   GetRows failed. The requested column is not a member of this recordset.

CAUSE
=====

Specifying table name qualifiers for columns that are not ambiguous (where the
column name is sufficient to uniquely identify the column) causes the assignment
of retrieved data to bound columns that occurs in the GetRows function to fail.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove unnecessary table name qualifiers to avoid this behavior.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
