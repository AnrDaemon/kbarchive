SUMMARY
=======


When you set up an MS-DOS or Windows client computer for Systems Management
Server, a call to CLIENT.BAT is added to the client computer's AUTOEXEC.BAT
file. This article explains how you can control where to place the call of
CLIENT.BAT in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Systems Management Server Client Setup reads AUTOEXEC.BAT and searches for the
WIN (WIN.COM) statement. It does this so it can place a necessary call to
CLIENT.BAT before Windows is started by the "WIN" command. Sometimes because of
the need to load TSR's or other programs after CLIENT.BAT is called, but before
Windows loads, CLIENT.BAT's call must be moved ahead in AUTOEXEC.BAT.

At the point in AUTOEXEC.BAT, where you want to call CLIENT.BAT, place a call to
an empty batch file named WIN.BAT. Create an empty batch file called WIN.BAT,
and place it in a directory not included in the path (if the directory is in the
path earlier than Windows, then Windows may never load). For example:

1. Create the host directory:

      md c:\foolit

2. Create WIN.BAT:

      echo exit >c:\foolit\win.bat

3. Place the following in AUTOEXEC.BAT:

      call c:\foolit\win

Systems Management Server Client Setup detects "call c:\foolit\win" as the call
to start Windows (using WIN.COM) and automatically places the call to CLIENT.BAT
one line before it.
