SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Windows 95 with a 16-color palette, the "Science" and "60's
USA" screen savers included with Microsoft Plus! do not work in normal or
preview mode. When you use these screen savers, the "Rendering lens" message
does not appear and the screen saver is not visible. However, when you interrupt
the screen saver, the screen is redrawn as if the screen saver were running.

The other screen savers included with Microsoft Plus! work normally in 16-color
mode.

CAUSE
=====

You are using a 16-color palette in Windows 95.

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Display icon.

2. On the Settings tab, change the Color Palette settings from 16 to 256 or
   greater.

3. Click OK.

STATUS
======

Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
