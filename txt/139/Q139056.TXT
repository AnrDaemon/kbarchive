When you promote a Windows NT backup domain controller (BDC) to a primary
domain controller (PDC), the following warning message appears:

   Promoting <servername> will also close client connections to <BDC
   servername> and to the current domain controller (if any).

This warning message is misleading. Client connections (session) made to
the BDC or the PDC before the domain controller promotion are not
terminated. The clients have full access to existing resources and can
establish new drive or printer connections during the domain controller
promotion.

If you did not have an existing session with the domain controller before
the promotion, you are unable to create a session to any of the domain
controllers until you restart the NetLogon services on the domain
controllers.

Additional query words: prodnt dc
