PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Madge Token Ring network adapter in your computer may not work correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The ring speed setting for the network adapter may not match the Windows 95
settings. The Madge Token Ring network adapter does not automatically sense the
network's ring speed. The Windows 95 network driver defaults to a ring speed of
4 Mbps.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the manufacturer-supplied Trspeed.exe tool to set the network adapter's ring
speed. For information about the Trspeed.exe tool, please consult the network
adapter's documentation or manufacturer.

To set the ring speed for the network adapter in Windows 95, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.

2. Click the Madge Token Ring adapter, and then click Properties.

3. On the Advanced tab, click "Force XX Mbits/s" in the Property box, and then
   click the Value box.

   NOTE: If the token ring adapter is set to "Force16=ON" or "Force16=Yes," click
   "Force 16 Mbits/s" in the Property box.

4. In the Value box, click Yes.

5. Click OK, and then restart your computer when you are prompted to do so.
