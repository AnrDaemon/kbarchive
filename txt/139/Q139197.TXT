PRODUCT :Microsoft Mastering Series
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbmmkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Mastering Microsoft Visual FoxPro 3.0, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Mastering Microsoft Visual FoxPro compact disc under Windows
95, the application window may not correctly repaint when another window has
overlapped the application window.

RESOLUTION
==========

When this problem occurs, the easiest way to force the window to repaint
correctly is to minimize the application and then immediately restore it. This
will cause all the windows of the application to be repainted correctly.

To avoid this problem, avoid overlapping other windows on top of the application
window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
