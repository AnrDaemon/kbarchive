SUMMARY
=======

When you use the AT scheduler to run a command prompt operation, the following
error message appears:

   The system cannot find the file specified

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if the command prompt operation specified in the AT command
contains directory names that include spaces. For example, the following AT
command generates the above error:

   AT 12:00 "XCOPY C\Source directory\*.* C:\Destination directory"

Within the AT command, the XCOPY command parses the space in the directory name
as a delimiter between parameters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem,

1. Create a batch file that contains the desired command prompt operation.

2. Specify the batch file as the desired command for the scheduler service to
   run. For example:

   AT 12:00 C:\TEST.BAT

   where TEST.BAT contains the following:

   XCOPY "C:\Source directory\*.*" "C:\Destination directory"
