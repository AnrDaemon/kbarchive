TITLE   :RAS Error: "The communications device attached to port..."
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive one or more occurrences of the following error message in the System
Log of the Windows NT Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 20015
   Source: RemoteAccess
   Description: The communications device attached to port COMX is not
   functioning.

   NOTE: X represents the number of a COM port.

Additionally, the Port Status option of the Remote Access Admin utility reports
the following for the COM port:

   Modem Condition: Hardware failure
   Line Condition: Line non-operational

CAUSE
=====

You have configured RAS to allow dial-in for one or more modems with a device
name equal to 32 characters in length. This problem will likely appear if you
are using a multiport serial adapter and multiple ports are configured for
devices with names equal to 32 characters. The error message may not appear for
all ports configured with a device name equal to 32 characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the device name in %SystemRoot%\system32\ras\MODEM.INF so that it is no
more than 31 characters in length. Although the documented limit to the length
of a device name in MODEM.INF is 32 characters, using less than 32 characters
solves the problem. Use the following steps to workaround this problem:

1. Open %SystemRoot%\system32\ras\MODEM.INF in a text editor.

2. Find the section in MODEM.INF that corresponds to your modem. This section
   will be identified by the name of the modem enclosed in square brackets.

3. Modify the name of the modem so it is no more than 31 characters in length.
   The open and close square bracket characters do not count as one of the 31
   characters.

4. Save MODEM.INF.

5. Open the Network section of Control Panel.

6. Configure the Remote Access Service.

7. Choose the Configure button and select the new device name entered in step 3,
   then choose OK.

8. Choose Continue, then choose OK.

9. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
