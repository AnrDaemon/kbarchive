TITLE   :Problems Using TekRam VLB Controller with Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a TekRam VLB controller with Windows 95, you may experience
performance or MS-DOS Compatibility mode issues with hard disks with a capacity
greater than 528 megabytes (MB).

When you experience such issues, the Ios.log file may contain the following
information:

   ESDI sector mismatch
   Unit number 02 going through real mode drivers.
   Unit number 03 going through real mode drivers.
   Unit number 04 going through real mode drivers.


CAUSE
=====

The Esdi_506.pdr driver supports only standard INT13 functions. It does not
support sector remapping. This behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable protected-mode support for the TekRam VLB controller, please contact
TekRam to inquire about obtaining a Windows 95-compatible driver for the
controller.

For additional information about using the TekRam VLB disk controller, please
consult the controller's documentation or manufacturer.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use a TekRam VLB controller with hard disks with a capacity greater
than 528 MB, the track remapping and enhanced INT13 options must be enabled on
the controller. Such translation schemes are not compatible with the Windows 95
Esdi_506.pdr driver. protected-mode support for this controller is limited to
hard disks with a capacity less than 528 MB.
