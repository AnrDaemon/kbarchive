TITLE   :PC NTMMTA: Err Msg: Error OS/2 Error Code 38
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Windows NT Multitasking MTA (NT MMTA), and you create
and start a service, you will get the following error when you try to monitor
the instance:

   ERROR OS/2 ERROR CODE 38

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the Windows NT OS/2 subsystem is trying to launch the
MS-DOS or native OS/2 version of EXTERNAL.EXE or DISPATCH.EXE as a service.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Microsoft Mail Service Manager, Edit Service dialog box, ensure that the
Executable Path parameter displays the correct path to the EXTERNAL.EXE or
DISPATCH.EXE file that was included with the NT MMTA. These files are normally
located under the \MAILEXE\EXTERNAL.NT or \MAILEXE\DIRSYNC.NT subdirectory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS-DOS version of EXTERNAL.EXE and DISPATCH.EXE are not bound applications.
This means full functionality is available only under their native environment,
and somewhat limited functionality in other environments, such as the Windows NT
OS/2 subsystem. As a result, the Mail External program and Dispatch will not
operate as a service under the Windows NT OS/2 subsystem.

For additional information about the supported options of the Mail External
program under Windows NT, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q118620 Support of EXTERNAL.EXE under Windows NT

A brief explanation of "Error OS/2 error code <code>" can be found in the
Windows NT "Resource Kit" version 3.5 Volume 3, page 278.
