TITLE   :PC NTMMTA: DISPATCH.EXE Using Single Postoffice Instance
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Dispatch service included with the Mail Multitasking MTA for
Windows NT (NT MMTA), and the service is configured with the Single Postoffice
Instance option, you will receive the following error in the Monitor window or
the DISPATCH.LOG:

   Dynamic connections could not be established

However, the Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) process operates successfully
as indicated by the following messages in the log file:

   Checking the process table on <NETWORK>\<POSTOFFICE>
   Running "NSDA -RT"
   "NSDA -RT" terminated normally with exit code 64

CAUSE
=====

The Single Postoffice Instance setting check box is only for the Mail External
program (EXTERNAL.EXE). The DISPATCH.EXE program does not recognize this option.

RESOLUTION
==========

A Dynadmin table has one of three options:

 - Add a DrivesUNC= statement with the serverpath being the home postoffice.

 - Set the SERVER.GLB file to zero bytes. This will remove the Dynadmin table
   for this postoffice.

   To set SERVER.GLB to zero bytes, use MS-DOS to rename the SERVER.GLB file in
   the \MAILDATA\GLB directory, such as SERVER.BAK. Then, type the following at
   the \MAILDATA\GLB directory prompt

   "Type nul>server.glb" (without the quotation marks)

 - Run DISPATCH.EXE from the MS-DOS command line. DISPATCH.EXE will not use
   Dynamic drives from the command line unless the DrivesDynamic= setting is
   used in the DISPATCH.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Single Postoffice Instance check box was designed only for use with the
Windows NT version of EXTERNAL.EXE.
