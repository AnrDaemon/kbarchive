The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The SNA Server APPC Programmer's Guide included with SNA Server 2.0, 2.1 and
2.11 incorrectly documents a sema parameter in the description of the
[MC_]RECEIVE_AND_POST function.

On Windows NT, the sema parameter is an auto-reset event object obtained by
calling either the CreateEvent or OpenEvent Win32 functions. Because the Win32
APPC interface uses an auto-reset event object, the application does not need to
manage the state of the event when calling [MC_]RECEIVE_AND_POST.

On OS/2, the sema parameter is either a RAM or system semaphore.

This correction is documented in the SNA Server 2.11 Enhancements Guide.
