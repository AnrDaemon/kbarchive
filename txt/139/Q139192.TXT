The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to print in Home Cooking with Master Chefs, the resulting page
only includes a Julia Child title at the top and a page number at the bottom.

This occurs if you click print, and then change the selected screen to a
non-printable screen before the print command has completed. In this case, the
text from the printable screen is not printed.


RESOLUTION
==========

Complete the print command before you change to a different section or screen in
Home Cooking with the Master Chefs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The final step in completing a print command is clicking OK. The OK dialog box
originates from the Windows operating system.

This dialog box shows the number of copies to print and the printer to print to.
When you click OK in this box, you complete the print command, and can move to a
different section of the program without affecting your print output.
