TITLE   :Interactive Switch Fails With Schedule Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Applications can be scheduled to run at a predetermined day and time using the
AT command. These applications can be run on the desktop by including
/INTERACTIVE in the command line. Jobs may be scheduled to run in the background
by omitting /INTERACTIVE in the command line. Omitting this switch has no effect
in Windows NT 3.51.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
