MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open the Testdata.dbc database found in the \Vfp\Samples\Data directory.

2. Create a new form.

3. Add the Customer table from the Testdata database to the Data Environment of
   the form.

4. Add a grid by dragging the Grid icon from the Form Controls toolbar onto the
   form.

5. Set the RecordSource property of the grid to the Customer table.

6. Add a command button to the form.

7. Add the following code to the Command1 Click event procedure:

         thisform.grid1.column2.text1.value='Hello World'
         thisform.grid1.refresh

8. Save the form as Test.scx, and run it.

9. Click the Command1 button. You will notice that the grid does not have the
   new value in the Company field.

Place the following code in the Command1 Click event to work around the problem
and place the correct value in Grid1:

      REPLACE (thisform.grid1.column2.text1.controlsource) WITH 'Hello World'
      thisform.grid1.refresh
