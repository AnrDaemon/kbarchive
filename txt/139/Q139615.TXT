SUMMARY
=======

If you start Windows NT and notice a blank screen, the video driver you are
using may be damaged. This article describes how you can verify that the video
driver is damaged.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To verify the video driver is damaged:

1. Boot Windows NT in /basevideo mode. If the video driver is not the standard
   VGA compatible driver (VGA.SYS), this operation should work.

2. If the video driver is VGA.SYS, do not boot Windows NT in /basevideo mode.
   Instead, start Windows NT "blind." For additional information, please see the
   following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q103615
   TITLE : Recovering From an Incompatible Video Driver

3. Shutdown Windows NT "blind" and reboot your computer. To verify that the
   Windows NT has restarted, attempt to connect to a network share on this
   computer from another computer.

After you verify that the video driver is damaged, do one of the following:

 - Boot your computer using the Windows NT Setup Boot Disk (for your version of
   Windows NT) and select R for Repair. Enable the "Verify Windows NT system
   files" option, and continue with the Repair process.

   -OR-

 - Copy VGA.SYS from the I386 directory (for Intel platforms) on the Windows NT
   Server or Workstation CD-ROM disc to the following directory:

   %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS
