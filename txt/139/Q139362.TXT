MORE INFORMATION
================

New features of Visual SourceSafe 4.0 include:

Integration
-----------

Visual SourceSafe can now be integrated into Visual Basic 4.0 (Enterprise and
Professional editions) and a Microsoft Developer Studio product. From inside
those environments, the user has access to all the common Visual SourceSafe
commands without leaving the IDE.

New Look and Feel
-----------------

Older versions of Visual SourceSafe were designed to look like the Microsoft
Windows 3.1 File Manager. Visual SourceSafe 4.0 is designed with the look and
feel of the Microsoft Windows 95 Explorer. Other visual enhancements include tab
dialog boxes for Options and Properties, friendlier menu names, and a redesigned
toolbar with tool tips.

Long Filenames
--------------

Visual SourceSafe 4.0 supports file and project names up to 255 characters, with
project paths up to 259 characters. Usernames, labels, and other strings have
also been expanded.

Working Directory
-----------------

Visual SourceSafe's handling of the Working Directory, the most common cause of
confusion in Visual SourceSafe 3.x, has been vastly improved in 4.0. If a user
has not designated a working directory for a project, no "default" working
directory is assigned. You must specify a working directory to use certain
commands, such as Get and Check Out. In addition, the working directory display
has been moved to a more prominent location above the file list in the Visual
SourceSafe Explorer.

International Support
---------------------

Visual SourceSafe 4.0 supports international date/time formats and will be
localized into languages used around the world.
