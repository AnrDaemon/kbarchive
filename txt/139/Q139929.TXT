TITLE   :SNMP Queries of Very Long OIDs May Cause SNMP Service to Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An SNMP 'get' or 'get next' request of an extremely long OID (object identifier)
causes the SNMP service to stop responding (hang) on the target computer. This
results in 100% CPU utilization, SNMP request time outs, and possible
application errors in SNMP.EXE.

WORKAROUND
==========

Avoid performing extremely long SNMP queries of non-existent OID's. If the SNMP
agent is hung, the SNMP service can be stopped and started from the Services
icon in Control Panel. This returns CPU utilization to normal.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
