The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 95 The Complete Interactive Multimedia Encyclopedia for Macintosh 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from one of the programs listed at the top of this article to a
color printer, the highlighted jump text (hot text) does not print. This occurs
with the Printer Setup color option turned on.

RESOLUTION
==========

To print an article with hot text, do one of the following:

 - Change the printer settings to use the Black Text or Black and White settings
   instead of the color settings.

   -or-

 - Change the Jump Text color to a darker color. This may allow the text to
   print.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When you print to a color printer with a black printer cartridge installed in
the printer but with the printer set for color, the colors needed to print are
not available. No error message is generated. The hot text simply does not
print. Changing the printer settings to correctly match the cartridge solves
this problem.

For information on how to change the hot text colors, see Help for your
multimedia program.
