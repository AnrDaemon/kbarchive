PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0 SP2,2.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200preSP3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply the RC9 version of Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service
Pack 3 (SP3), updates that are made to client agent settings are not propagated
to the client computers properly.

SMS 2.0 SP3 RC9 (1493.3009) was initially released to the Web for Premier
customers. Shortly after this release, a problem was discovered and Microsoft
re-released SP3. This article describes the availability of a hotfix to upgrade
an RC9 site to the full release version of SMS 2.0 SP3, which does not have this
problem.

This problem occurs only in the RC9 version of SMS 2.0 SP3.

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the following SMS 2.0 SP3 RC9 hotfix that upgrades your version to the
full release version of SMS 2.0 SP3.

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.
