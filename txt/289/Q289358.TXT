SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Dynamic HTML effects (DHTML) to different cells in a table and
then view the table in a Web browser, the DHTML effects may not occur as
expected.

For example, let's say you apply DHTML effects to the first two cells of a table
to change the border color of the cell to a different color when the mouse
pointer passes over the cell. When you view the page in a Web browser, you see
only the DHTML effects applied to the first cell.

NOTE: Some DHTML effects may not be supported by your Web browser. For more
information about compatibility with other browsers, click Microsoft FrontPage
Help on the Help menu, type "compatibility" (without the quotation marks) in the
Office Assistant or the Answer Wizard, and then click Search to view the topic.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and have the DHTML effects work when the mouse
pointer passes over the cells, add text to the cells that contain the DHTML
effects. The DHTML effects will occur when the mouse passes over the text of the
cells when viewing the table in your Web browser.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
