TITLE   :Redirect URL Corruption When Requested URL Contains Trailing "/"
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCOMIS kbWin2000sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the HTTP redirect option for virtual directories in Microsoft
Internet Information Server (IIS) 5.0, HTTP clients may randomly redirect to
non-existent files, which results in HTTP 404 errors on the client.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because IIS 5.0 stores an invalid string length for the
redirected virtual directory source path, which results in corrupted redirects
when the requested file is concatenated with the source string. The string
length is stored incorrectly because the initial HTTP client request (which is
used to set up the redirection cache blob for a redirected virtual directory)
contains an additional terminating forward slash ("/").

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not use a terminating forward slash in the
source for HTML elements that request a file from a redirected virtual directory
on the IIS 5.0 server. For example, replace the following redirect source path

   http://server/redirected_directory/

with this source path:

   http://server/redirected_directory

RESOLUTION
==========
