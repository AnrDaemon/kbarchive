TITLE   :HTMLA with SSL Incorrectly Warns of a Non-Secure Connection
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the HTML Administration Web Site through a Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) connection, the following error message occurs:

   Warning! You are not using a secure connection for your Web-based
   administration. For more information, see Secure Sockets Layer in the
   Internet Information Services online documentation.

CAUSE
=====

The Java script that parses the URL to find and identify an SSL connection is
passed the incorrect parameters.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the Default.asp page in the C:\WINNT\System32\Inetsrv\Iisadmin directory.
Find the following line of code:

   if (curURL.substring(0,4) != "HTTPS")

and change it to:

   if (curURL.substring(0,5) != "HTTPS")

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following statement will always return "HTTP," and therefore always
evaluates true in the IF statement and triggers the warning message:

   if (curURL.substring(0,4) != "HTTPS")
   {
   	alert("<%= L_NOSSL_TEXT %>");
   }

From the SDK:

substring( int beginIndex, int endIndex )

Returns a new string that is a substring of this string. The substring begins at
the specified beginIndex and extends to the character at index endIndex - 1.
