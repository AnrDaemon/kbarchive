TITLE   :Blank Spaces in Folder Name Aliases Become Underscore Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:w2000sfu kbUNIXService

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you mount a folder from a UNIX client to a server that is running the
Server for NFS service in Services for UNIX, spaces in folders or file names are
automatically converted to an underscore character (_).

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you start Microsoft Windows Explorer, and you try to map a network drive to
point to C:\Program Files, the default alias is "Program Files". This alias does
not pass the NFS aliasing requirements. Currently, the default alias that is
used is "Program_Files"; this alias satisfies the aliasing requirement.

When you create an NFS share on a computer that is running Windows 2000 with
Services for UNIX 2.0, an underscore character replaces all the blank spaces.
When you connect to the NFS share from an NFS client, type an underscore
character in place of the blank spaces when you access the share.
