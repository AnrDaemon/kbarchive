SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create a query in your Systems Management Server
(SMS) version 2.0 administrator console to return information about all
computers that do not have a particular file installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a query that returns information about all computers that do not have
a particular file installed, you must first create a query that can detect all
computers that have a selected file installed. In the following example, the
file is named Mynotepad.exe. To create a query that displays all computers that
contain the Mynotepad.exe file:

1. In the SMS Administrator console, right-click the Queries node. Click New,
   and then click Query.

2. Give the new query a name and click the "Edit Query Statement" button.

3. On the General tab, click the Star icon to add a new property.

4. In the Results Properties dialog box, click the Select button, and then
   specify System Resource for the attribute class and NetBIOS Name for the
   attribute. (There is no need to specify an alias except for your own
   readability.)

5. On the General tab, click to select the "Omit duplicate rows" check box so
   that duplicate entries in the results are not returned.

6. On the Criteria tab, click the Star icon to create a new criteria.

7. In the Criterion Properties dialog box, click the Select button. In Attribute
   Class, click either Software Files or Software Product. If the attribute
   class is Software Files, click File Name. Or, if the attribute class is
   Software Product, click Product Name. (This example only uses the Software
   Files and File Name settings for this query.)

8. The operator must remain at the "is equal to" default and the value must be
   the file name. The Values button can pull up all values, but it can be slow
   if there is an enormous number of values to be returned.

9. Click OK until the query is saved in the administrator console. Right-click
   the query and click Run Query to view the results. You now have a list of the
   computers that have the file specified. You are going to be using it to
   create the list of computers that do not have the specified file installed.

If you look at the query syntax in the SMS administrator console, it should
resemble the following example:

select distinct SMS_R_System.NetbiosName from SMS_R_System inner join
SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile on SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile.ResourceID =
SMS_R_System.ResourceId where SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile.FileName =
"mynotepad.exe"

To create the query that can display the computers that do not have a particular
file installed, begin the same procedure that you used to create a query to find
an installed file:

1. In the SMS administrator console, right-click the Queries node. Click New,
   and then click Query.

2. Give the new query a name and click the "Edit Query Statement" button.

3. On the General tab, click the Star icon to add a new property.

4. In the Results Properties dialog box, click the Select button, and then
   specify System Resource for the attribute class and Netbios Name for the
   attribute. (There is no need to specify an alias except for your own
   readability.)

5. On the General tab, click to select the "Omit duplicate rows" check box so
   that duplicate entries in the results are not returned.

6. On the Criteria tab, click the Star icon to create a new criteria.

7. In the Criterion Properties dialog box, specify Sub-selected values for the
   Criterion Type.

8. In the Criterion Properties dialog box, click the Select button. In Attribute
   Class, click either Software Files or Software Product. If the attribute
   class is Software Files, click File Name. Or, if the attribute class is
   Software Product, click Product Name. (This example only uses the Software
   Files and File Name settings for this query.) The operator must be changed to
   "is not in".

9. Click the Browse button at this point to select the previously created query
   that finds all computers that have a file installed. This imports the query
   syntax directly into the Sub-object window.

If you examine the query syntax for this second query in the SMS administrator
console, it may resemble the following example:

select distinct Name from SMS_R_System where Name not in (select distinct
SMS_R_System.Name from SMS_R_System inner join SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile on
SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile.ResourceID = SMS_R_System.ResourceID where
SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile.FileName = "mynotepad.exe") order by Name

When you run this query, it returns to the Results window information about all
computers that do not have this particular file installed.

NOTE: If your software inventory is not set up to detect the file type you are
searching for, it may not be returned. A search by product name is more accurate
than a search by file name.
