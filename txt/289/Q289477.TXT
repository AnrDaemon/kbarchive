TITLE   :Err Msg Installing DB2 ODBC Driver: Could Not Load Wappc32.dll
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install only the Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2 from the Host
Integration Server CD-ROM (and nothing else from this disc), and then go into
the Windows ODBC configuration and attempt to configure a TCP/IP connection
directly to the host, you may receive the following error message:

   Could not load Wappc32.dll

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs only when you edit the data source. However, it does not
hinder data source connectivity.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent this behavior from occurring, install the SNA Application Support
option in addition to the Data Integration options already installed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
