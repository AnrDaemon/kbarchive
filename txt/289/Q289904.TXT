The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Although a CD-ROM is not a media option in the Setup Wizard, you can create a
CD-ROM setup disk to install your Visual FoxPro application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard does not support creating CDs. However, you can
create a Netsetup file and place this on a CD. Note that creating a CD using the
Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard is not supported by Microsoft.

To create a CD to install your application, follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder and name it Mysource. Create your executable file and
   place it along with any other files, such as data files, in the Mysource
   folder.

2. Create a destination folder and name it CDROM (this is used in step 3 of the
   Setup Wizard).

3. Start the Setup Wizard. In step 1 of the wizard, point to the distribution
   files.

4. In step 2, choose your options as needed.

5. In step 3, for Disks images folder, select CDROM, and for Disk images, select
   Netsetup (uncompressed).

6. Continue through the remaining steps. In step 7, click Finish.

7. Use your CD-ROM creation software to write the contents of the Netsetup
   folder to the CD that you are making.

After you have performed these steps, the users can insert the CD on their
computers, browse to the Setup.exe file, and double-click the file to begin the
setup process.
