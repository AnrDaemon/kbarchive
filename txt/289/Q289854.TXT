TITLE   :XIMS: NDRs Not Generated Even Though Mail Fails to Get Forwarded
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Internet Mail Service, if you click the "Disable Automatic Replies to the
Internet" option under Advanced Options, you cannot automatically forward mail
to the Internet by using the inbox rules. However, you do not receive any
notification that the forwarding is not successful when you attempt to do so.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you enable message tracking, you can see that the inbox rule still starts,
and attempts to pass the forwarded message to the Internet Mail Service, because
the message "Message transferred to the Internet Mail Service
(<servername>)" is displayed. However, the Internet Mail Service then
drops the message without generating a Non-Delivery Report (NDR).
