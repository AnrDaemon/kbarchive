SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create an advanced group mapping, you may receive the following
error message:

   You have specified a special Windows Account.
   Are you sure you want to set an advanced mapping for this account?

CAUSE

This problem can occur because the Mapping server always compares the group to
the UNIX group numbers. The error message that is listed in the "Symptoms"
section of this article is generated if the Windows group has the same name as a
special UNIX group.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

The error message that is listed in the "Symptoms" section of this article has
