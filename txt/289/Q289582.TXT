   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade from previous versions of Internet Information Server (IIS) to
the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack (IIS 4.0) and enable Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL), browsers may fail to connect through HTTPS. The browser may return
one of the following error messages:

   Page Cannot Be Displayed

   -or-

   Page Cannot Be Found

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Filter Dlls registry entry is left with an invalid
path to the Sspifilt.dll file after you upgrade.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this problem, make sure that Sspifilt.dll is not loaded in the legacy
W3SVC registry entry as follows:

1. On the Start menu, click Run, and then type "regedt32" (without the quotation
   marks).

2. In Registry Editor, locate the
   HKEY_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\Parameters\Filter
   Dlls registry key.

3. Double-click Filter Dlls to display the string value.

4. Delete the path entry for Sspifilt.dll (which is
   <Drive>\WINNT\System32\Inetsrv\Sspifilt.dll by default.)

5. Click OK to close the String Editor.

6. Restart the server for the changes to take effect.
