TITLE   :SMS: SQL Replication of the SMS Database Is Not Supported
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbsms200

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS), on a computer that is running
Microsoft SQL Server, you can perform the replication of user databases by using
the SQL Replication feature. However, the implementation of SQL Replication that
is using the SMS Database is not supported by Microsoft Product Support
Services.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some types of SQL Replication alter the SMS Database to such a degree that
normal operations cause errors. For example, some forms of SQL Replication
insert a time stamp column in each table that is to be replicated. The new
column includes the constraint that the column may not contain a NULL value.
Because SMS does not include this column in its update procedures when it
inserts rows into tables, SMS attempts to insert a NULL value in this column,
which produces an error and which stops the rows from being inserted.

You can view these errors in the SMS component logs when Discovery records,
Status Messages, Inventory records and other updates to the database occur.
Consequently, further updates to these components are not successful.

In addition, you may be unable to apply SMS service packs because of the database
modifications.

To recover from this problem, disable replication of the SMS Database, and
restore the database from a backup copy that does not contain the additional
column. You may want to reinstall the site in some instances.
