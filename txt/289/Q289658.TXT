TITLE   :FeedIgnoreInitial Not Always Honored on HIS 2000 Print Sessions
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbhis2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Print jobs printed through the host print service on Host Integration Server
(HIS) 2000 may print an extra, blank page at the beginning of the print job. The
blank page is printed when the print job includes a form feed (0x0C) at the
beginning of the print job even though the FEEDIGNOREINITIAL option is set to
Yes for the HIS 2000 print session.

CAUSE
=====

The FeedIgnoreInitial option is not honored by the print service that is
included with HIS 2000 for one of the following reasons:

 - If the print session is configured to use a printer definition table (PDT),
   the print session sends a Hewlett Packard Printer Control Language (PCL)
   sequence to the printer. This PCL sequence is treated as real print data
   being sent to the printer, which causes the FeedIgnoreInitial option to be
   ignored by the host print service.

-or-

 - The HIS 2000 print service honors all EBCDIC characters under "0x40" by
   default. This causes the FeedIgnoreInitial option to be ignored unless the No
   Space After FF option is selected in the Print Service Properties dialog box
   in SNA Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+-----------------------------------+
| File name   | Date       | Time   | 
+-----------------------------------+
| Ppd3270.dll | 02/15/2001 | 9:43AM | 
+-----------------------------------+
| Winvprt.dll | 02/15/2001 | 9:43AM | 
+-----------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

If the print session is not using a PDT and an extra blank page is being printed
at the beginning of the job with FeedIgnoreInitial=Yes, one of the following
configuration changes should correct the problem:

 - Select the No Space After FF option in the Print Service Properies dialog box
   in SNA Manager.

-or-

 - Select the Ignore Characters 3F and Under option in the Print Service
   Properies dialog box in SNA Manager.

The configuration of either of these options may affect the output of the print
job, so you should examine the output to make sure the desired affect is
achieved. The effect of these options can vary depending on the content of the
actual print data sent by the host application.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.
