SUMMARY
=======

The Mailbox Manager System Cleanup folder may be reported as absent on client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Typically, the System Cleanup folder is created on the client when Mailbox
Manager is configured to use the System Cleanup folder to temporarily hold
deleted items until you permanently remove the deleted items. If no items are in
the System Cleanup folder the next time the System Cleanup process runs, the
System Cleanup folder is removed from the client.

This behavior is by design.

Additional query words: xadm
