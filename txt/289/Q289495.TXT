TITLE   :XADM: Pfadmin Version 1.30 Error Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Pfadmin program from the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit, you
may receive one of the following error messages:

 - Error message if users are not found:

   -SETACL TopLevelFolder\SubfolderA\SubfolderB\SubfolderC Default Reviewer
   Anonymous None Smith, Bill Author All No
   >Error, user(s) not found: "Smith, Bill"

 - Error message if folders are not found:

   -SETACL TopLevelFolder\SubfolderA\SubfolderB\SubfolderC Default Reviewer
   Anonymous Reviewer All No
   >Could not find folder "TopLevelFolder\SubfolderA\SubfolderB"

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if Pfadmin does not process the Access Control List (ACL)
for a folder when one of the error conditions in the "Symptoms" section of this
article is met. The Pfadmin tool is a Resource Kit utility and, at the time of
this article's publication, cannot be modified.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods:

 - If the error message occurs because users are not found, usually some objects
   are no longer in the Exchange Server directory. To work around this issue,
   open the Pfadmdat.txt file (the file from which Pfinfo.exe imports ALCs) in
   Microsoft Notepad or Microsoft Word, and then parse through the file manually
   to remove the objects (mailboxes, Distribution lists, and so on) that are
   listed immediately following the "Error, user(s) not found:" line.

 - If the error message occurs because folders are not found, usually the
   specified folders do not have an instance on the local server or site on
   which Pfadmin is run. To work around this issue, make sure that a replica or
   instance of the specified folders exists on the local public folder Exchange
   Server computer.
