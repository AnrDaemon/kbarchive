TITLE   :WINS Settings Are Missing on VPN Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you establish a virtual private network (VPN) connection to a Windows NT
4.0-based server that is running the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS),
the client's primary or secondary WINS server settings may be missing.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you have more than 105 VPN ports defined in RRAS, and
you set the ports to "Dial out and receive calls", instead of setting them to
"Receive calls only".

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use RRAS to set the VPN ports to "Receive Calls Only".

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if the client's primary or secondary WINS server settings are
missing, run the ipconfig /all command on the client.

In general, servers do not need 105 outgoing VPN connections. A server that is
running Windows NT can handle several hundred incoming VPN connections without
trouble (depending on memory and other resources). The issue described in this
article results from the number of outgoing ports.

RRAS includes the following options:

 - "Dial out as a RAS client"

 - "Receive calls as a RAS server"

 - "Dial out and receive calls as a demand dial router"

This issue occurs if you select "Dial out as a RAS client", and there are more
than 105 ports.
