TITLE   :XFOR: Notes Application Connector Not Replicating Responses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you use the Notes Application Conversion Assistant to convert Lotus Notes
database information to Exchange Server public folder information, the Notes
Application Connection utility replicates content between Notes and Exchange
Server. Replies from Exchange Server users may not be replicated correctly to
the Notes database. When Notes users view the replies the Notes users may
receive a message that states, "No default form found."

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because the Application Connector needs to determine
which form to use when it imports the data to Notes. The Application Connector
uses the default form for the public folder that the Application Connector is
replicating.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, open the public folder, and then select the form that
the Application Conversion Assistant created as the default form for the public
folder. Run the Application Connection utility again to make the data viewable
by the Notes users.
