TITLE   :FIX: SQLGetData Returns Extra Character For StrLen_or_IndPtr
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER::Build 2.73.7269,Build 2.73.7283.01,Build 2.73.7283.03,Build 2.73.7356

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.0, versions Build 2.73.7269, Build 2.73.7283.01, Build 2.73.7283.03, Build 2.73.7356 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using SQLGetData, the StrLen_or_IndPtr is the length of TargetValuePtr + 1. The
length is including the NULL terminator for the string.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Microsoft's Oracle
ODBC Driver 2.573.2927 and higher. This driver is available in MDAC 2.0, part
Visual Studio 6.0, and the latest MDAC version can be downloaded from the
following Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/data

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Use ODBC Test to perform the following steps:

1. Connect to a data source using the driver.

2. Call SQLGetTypeInfo (to create a result set).

3. Call SQLExtendedFetch:

   In:StatementHandle = 0x00301250,

   FetchOrientation = SQL_FETCH_NEXT=1,

   FetchOffset = 1,

   RowCountPtr = 0x0014B348,

   RowStatusArray = 0x0014B378

   Return:   SQL_SUCCESS=0

   Out:  *RowCountPtr = 1,

   *RowStatusArray = 0

4. Call SQLGetData:

   In: Statementhandle = 0x00301250,

   ColumnNumber = 1,

   TargetType = SQL_C_CHAR=1,

   TargetValuePtr = 0x0014BF10,

   BufferLength = 256,

   StrLen_or_IndPtr = 0x0014AD58

   Return:   SQL_SUCCESS=0

   Out: *TargetValuePtr = "LONG RAW",

   *StrLen_or_IndPtr = 9

NOTE: StrLen_or_IndPtr equals nine, yet there are only eight characters in the
TargetValuePtr.

Expected behavior:

   Out: *TargetValuePtr = "LONG RAW", *StrLen_or_IndPtr = 8

The ODBC Test utility can be obtained from the Microsoft Data Access SDK, which
comes with Visual Studio or can be downloaded from the following Web site:
