TITLE   :FIX: C1001 Compiling File Containing Local Enum with Debug Info
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC600bug kbVS600sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When building a source file that contains a function with a local enumeration,
and the compiler options are set to generate debug information, the compiler
fails with the following error:

   <filename>(line#) : fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
   (compiler file 'msc1.cpp', line 1786)
   Please choose the Technical Support command on the Visual C++
   Help menu, or open the Technical Support help file for more information

This bug typically occurs only during a full build and not when compiling an
individual file.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following is a suggested workaround:

 - Turn off use of precompiled headers. This solution can result in excessive
   build times, especially for large projects.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.
