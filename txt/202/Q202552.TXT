TITLE   :SMS: Time Synchronizing an SMS Site Server with SQL Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the system time on the Systems Management Server (SMS) Site Server and the
Microsoft SQL Server become different, SMS may begin to experience operational
problems such as difficulties distributing software.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because SMS does not provide any checks that confirm that
accuracy of the time on the SMS site server in relation to a time server or a
SQL server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit includes a tool
that can install a "time service" to synchronize the time on the server, even if
no one is logged in, or ever logs in. Please view the Windows NT Resource Kit
documentation for installation and configuration instructions for the
Timeserv.exe tool. Administrators could use the Timeserv.exe tool to synchronize
the servers automatically. For additional information about how to set up a
Windows NT Server as a Time server, click the article number below to view the
