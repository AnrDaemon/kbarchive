SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server 2.0 has the capability of restricting what is written
to the database through IDMIFs and NOIDMIFs; for example, to prevent large MIF's
from processing and quickly filling the database.

The following changes have been made to the hardware inventory agent in Systems
Management Server 2.0 to provide greater control on what is written to the
database:

1. Each NOIDMIF is checked and rejected if it exceeds the "Maximum 3rd Party MIF
   Size". This defaults to 100 KB, and the absolute maximum is 5 MB.

2. Each IDMIF is checked prior to parsing, and will be rejected if:

   a. The size exceeds the "Maximum 3rd Party MIF Size". This defaults to 100
      KB, and the absolute maximum is 5 MB.

   b. The IDMIF targets the System Architecture; that is, for example:

   //Architecture <System>
   //Architecture <Personal Computer>

3. After these preliminary checks, the IDMIF is parsed and will be rejected if a
   reference is made to an 'Architecture' MIF Group, which contains an
   'ArchitectureName' Attribute with a value of 'Personal Computer'; that is,
   for example:

   Start Group
   Name = 'Architecture'
   ...
   Start Attribute
   Name = 'ArchitectureName'
   Value = 'Personal Computer'
   ...
   End Attribute
   End Group
   <BR/><BR/>
   Start Group
   Name = 'Architecture'
   ...
   Start Attribute
   Name = 'ArchitectureName'
   Value = 'System'
   ...
   End Attribute
   End Group

   The following examples of IDMIF architecture Groups are valid and will be
   processed:

   Start Group
   Name = 'Architecture'
   ...
   Start Attribute
   Name = 'ArchitectureName'
   Value = 'Fishing Tackle'
   ...
   End Attribute
   End Group

   or

   Start Group
   Name = 'SMSTeam'
   ...
   Start Attribute
   Name = 'ArchitectureName'
   Value = 'Personal Computer'
   ...
   End Attribute
   End Group

NOTE: Rejected MIFs will be moved into a BADMIFs subdirectory on the client.
