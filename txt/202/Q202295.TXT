TITLE   :XIMS: IMS Configuration May Unexpectedly Overwrite Proxy Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user sends Internet mail to an Exchange Server proxy address, the user
may receive a non-delivery report (NDR). This can occur when the Internet Mail
Service (IMS) has been reconfigured while there is a proxy address in use.

CAUSE
=====

When the Exchange Server 5.5 IMS is configured, there is a high possibility of
overwriting existing SMTP proxy addresses that do not match the site addressing
for SMTP.

The proxy generator module is not being called correctly from within the IMS
Wizard. Therfore, it is necessary to modify the updated addresses to reflect how
they should read. In some cases, this may only require importing a Commas
Separated Format (CSV) file.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you configure the IMS in this scenario, do not modify the site address
using the IMS Wizard. If it is necessary to modify the site address, do so
through the Configuration container: Site Addressing object: Site Addressing
property page.
