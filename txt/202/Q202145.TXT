======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a source code control tool such as Visual SourceSafe on a Visual
Basic project, .frm files appear to lose font information for controls.

CAUSE
=====

If a control's font matches the font of the parent form exactly, the font blocks
are optimized out of the property definitions. When Visual Basic loads a control
that does not contain a font block, the font property of the control is set to
the font that is used by the control's parent form.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can safely ignore a difference report that shows a missing font.

To avoid the problem, do one of the following:

 - Set the Font property of the Form to a font or font size that is not used by
   the controls on the form.
 - Set the Font property of each control at run time.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to reproduce behavior
---------------------------

1. In Visual Basic, create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

3. Change the font of the CommandButton in the Properties window.

4. Save the project and add the project to Visual SourceSafe.

5. Check out Form1.

6. Change the Font property of CommandButton1 to be the same as Form1.

7. Save Form1 and close Visual Basic.

8. Start Visual Basic and reload your project.

9. Add a line of code to the project and delete it. This causes Visual Basic to
   mark the form as "dirty," which prompts cleanup when it is saved.

10. Save Form1.frm.

11. From the Tools menu, point to SourceSafe and click Show Differences to open
   the Difference Options dialog box. Click OK to display the difference
   report.

RESULT: The difference report shows that the reference to the Font property of
Command1 was deleted.
