PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbQuery

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server 2.0, the query operator is not able to find items
whose value is NULL.

WORKAROUND
==========

When typing values in Systems Management Server 2.0 to query on, some value must
be specified. If your intent is to find all computers that have a NULL value for
a particular instance, an error will be generated when trying to set up the
query. To get the query to operate properly, type a space character in the
field. This will act that same as a NULL entry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
