SUMMARY
=======

In Systems Management Server 2.0, the default directory for the File Transfer
window has changed. The startup directory for the Administrator console is
different from the startup directory for the client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The File Transfer agent is not intuitive and uses specific directories that it
knows exist when starting up. In Systems Management Server 1.2, the client's
default directory for the File Transfer window is \%SystemRoot%. With Systems
Management Server 2.0, the client default directory for the File Transfer window
is \%System Root%\MS\SMS\CLICOMP\Remctrl and the Administrator console default
directory for the File Transfer window is \SMS\BIN\I386.

Additional query words: dir startup folder
