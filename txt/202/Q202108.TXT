======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0, Software Audit will
not collect or display the full file path names for both known and unknown
product files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The full file path is not reported due to scalability concerns. If the full path
of each file on a client were to be displayed, it would greatly increase the
size of each Software Inventory (SINV) file as well as the database. It would
also force Systems Management Server to begin to report duplicate files as they
are discovered. Currently, when a duplicate file is found, the file count is
incremented in the database generally resulting in no, or minimal database
growth.
