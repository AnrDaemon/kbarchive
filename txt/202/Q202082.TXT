PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Software Inventory reporting detail can be
configured to report just the application, but not the files associated with the
application. This is configurable in the Software Inventory Agent configuration
screen under the Inventory Collection tab in the SMS Administrator console.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The options are listed under "Reporting Detail." From there, you can specify the
level of inventory file information that you want reported. For SMS to report
information on inventoried files, you must select at least one check box:

Product version information:
----------------------------

Information about "known" products (products that have company name, product
name, version, and language) is inventoried and displayed per manufacturer in
Resource Explorer. By default, this check box is selected.

Files associated with known products:
-------------------------------------

Resource Explorer lists files associated with the inventoried products. For
example, Resource Explorer would associate Wwintl32.dll with Microsoft Word.
This check box is available only when Product version information is selected.
By default, this check box is cleared.

Files not associated with known products:
-----------------------------------------

Files that do not include company and product information are inventoried and
displayed in the Resource Explorer Unknown list. By default, this check box is
selected.
