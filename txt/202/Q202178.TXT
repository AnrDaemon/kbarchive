TITLE   :XFOR: Messages to cc:Mail Queued in Submit Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Messages from Microsoft Exchange Server to Lotus cc:Mail are sitting in the
queue in the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Submit folder. No errors are reported in the
application log and the Microsoft Exchange cc:Mail Connector service starts
without error. However, the messages are not delivered to cc:Mail.

CAUSE
=====

When the Microsoft Exchange cc:Mail connector is converting the messages to the
cc:Mail format, the messages are written to the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Submit folder.
After the conversion is finished, the Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail
should then write the files to the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Import folder. If the
Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Import folder is corrupted, the files cannot be written to the
folder, and they remain queued in Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Submit.

RESOLUTION
==========

To solve this problem:

1. Stop the Microsoft Exchange cc:Mail connector service.

2. In the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata folder, move all files and subfolders to a temporary
   Submit folder. Leave Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata empty.

3. Restart the Microsoft Exchange cc:Mail connector service. All the subfolders
   and .ini files are recreated in the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata folder.

4. Stop the Microsoft Exchange cc:Mail connector service.

5. Move all files from the temporary Submit folder to the
   Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Submit folder.

6. Restart the Microsoft Exchange cc:Mail connector service. All files in the
   Submit folder should be successfully processed and sent to cc:Mail.
