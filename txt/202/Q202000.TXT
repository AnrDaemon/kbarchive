======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server version 2.0, there currently is no method for
retrieving inventory data from NetWare servers. Discovery of NetWare servers is
also limited.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

The third-party products discussed in this article are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Systems Management Server 2.0 is not able to discover NetWare servers running
only NetWare Directory Services (NDS). If the server is a Bindery server or is
running in Bindery emulation mode, Systems Management Server will be able to
retrieve discovery data such as logon points, client access points (CAPs), and
distribution points.
