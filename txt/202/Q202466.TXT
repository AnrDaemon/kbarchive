 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

DNS Admin reports the wrong system reset time in the Statistics Last Cleared
field

CAUSE
=====

The DNS service incorrectly compensates for GMT when the system time is already
set to local time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The system time is incorrectly compensated for the GMT offset, which results in
the Statistics Last Cleared field displaying the incorrect time for the DNS
service being started. The amount of the time error is equal to your local
offset from GMT. If your time zone is GMT, no error will observed.
