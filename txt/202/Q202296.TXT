TITLE   :SMS: Cannot Modify Time of Day in Software Metering Graph Wizard
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsmsMeter

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Graph Wizard tool on the Tools menu of the Software
Metering console, if you select Days as the time period for each unit, you are
unable to modify the time of day in the "When would you like to graph from?"
option. Pressing the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys does not change the time of
day from its default setting of 12:00:00 A.M.

CAUSE
=====

When the interval is set to days, the time of day cannot be adjusted. When the
time period for each unit is set to minutes, the time of day adjustment works as
expected.
