TITLE   :CHAT: Cannot Change Default Location for Channel Transcription
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to change the default location for local transcription files
through the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Chat snap-in, the location will
not change until the system is restarted.

CAUSE
=====

The default location transcription is assessed one time, when the system is
started. Consequently, the change will not take effect until the server is
restarted.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by product design.
