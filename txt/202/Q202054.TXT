SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using Outlook 97 or Outlook 98 and you select the Option toolbar
button when you compose a message, and then designate another user as the
recipient for any replies, that recipient will be ignored, and the replies will
be sent back to you if the person responding to the message is using the Outlook
Web Access client. This does not occur if the person responding is using an
Outlook client.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following two Microsoft Knowledge Base articles on CDO 1.2 give instructions
for ways to modify the Active Server Pages in order to allow the "Reply to"
optional recipient information to be correctly routed in Outlook Web Access.
