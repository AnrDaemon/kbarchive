SYMPTOMS

binary format may not be able to be opened on an Outlook Web Access client.

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. From a Macintosh Exchange client, attach a Macintosh binary text file.

2. Send the message to another user who is using OWA.

3. When this user attempts to open the attached file, he or she will notice the
   attachment has lost the original icon that associates it with the source
   application, and the OWA client will not be able to open the file, even if it
   is saved.
