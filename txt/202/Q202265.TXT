TITLE   :XADM: Unable to Create Top Level Folders in Exchange Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to create a top level public folder in either the Exchange or
Outlook client, you may receive the following error message:

   Unable to create the folder. You do not have sufficient permission to perform
   this operation on this object. See the folder contact or your system
   administrator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs when an Exchange Server administrator limits who can create
top level folders. This administrative feature of Exchange Server allows
Exchange Server administrators to control the basic structure of how information
in the public folders is organized. To use this feature:

1. Log onto the Exchange Server Administrator program.

2. In the Administrator window, click Configuration.

3. Double-click the "Information Store Site Configuration" object in the right
   pane to open the properties.

4. Click the "Top Level Folder Creation "tab.

5. Check whether there are either Distribution Lists or Mailboxes listed in
   either the "Allow to create top level folders" area or the "Not allowed to
   create top level folders section" area.

6. Make sure the user or users wanting to create top level public folders are
   not listed.

NOTE: When both the "Allow to create top level folders" and the "Not allowed to
create top level folders section" are empty, everyone in the global address list
can create top-level folders.

Use the Top Level Folder Creation property page to specify which users can create
top-level public folders in Microsoft Outlook. Top-level public folders are
those that exist at the highest tier of the public folder tree. Limiting the
number of people who can create top-level public folders lets you control the
public folder hierarchy. After a top-level folder is created, the owner of that
folder can set permissions that allow other users to create subordinate folders
below the top-level folder.
