Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 provides Query functionality from the
Microsoft Management Console (MMC) SMS Administrator. The WBEM Query language
supports the following value operators:

 - IN ([value1], [value2], [value . . .])

 - IN (subselect)

 - BETWEEN ([value1] AND [value2])
   For example, t1.SiteCode BETWEEN 'aaa' AND 'ccc'

 - NOT IN ([value1], [value2], [value . . .])

 - NOT IN (subselect)

 - UPPER ([expr])

 - LOWER ([expr])

 - NULL ([expr] is NULL)

 - NOT NULL ([expr] is not NULL)

 - DATEPART ([part], [date 1]) (part =
   "mm","dd","yy","hour","minute","second","ms") = (equal) < > or != (not
   equal) < (greater than) > (less than)
