TITLE   :XFOR: Accept/Decline Message ID Mismatch on a Meeting Invitatio
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When a meeting invitation is sent from a user on one Exchange server to a user
on another server, the message ID may be mismatched from the original invitation
message ID. Consequently, the Accept/Decline message received from the invitee
does not update the invitee response list.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the times of the two Exchange Servers are not synchronized, then the message
ID of the Accept/Decline message (produced by the invitee when accepting or
declining the meeting invitation) is mismatched from the original invitation
message ID.

This problem occurs if the Accept/Decline message is sent within the time
difference between the two servers. That is, if the time difference between the
two Exchange servers is five minutes, an Accept/Decline message sent within five
minutes of receiving the invitation message can result in the behavior reported
above. In conclusion, the server times need to be synchronized as close as
possible.
