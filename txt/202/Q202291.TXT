KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0

SYMPTOMS

Remote Control Agent has been set up to do detailed logging to file. Turning on
detailed-level logging for the Remote Control Agent uses significant CPU
cycles.

logging for the Remote Control Agent does not impact system performance.

WORKAROUND
==========

Turn on logging to the Remote Control Agent only for troubleshooting purposes.

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
