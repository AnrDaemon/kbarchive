PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0, some newer IBM PS/2 systems may
not have their PCBIOS data updated in the PCBIOS\Category table of the database.
As a result, in addition to the PCBIOS information of newer systems not be
discovered and entered into the database, the PC systems are not identified.

CAUSE
=====

IBM does use the System Descriptor Table generated by INT 0x15 to identify the
different models. Getcomp.exe uses this same table to report the PCBIOS
property.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
