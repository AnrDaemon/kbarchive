TITLE   :Outlook 98 Does Not Read Certificates from Certificate Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Outlook 98 does not read certificates created by Microsoft Certificate Server.
Outlook 98 is sensitive to the contents of the KeyUsages field. Specifically, if
either KeyEncipherment or DigitalSignature is used, then both must be set.

CAUSE
=====

The default policy module shipped with the Windows NT Option Pack only sets
KeyEnchipherment and not DigitalSignature. Therefore, Outlook 98 does not read
certificates created by Certificate Server running the default policy module.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

You can also work around this issue by modifying the default policy module to
set both KeyEncipherment and DigitalSignature or neither when you are issuing
mail certificates.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0
and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The source code for the default policy module is available as part of the
Windows Base Services component of the Platform SDK from MSDN.
