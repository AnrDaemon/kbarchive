TITLE   :XADM: Using Mailbox Template w/Distribution Lists Between Sites
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in an Exchange
Server version 5.5 site to duplicate a mailbox template with Exchange Server
version 5.0 site distribution lists, or vice-versa, you get the following error
message:

   The object 'name' with the directory name 'alias' already exists. Enter a
   unique alias name on the general property page for this mail recipient.

CAUSE
=====

If you have a version 5.5 site with a mailbox template that contains a
distribution list from a version 5.0 site, when you click Duplicate on the File
menu of the Administrator program on this template to create a new mailbox, the
mailbox is created, but it is invalid. The new mailbox does not allow the user
to use it in some cases. These same results occur with a version 5.0 template
and version 5.5 distribution lists from another site, and you receive the same
error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

 - Don't use distribution lists in your mailbox templates from other sites of a
   different version.

-or-

 - Upgrade all sites to the same version.
