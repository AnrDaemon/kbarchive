TITLE   :SMS: Forced Disconnect Not Available on NW Distribution Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbDespooler kbOSNovell

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a client has a file open when a distribution process tries to copy files to
the target distribution servers, the distribution may fail or go into an endless
retry cycle.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

With Systems Management Server 1.2, a registry option was introduced to force a
disconnection of the client so the distribution phase could complete. The
registry entry is located at:

   
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_Despooler

The "Use Forced Disconnect" parameter should have a value of 1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This setting is still available in Systems Management Server 2.0. However, this
setting only applies to Windows NT distribution servers, and not to Novell
NetWare distribution servers.

For additional information about how to force disconnect Windows NT distribution
servers, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
