SUMMARY
=======

Status messages and log files refer to objects such as Collections, Packages,
and Advertisements their IDs (for example, SMS00024). The Administrator Console
only displays the names for these objects. This article describes the methods
you can use to trace the object ID to the object name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All of the object IDs are exposed in the Windows Management Instrumentation
(WMI) class, so you can query on them directly or create queries to generate a
cross-reference listing.

To create these types of queries, create a new query and give it an appropriate
name and comments:

1. Click <unspecified> for the object type.

2. Click Edit Query Statement.

3. Type the query statement.

    - To query on a specific ID, type the following command:

   select * from <class name> where <class property>="<object ID>"

      For example:

   select * from sms_collection where collectionID = "sms00024"

    - To query for a cross-reference listing, type the following command:

   select <class property>, Name from <Class>

      For example:

   select PackageID, Name from SMS_Package

It is also possible to find object IDs within the Administrator Console when you
start the console using the following command line:

   mmc.exe /sms:NodeInfo=1 <installationpath>\sms.msc

This adds an extra property page (tab) to every property sheet called Node
Information. The Node Information property page displays the underlying WMI
(WBEM) class with all its properties and instance information, which is useful
for debugging. The object ID is found in the Store Name section on this page.
