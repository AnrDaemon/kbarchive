The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server 2.0 can perform software inventory based on file type
using a wildcard character. The default is to search for .exe files (*.exe), but
you can modify this to search for any file type.

Note that unlike in Systems Management Server 1.2, you cannot look for a specific
file, such as Notepad.exe, you can only search for the file extension type.

When you examine the data in Resource Explorer for a specific client, the files
are listed under either the Manufacturer or Unknown Files tree in Microsoft
Management Console (MMC).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Systems Management Server determines whether to place the file under
Manufacturer or Unknown Files by reading the file's header information to find
manufacturer details. If the header does not contain the manufacturer
information, it is placed in the Unknown Files MMC tree.

Note that there are a number of file types that will not include this
manufacturer information, including .txt, .bat, .dat, and so forth.
