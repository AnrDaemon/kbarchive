SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) version 5.0 adds a new
command-line utility, Iisreset.exe, which can be used to restart IIS or schedule
restarting your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Iisreset.exe is designed to easily allow Web administrators to take a server
offline or recycle services through the command line, the Task Scheduler, or
batch commands that perform additional tasks.

In the example shown below, an administrator could write a batch file that stops
the Web services to flush the IIS logs, and then copy the logs to another server
or perform other housekeeping tasks, and then restart the services.

The syntax for using Iisreset.exe is as follows:

   IISRESET [computer name] [/option] [/option] [(and so on)]

The default behavior if no options are specified is to stop and restart the Web
services on the local computer.

Iisreset.exe supports the following command-line parameters:

   /RESTART
   This option stops, and then restarts all running Internet services.

   /START
   This will start all Internet services that are set to autostart.

   /STOP
   This will stop all running Internet services.

   /REBOOT
   This parameter will restart the computer.

   /REBOOTONERROR
   This restarts the computer only when an error occurs when trying to start,
   stop, or restart the Internet services.

   /NOFORCE
   Do not shut down Internet services on failure to stop them gracefully.

   /TIMEOUT:val
   This allows you to specify the timeout value in seconds waiting for a
   successful stop of Internet services. On expiration of this timeout, the
   computer can be restarted if the /REBOOTONERROR parameter is specified. The
   default value is 20 seconds for restart, 60 seconds for stop.

   /STATUS
   This displays the status of all Internet services.

   /ENABLE
   This enables the Restart API for Internet services.

   /DISABLE
   This will disable the Restart API for Internet services.

Examples:

The following command will attempt to restart all running Web services and reboot
the computer if the command is not successful for any reason:

   IISRESET /RESTART /REBOOTONERROR

This following will attempt to restart all running Web services, yet if either
the stop or restart commands are not successful within two minutes, the computer
will restart:

   IISRESET /RESTART /TIMEOUT:120 /REBOOTONERROR

The purpose of the following commands, when saved to a batch file, is to stop all
running Web services, copy the log files for the default Web server to a backup
directory on the D: drive, and then start all Web services. However, if the stop
command fails for some reason, it will not shut down the services, but simply
exit the batch file:

   @echo off
   IISRESET /STOP /NOFORCE
   if errorlevel == 1 goto EXIT
   copy %systemroot%\system32\LogFiles\W3SVC1 d:\backup\W3SVC1
   IISRESET /START
   :EXIT

Any of the preceding examples can be scheduled to run during non-peak hours for
your server using Task Scheduler. For more information on how to accomplish
this, search for Task Scheduler in Windows Help.
