-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print jobs from an MS-DOS-based program within Windows NT, Windows NT
does not pass the printer control codes to the printer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can obtain certain third-party programs that
allow print jobs to be sent directly to the printer without any processing by
Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setting the printer processor to RAW (click Start, point to Settings, click
Printers, right-click the non-network printer, click Properties, and then click
the General tab) or a using a custom separator page does not solve the issue.
