TITLE   :XFOR: Messages Queued at Lotus cc:Mail Post Office, Event ID 54
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Messages from Lotus cc:Mail to Exchange Server may remain queued at the cc:Mail
post office. The following event ID may be generated at the Exchange Server
computer:

   Event ID: 54
   Source: MSExchangeCCMC
   Type: Error
   Category: General
   Conversion of message failed and the message was moved to the Bad directory.

CAUSE
=====

The cc:Mail Export.exe program is not finishing exporting a message with a PC
Paintbrush (PCX) attachment.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. On the Exchange Server computer, check the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Bad folder. Open
   several of the files located there with Notepad and confirm that they are all
   from the same user (or are copies of the same message).

2. Locate the message in the cc:Mail post office queue that corresponds to the
   files from the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Bad folder.

3. After you locate the problem message in the queue, forward it to another
   cc:Mail mailbox, and delete it from the cc:Mail post office queue.

4. Restart the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail. The queued
   messages should now be sent from cc:Mail to Exchange Server.
