SYMPTOMS
========

Event Viewer logs the following entry in the system log:

   Event Id 5701
   Source: NETLOGON
   Description: The network service failed to update the domain trust list.

When you open User Manager or Server Manager, the following error is displayed:

   Could not find domain controller for this domain. Do you want to select
   another domain to administer?

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by a defective network card or driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reinstall the networking components. If that does not help, install another
network card.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following some basic connectivity troubleshooting may reveal a problem with the
network card or driver.

If TCP/IP is installed on the computer, run ipconfig/all from a command prompt to
check the IP configuration. If the IP address is 0.0.0.0, that would give
further indication to a problem with the network card.

Try other connectivity related troubleshooting, such as ping and net commands, to
further check for a problem with the network card or driver.
