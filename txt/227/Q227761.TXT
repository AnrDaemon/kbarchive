TITLE   :Unable to Install Service Pack 4 from Distributed File System
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Setup restarts your computer during an installation of Windows NT Service
Pack 4 (SP4) from a Distributed file system (DFS) share, you may receive one or
more of the following error messages:

    - Cannot find the file 'regsvr32.exe' (or one of its components). Make sure the
   path and filename are correct and that all required libraries are available.

    - Cannot find the file 'pstores..exe' (or one of its components). Make sure the
   path and filename are correct and that all required libraries are available

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur beause after the first logon after installing SP4,
Windows NT tries to run information stored in the registry's Runonce key.
Several files referred to in this key have not been copied to the destination
computer during SP4 installation, and this generates the error messages listed
earlier in this article.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install SP4 from a DFS share, several hundred files do not get copied
to the destination computer.

Additional query words: 4.00
