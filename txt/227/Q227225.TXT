SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a table of contents entry field (that is, a TC field) that
contains quoted material at the end of the TC field, the table of contents shows
the entry concluding with a backslash (\) rather than a set of quotation marks
as its final character.

This behavior occurs when the "Straight quotes" with "smart quotes" option is not
selected (on the Tools menu, point to AutoCorrect, click the AutoFormat As You
Type tab, and look under "Replace as you type").

For example, the following item in the document

Use of the Phrase "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

appears in the TC field as

{TC "Use of the Phrase \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" "}

and appears in the table of contents as:

Use of the Phrase "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\

WORKAROUND
==========

Place a period between the final two sets of quotation marks.

{TC "Use of the Phrase \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"."}

MORE INFORMATION
================

The backslashes in the field indicate to Word that the quotation marks are to
appear in the table of contents and that they do not indicate the end of the
material. If the backslashes are not present, the text that appears in the table
of contents ends with the second set of quotation marks. In the above example,

Use of the Phrase

would appear in the table of contents.
