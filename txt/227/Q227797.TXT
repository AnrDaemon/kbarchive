======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a domain controller is renamed or taken offline in Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0 while it is performing as a logon point, it may continue to log
numerous error messages in the Site System Status. These errors are related to
the inability of the site server to communicate with the non-existent server.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
   Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the server's machine account from the domain
by using the Server Manager utility. After 7 days of not being able to contact
the server, the Microsoft Windows NT Logon Server Manager component on the site
server should remove all references to this computer.

In some cases, the server might retain an "SMS component server" status even
though there are no site system components assigned to it. If this occurs, you
may delete the server from the Site Systems folder under Site Settings in the
SMS Administrator tool.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 3.
