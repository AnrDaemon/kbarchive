SUMMARY
=======

When Windows Load Balancing Service (WLBS) hosts that are operating in Unicast
mode are connected directly to a switch, WLBS hides the virtual media access
control (MAC) address by default so that the switch does not map the MAC address
to a port. This is necessary because traffic to the virtual IP (VIP) address
must reach all WLBS cluster hosts.

As indicated in the WLBS configuration documentation, only TCP/IP should be bound
to the virtual network adapter. If another protocol is bound to the virtual
network adapter, the other protocol may send frames out through the network
adapter, not giving the WLBS driver a chance to mask the virtual MAC address.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Network Load Balancing (NLB) driver in Windows 2000 Advanced Server and
Datacenter Server is implemented as a filter and other protocols are not able to
bypass it. NLB is then able to mask the virtual MAC address.
