TITLE   :SMS: "All Tasks" List May Be Incomplete When Activated on Query
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200preSP3fix kbsms200SP3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you right-click a resource that appears in the results pane of a query and
then point to All Tasks, the available tasks differ from those that appear when
you right-click the same resource from a collection and then point to All Tasks.

CAUSE
=====

Any query created by the query builder that does not have simple property access
to the ResourceID property does not have access to some tasks. For example, the
query returns a subset of the sms_r_system properties, and the subset does not
contain the ResourceID property or it returns multiple embedded generic objects.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
   Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

When possible, include the ResourceID property in your queries.

   -or-

Use queries to locate resources, and then find the same resource in one of the
collections folders. From the collection results, right-click the object, point
to All Tasks, and then click your task.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 3.
