TITLE   :Modifying TCP/IP Fields May Disable DHCP Relay Agent Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP1,4.0 SP2,4.0 SP3,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Windows Server version 4.0 or later on a computer with
only one network adapter, changing any of the TCP/IP properties in Control Panel
causes the DHCP Relay Agent service running on that computer to become disabled.
Consequently, when you restart the computer, the DHCP relay agent service does
not start.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because there was a restriction on having at least two
network adapters to use the DHCP Relay Agent service. This restriction has been
removed. DHCP Relay agent Service is usually run on multihomed computers.
However, in certain specific scenarios, such as an old router that does not
support DHCP RFC 1542, you may want the service configured on a computer with
only one network adapter to forward DHCP packets through unicast to a DHCP
server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:
