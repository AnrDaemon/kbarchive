======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Index Server to run a query and you set the sort method to anything
other than Rank Descending, you do not receive the top matching records and you
may get a different set of files on subsequent requeries.

CAUSE
=====

Sorting on Rank Descending is the only way to get the top matching records from
the catalog when the maximum number of returns is limited. Sorting on anything
other than Rank Descending returns a subset of the total matching documents.

RESOLUTION
==========

If it is necessary to get the best matching records out of the total record set,
change the sort method to Rank Descending.
