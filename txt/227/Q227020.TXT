KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server version 2.0, when you install the Software Metering
components, the installation may fail if the NTFS drive from which the files are
being installed is compressed.

If you enable logging, this failure is logged in the Licsvcfg.log file located in
the \SMS\LOGS folder. Log entries include the following error message:

   Copying C:\SMS\bin\i386\ProductDB.Dll to
   \\<server>\LicMtr\ProductDB.Dll...
   The file installation failed. The license server manager is attempting to
   clean up the target server.

The \\<server>\LicMtr share is created but no files are successfully
copied. During license server manager cleanup, the LicMtr share is removed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
