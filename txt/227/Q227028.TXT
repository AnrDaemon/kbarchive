TITLE   :SMS: LSM Fails to Update the PDC in a Large Domain Mult Sites
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a domain controlled by many Systems Management Server sites, Logon Server
Manager on the site servers may consistently fail to update its own Logon
Configuration File (LCF) on the primary domain controller (PDC).

One LCF file exists for each site that controls the domain:
Smslogon\Sitescfg\<Sitecode>_cfg.lcf. To update its LCF file, Logon Server
Manager must gain exclusive access to the PDC by exclusively opening the
Nt_logon.tok file, located in the Smslogon\Sitescfg directory.

Logon Server Manager logs the following error in its Nt_logon.log file each time
it fails to open the Nt_logon.tok file on the PDC:

   ~Warning Unable to get sole access to domain skipping
   $$<SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER>

This failure prevents the Logon Server Manager from updating its LCF file. If a
Systems Management Server site server is unable to update its LCF file within
the polling interval plus four hours, the Systems Management Server site is
marked with 'inactive' in its LCF file. If the Systems Management Server site
server is still unable to update its LCF file after the polling interval plus
seven days, then the Systems Management Server site is marked 'dead' and its
directories on the logon points are removed.

If at some point the Systems Management Server site server is able to get access
to the PDC and updates its LCF file, its directories on the logon points will be
re-created. However, the directories will be deleted if Logon Server Manager
consistently fails to get access to the PDC again. This can result in excessive
traffic if you have slow links.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
