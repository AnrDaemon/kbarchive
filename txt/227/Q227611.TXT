SUMMARY
=======

When you set up a new Web site using the HTMLA Web Administration Forms, you are
presented with the new Site operators can administer this site remotely option,
which is not available in the MMC. If this option is checked, it will create an
IISADMIN virtual directory (like the one under the Default Web Site) in order
for the site operator to use the HTMLA Web Administration Forms on the site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To access the HTMLA Web Administration Forms, the operator can go to a Web
browser and simply type "http://sitename/IISADMIN." This only allows the
operator to administer their own site.

The administrator (or Web admin) of the Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0
computer can still administer the site via the Administration Site set up when
IIS is installed.

Note: This option is not available for new virtual directories.

Additional query words: HTMLA Operators iis
