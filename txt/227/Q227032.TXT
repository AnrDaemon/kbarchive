SUMMARY
=======

When advertising a program to a collection you may find other clients in your
site executing the program even though they are not in the targeted collection.
Not only will the clients execute the program but they will also create a status
message stating the success or failure of the program that was executed. For
example, if you advertise to a collection that contains fifty client machines
and you receive over fifty status messages stating that the program was run, you
can safely assume that clients that were not in the collection ran the program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The most plausible reason for this problem to occur is having clients that were
installed under a previous site with the same site code. The Offer Data Provider
(ODP) on the client looks for the existence of the following lookup files on the
local machine during its polling cycle:

 - The lookup file for the System Resource type:
   <WINDIR>\MS\SMS\CLICOMP\SWDIST32\CAP\<SiteCode>Systm.lkp

 - The lookup file for the User Resource type:
   <WINDIR>\MS\SMS\CLICOMP\SWDIST32\CAP\<USERNAME>\<SiteCode>User.lkp

 - The lookup file for the User Group Resource type:
   <WINDIR>\MS\SMS\CLICOMP\SWDIST32\CAP\<USERNAME>\<SiteCode>Usrgp.lkp

If the ODP finds a lookup file on the local machine it will use it instead of the
lookup file on the CAP. The lookup file contains information about which
instruction file the client is to use. If the client was installed under a
different site it would most likely use a different instruction file than the
one it should be using under the new site. To verify if you have clients using
the wrong instruction complete the following steps:

 - Open up the local lookup files located on the client in Notepad and note
   which instruction files are being referenced.

 - Open up the lookup files on the CAP using Notepad to search for the same
   resource (System, User or User Group) and reference which instruction file is
   being used.

 - If the lookup files on the CAP list different instruction files for the same
   resource than the lookup files on the client, the client is using an out of
   date lookup file.

To resolve this problem either delete all of the lookup files on the client or
uninstall and then reinstall the Systems Management Server components on that
particular machine.

A package can be created that will search for and delete all files that have an
.lkp extension in the <WINDIR>\MS\SMS\CLICOMP\SWDIST32 directory on the
client. Advertise this package/program to all clients in your site. The next
time you advertise a program to these clients a new local lookup file will be
created that will point these clients to the correct instruction file.
