SYMPTOMS
========

When a graphical object like a chart is copied from a Microsoft Office
application and pasted into a page in FrontPage Editor, smudges may appear
around any text on the image.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by the converter that FrontPage uses to import images.

WORKAROUND
==========

Method 1: Use an Image Editor
-----------------------------

Paste the object into an image editor, like Image Composer, and save it as a JPG
file. Insert the saved JPG file in FrontPage Editor by clicking Image from the
Insert menu.

Method 2
--------

In Office 97 only, save the Office object using the Save as HTML command from the
File menu, and insert the HTM page in your FrontPage Web.
