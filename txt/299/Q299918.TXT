======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A memory leak occurs in Visual FoxPro (VFP) versions 5.0 and 6.0 when you open
the Connection designer from the Database designer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro version 7.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In VFP 5.0 or 6.0, paste the following code in a new program:

   *!* Q299918 FIX: Memory Leak Calling Connection Designer from Database Designer
   #DEFINE DBCNAME "Q299918"
   LOCAL lni

   *!* CD to the DIR containing this .PRG
   CD SUBSTR(SYS(16),1, ATC("\",SYS(16),OCCURS("\",SYS(16))))
   CLEAR
   CLOSE DATABASES ALL
   *!* Clean-up old database
   ERASE Q299918.*

   CREATE DATABASE DBCNAME
   CREATE CONNECTION Connection1 CONNSTRING "TEST"

   FOR lni = 1 TO 10
   	KEYBOARD '{alt+d}o{enter}{enter}{alt+f4}{ctrl+w}'
   	MODIFY DATABASE
           && Store counter here because it will survive CLEAR ALL
           _CALCMEM = lni  
   	CLEAR ALL
   	? "Memory Handles Used:", SYS(1011), "User Object Memory Use:", SYS(1016)
   	LOCAL lni
   	lni = _CALCMEM
   ENDFOR
   CLOSE DATABASES ALL

2. Save and run the code (the name is unimportant).

When run, the code creates a database and a connection. It then opens and closes
the Connection designer 10 times from the Database designer. After the code
finishes, the current values of SYS(1011) (number of memory handles) and of
SYS(1016) (user object memory use) are printed to _SCREEN. Note that in VFP 5.0
and 6.0, there is a leak of approximately 2 handles and 400 bytes of memory per
iteration.
