======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the SNA Server Shared Folder Gateway service and the Network Associates
McShield service are set to automatically start after a server has been
restarted, a conflict arises. The Shared Folder Gateway service and Network
Associates McShield start without errors; however, the following error occurs
when accessing drives that are mapped to an AS/400 by the Shared Folder Gateway
service:

   the drive is not accessible, the parameter is not correct

This problem occurs when you install Network Associates McAfee NetShield for
Windows NT and Windows 2000 version 4.5 on a Windows NT 4.0 system that has the
SNA Server 4.0 Shared Folders Gateway service installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set the Network Associates McShield service to
start manually by using the Control Panel Services applet. You can then manually
start the Network Associates McShield service to enable virus scanning.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Network Associates has released a formal issue on May 17, 2001 that states,
"NetShield for Windows NT 4.5 is not supported in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 SNA
Server."
