TITLE   :XADM: Information Store Access Violation with Virus Scanning API
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP3,5.5 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange550preSP5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you install antivirus software that is based on the virus scanning
application programming interface (API) on an Exchange Server 5.5 computer, the
Information Store service may stop unexpectedly because of an access violation.

The User.dmp file or, if proper symbols are installed, the Drwatson.log file may
contain a call stack that is similar to the following:

   

   FramePtr ReturnAd Param#1  Param#2  Param#3  Param#4  Function Name
   21b9f954 004f7018 000011f4 21b9fa10 00000000 21b9faa4 store!DwOpenRetryDelay [omap]  (FPO: [0,0,1])

   21b9fa18 0040f25e 00000002 000028e1 24070834 21b9fd18 store!EcQueryRows [omap]  (FPO: [EBP 0x1f94e948] [2,6,4])
   1f94e948 1f94e948 72660001 0000431d 00000000 00000000 store!EcRpc [omap]

CAUSE
=====

The information store process calls the virus-scanning interface to enable the
antivirus software to scan the messages. This problem can occur if the virus
scanning interface becomes NULL for a short time (for example, during the
automatic update of the antivirus software). If the virus-scanning interface
calls the virus-scanning interface during that time, an access violation occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Information store

+-------------------------+
| File name | Version     | 
+-------------------------+
| Store.exe | 5.5.2655.37 | 
+-------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, this fix requires Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 4.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
