MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. On the Project menu, select Components, select the Microsoft Windows Common
   Controls 6.0 library check box, and then click OK.

3. Add a ListView control to Form1.

4. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

   Option Explicit

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       Dim i As Integer
       Dim o As Object

       ListView1.View = lvwReport
       ListView1.FullRowSelect = True

       For i = 1 To 2
           ListView1.ColumnHeaders.Add , , "Column " & i
       Next i

       ' Set the alignment of column two to the right.
       ListView1.ColumnHeaders(2).Alignment = lvwColumnRight

       Set o = ListView1.ListItems.Add(, , "Item1")
       
       ' Place a blank space in column two of row two.
       Set o = ListView1.ListItems.Add(, , "Item2")
       o.ListSubItems.Add , , " "
   End Sub

5. Press the F5 key to run the program. Notice that when you select row one in
   the ListView control, column two is not highlighted. However, when you select
   row two, column two is highlighted because it contains a space.
