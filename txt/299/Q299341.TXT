TITLE   :FIX: Rounding Error Saving Calculated Value into Integer

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a calculated value is written into an integer field in a table, the value may
be rounded improperly and stored incorrectly. For example, if X = 2.05 * 100,
when X is added to an integer field, the actual value stored to the table is
204.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 7.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Copy the following code to a new program:

   CLEAR
   LOCAL lnCalcedVal
   lnCalcedVal = 2.05 * 100

   CREATE CURSOR TstCurs (iFLD1 i)
   INSERT INTO TstCurs VALUES(lnCalcedVal)
   ? "2.05 * 100"
   ? "----------------"
   ? "Calculated Value:",lnCalcedVal
   ? "Value inserted into table:",TstCurs.iFLD1

   USE IN TstCurs

2. Save and run the code (the program name does not matter).

When the code runs, 2.05 * 100 is stored to a local variable, lnCalcedVal. This
variable is then inserted into an integer field in a cursor. The output on the
screen shows the value of lnCalcedVal and the contents of the cursor's integer
field. Note that the two values are different.
