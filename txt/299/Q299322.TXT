======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a program makes repeated calls to the AddObject and RemoveObject methods,
the following error message may be received:

   Too Many Names Used

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro is not releasing unused names from the internal names table used
to keep track of created objects.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 7.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Paste the following code in a new program:

   ON KEY LABEL F5 DO CleanUp
   CLEAR ALL
   CLEAR

   LOCAL lcVarName,  lni, loCont
   PUBLIC glKeepGoing
   loCont = CREATEOBJECT("Container")
   glKeepGoing = .T.
   lni = 0

   DO WHILE glKeepGoing
   	lni = lni+1
   	lcVarName = "ln" + SYS(2015)
   	loCont.ADDOBJECT(lcVarName ,"Line")
   	loCont.REMOVEOBJECT(lcVarName)
   	IF MOD(lni,500) = 0
   		? lni, SYS(1011), SYS(1016)
   		_CALCMEM = lni && The Calculator Memory will persist 
                                  && through the following CLEAR ALL.
   		CLEAR ALL
   		LOCAL loCont, lni, lcVarName
   		glKeepGoing = .T.
   		loCont = CREATEOBJECT("Container")
   		lni = INT(_CALCMEM)
   	ENDIF
   ENDDO

   PROCEDURE CleanUp
   	glKeepGoing = .F.
   	ON KEY LABEL F5
   ENDPROC

2. Save and then run the code (the program name is not important).

   You can press F5 at any time to end the running program. The numbers printed
   to the screen are loop iterations. They show the value of SYS(1011) (Number
   of Memory Handles) and the value of SYS(1016) (User Object Memory Use). The
   error occurs when the number of iterations reaches around 64000.
