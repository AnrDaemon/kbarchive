TITLE   :Passport Manager Object Misconfigured
PRODUCT :Microsoft Developer Network
PROD/VER::1.3,1.4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you browse to a Passport site, you may receive the following error
message:

   Passport Manager object misconfigured

CAUSE
=====

The error is usually caused by an incorrect registry key value, or by missing or
corrupted encryption keys.

RESOLUTION
==========

Try reloading the page once; there are occasionally lingering configuration
issues that appear only the first time that a Passport Manager object is
initiated on a server.

If the error appears again, check the registry key values by using the Passport
Manager Administration utility and verify that all configuration values are
correct. The encryption keys that you received at registration may have to be
reinstalled on your Web server if you have recently reinstalled the Passport
Software Development Kit (SDK).

Verify that you are following the instructions that are provided with the key
installation program.
