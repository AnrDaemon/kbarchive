MORE INFORMATION
================

COM supplies functions to reclaim memory held by DLLs containing components.
CoFreeUnusedLibrariesEx unloads any DLLs that are no longer in use and whose
specified unload delay has expired.

CoFreeUnusedLibrariesEx is available in Windows XP and later systems. On earlier
Windows systems, use the CoFreeUnusedLibraries function, which has a ten-minute
delay for multithreaded apartments (MTAs) and neutral apartments (NAs), and no
delay for single-threaded apartments (STAs).
