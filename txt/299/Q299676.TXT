This issue can occur if the Exchange Server computer has been installed with the

have been modified from their original state.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue if you know the correct organization, server or site name,
modify the appropriate registry value:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the appropriate value (Enterprise, Server or Site) under the following
   key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click String, modify the value to match the correct
   organization (enterprise), server or site name, and then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

NOTE: The Exchange Server organization, server and site names are case sensitive.
Make sure that you type the correct name and case for each value. If another
Exchange Server computer exists in the same site, you can compare the values
from the X500 DN registry value that is found in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters
