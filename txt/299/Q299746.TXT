MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.prg) file.

   *!* Q299746 PRB: F1 Help Doesn't Work With OLEControls
   loForm = CREATEOBJECT("testForm")
   loForm.Show(1)

   DEFINE CLASS testForm AS Form

   	Top = 10
   	Left = 10
   	Height = 150
   	Width = 200
   	
   	Caption = "OLEControl Help form"
   	
   	ADD OBJECT oleTest AS oleControl WITH ;
   		Top = 10, ;
   		Left = 10, ;
   		Height = 120, ;
   		Width = 80, ;
   		OLEClass = "MSComctLlib.TreeCtrl", ;
   		Name = "oleTest"
   		
   	ADD OBJECT cmdTest AS commandbutton WITH ;
   		Top = 50, ;
   		Left = 100, ;
   		Caption = "OK", ;
   		Name = "cmdTest"
   		
   	PROCEDURE Init
   		*!* Replace the file below with an appropriate help file 
   		*!* for your system.
   		SET HELP TO d:\vfp3\foxhelp.hlp
   		
   		*!* Uncomment the next line for the workaround.
   		*!* ON KEY LABEL F1 HELP
   	ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

2. Note that the focus is on the TreeView control and press F1. Nothing happens.

3. Press TAB to move the focus to the command button, and press F1 again. The
   Help file that you specified in Form.Init starts.

4. Close the form, uncomment the ON KEY LABEL statement in the Init method, and
   run the program again. This time Help starts no matter which control has the
   focus.
