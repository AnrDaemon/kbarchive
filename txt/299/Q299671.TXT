TITLE   :Convert.exe Tool Causes Desktop Shortcuts to Prompt for Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After a partition has been converted to NTFS from FAT by using the Convert.exe
utility, users that are not administrators and try to start a program by using a
desktop shortcut are prompted for the administrator password, and then receive
the following error message:

   Incorrect password or unknown user name for \\computer name\C$

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because desktop shortcuts that were created before a
partition has been converted by using the Convert.exe tool do not work.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, delete the desktop shortcuts that do now work, and
then recreate them as needed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you provide the administrator password when you are prompted to do so, the
program starts normally. However, if the computer is rebooted or the secure
connection is broken, the problem reoccurs.
