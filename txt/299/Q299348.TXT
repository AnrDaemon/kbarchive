TITLE   :ASP Script Error w/Attempt to Access User Core Profile Attribute
PRODUCT :Microsoft Developer Network
PROD/VER::1.4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, version 1.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to access a specific user core profile attribute displays a "No such
attribute" Active Server Pages (ASP) script error.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you attempt to retrieve a value for a field attribute
that does not exist in the core profile table.

Attributes are never removed from the core profile, but they may be added when
you make a change and then distribute updated Component Configuration Document
(CCD) files to each participant site by using built-in update capabilities of
the Passport Manager object. A call to such a new attribute results in this same
scripting error if the CCD is not properly updated.

RESOLUTION
==========

For specific tips on debugging CCD refresh failures, see the following Microsoft
Passport Software Development Kit (SDK) Web site:

   Troubleshooting: Windows NT Events
   http://www.passport.com/sdkdocuments/sdk14/reference/operations/troubleshooting_events.htm

Also, make sure that the attribute that you are using is of the expected type or
can be coerced into the expected type. For more information on data types for
Passport profile attributes, see the following Passport SDK Web site:

   Core Profile Table
