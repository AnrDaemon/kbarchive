The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a class by using the DEFINE CLASS command that has the same name
as one of the Visual FoxPro (VFP) base classes, you receive the following error
message when the class is instantiated:

   OLE error code 0x80020006: Unknown name.

CAUSE
=====

Custom classes cannot have the same name as base classes. If you try to compile
the project into a dynamic-link library (DLL), you receive the following error
message:

   Class name is invalid.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro version 7.0 for Windows.
