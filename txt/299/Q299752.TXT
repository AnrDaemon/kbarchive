The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4, 1.99, 2.0, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you edit the Component Configuration Document (CCD), your site functions
incorrectly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The CCD is used by the Microsoft Passport Nexus to make sure that your site has
all of the latest configuration updates. At the heart of the Microsoft Passport
network is the Passport Nexus, which facilitates synchronization of Passport
participant sites to ensure that each site has the latest details on network
configuration and other issues. Each Passport component (for example, Passport
Manager, Login servers, and Update servers) periodically communicates with the
Nexus to retrieve the information it needs to locate, and to properly
communicate with, the other components in the Passport network.

Do not edit the CCD. Editing the CCD causes your site to function incorrectly and
with unpredictable results. The CCD document is designed to receive updates from
the Passport Nexus only. Do not set the CCD to read-only or set file permissions
that prevent it from being overwritten.
