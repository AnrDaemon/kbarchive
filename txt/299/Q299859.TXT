TITLE   :Cannot Find Product Key for Installing the Passport SDK
PRODUCT :Microsoft Developer Network
PROD/VER::1.3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, version 1.3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the installation of the Passport Software Development Kit (SDK), you may
be prompted to enter the product key. If the product key is not entered, the SDK
installation stops.

CAUSE
=====

The product key is needed to complete the installation of the Passport SDK.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you downloaded the Passport SDK from the Passport Developer Info site, you
should have seen a Web page that displayed a product key before you downloaded
the installation executable file. If you received the Passport SDK files in
another format (such as an installation CD), the product key should be found on
the CD itself or with its packaging.

If you do not remember and cannot locate your Passport SDK product key, see the
following Passport Web site:

   http://www.passport.com/devinfo/

Follow the links to download the Passport SDK. On the download page, you will see
a product key that you can use. It is not necessary to download the executable
file again. The product key is derived from your Passport sign-in information;
it is unique for you and does not change over time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Passport SDK version 1.4.1 and later do not require a product key for
installation.
