TITLE   :PRB: "Error in Loading DLL" Error If You Add PDW as VB Component
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbAddin kbwizard kbAppSetup kbDeployment kbide kbVBp kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you select the "Package and Deployment Wizard" check box from the Components
dialog box in a Visual Basic project and then click either OK or Apply, you
receive the following error message:

   Error in loading DLL

CAUSE
=====

If you select the "Package and Deployment Wizard" check box in the Components
dialog box, Visual Basic tries to load the PDWizard.ocx file. However,
PDWizard.ocx is not intended for use as a component in a Visual Basic project;
it is designed to be used by the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) Add-In.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, load the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) as an
add-in, or start the PDW as a stand-alone program. For step-by-step
instructions, see the "More Information" section.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic 6.0.

2. From the Project menu, click Components, select the "Package and Deployment
   Wizard" check box, and then click OK. You receive the above-mentioned error
   message.

How to Load the PDW as an Add-In
--------------------------------

1. From the Add-Ins menu in Visual Basic 6.0, click Add-In Manager.

2. In the list, click "Package and Deployment Wizard". Under Load Behavior,
   select the "Loaded/Unloaded" check box, and then click OK.

3. Save the project.

   NOTE: If you try to load the PDW as an Add-In without first saving the current
   project, you receive the following error message, and the wizard does not
   start:

   The active project must be saved before it can be packaged and deployed.

4. From the Add-Ins menu, click "Package and Deployment Wizard" to start the
   PDW.

How to Start the PDW as a Stand-Alone Program
---------------------------------------------

To start the PDW outside of Visual Basic, on the Microsoft Windows Start menu,
point to Programs, point to Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0, point to Microsoft
Visual Studio 6.0 Tools, and then click Package and Deployment Wizard.
