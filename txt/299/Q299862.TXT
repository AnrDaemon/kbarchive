The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Passport-enabled pages can potentially serve both HTTPS and HTTP content within
the same page, but do so only if there is an error in either cobranding or
LogoTag2 method calls.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some browsers display a warning dialog box in this situation, depending on
security settings. If you are serving HTTPS pages and using the Passport Manager
object's LogoTag2 method, make sure to set the bSecure parameter to True to
serve the Sign-in or Sign-out image links from a Passport HTTPS image server.
Also check your cobranding elements, including elements that are called as
images and the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) or cobranding template files.
