The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4

SUMMARY
=======

A Passport Manager object that is installed on a particular server can be given
different defaults, behaviors, encryption keys, and Site IDs so that a single
object can be used for multiple sites that are being served from a single server
computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Run the Passport Manager Administration utility. To do this, click Start,
   point to Programs, point to Microsoft Passport, and then click Passport
   Manager Administration Utility.

2. In the Passport Manager Administration Utility, click New. The Add New Web
   Site dialog box appears.

3. In the Web Site Name field, type a new friendly name for the site. The value
   that you type for Web Site Name should match the site name that is specified
   as the /s parameter if encryption keys that are designated for a particular
   site name have already been installed or will be installed. For details and
   the purpose of the /s parameter when installing keys, see the following
   Passport Web site:

   Installing the Encryption Key
   http://www.passport.com/sdkdocuments/sdk14/Implementation/enckey.htm

   NOTE: It is best to not use names that contain spaces when you specify the Web
   site name. If you do, you must enclose the string in quotation marks when you
   specify as the /s value, and you must encode the spaces out of the value if
   you specify it as vSiteName.

4. For Host Name, type a host name and IP address. This value should be the
   server host name that this particular Passport-enabled site resolves to. If
   the site uses a port other than 80, specify the port number along with the
   host name in a single string (for example, hostname:port#).

5. For Host IP, type an IP address. The IP address is the resolving IP number
   for the site.

6. Click Commit Changes to enable the new site configuration.
