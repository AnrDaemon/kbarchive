SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a profile in Outlook 2000, when you try to use the Check Name
option to verify the name of the Exchange Server and the mailbox, you may
receive the following error message:

   The name could not be resolved. The name could not be matched to a name in
   the address list.

This error message does not appear if you are logged in as the System
Administrator or if you are using an account that has Administrator rights.

account:
