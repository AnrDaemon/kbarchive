SYMPTOMS

When you browse to the Passport Login server, you may receive the following
error message:

   Error 80004005, Network Server Objects Not Initialized!

CAUSE

This error occurs when there is a problem with the domain authority.

Login server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Passport Manager stand-alone mode was created for use in the event of a
long-term outage of Microsoft Passport network servers due to extraordinary
circumstances. In such circumstances, participant sites may need to disconnect
temporarily from the Passport network. Passport Manager allows operators to
"shift" into stand-alone mode. An operator can set this mode by using the
Passport Manager Administration utility.
