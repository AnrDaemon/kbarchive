The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Cookies are not deleted for my site when the Passport user closes the browser
window.

CAUSE
=====

If cookies are not deleted when a Passport user closes the browser window, one
of the following may be the cause:

 - The user has more than one window open to your site, or the site creates
   multiple window instances when users view it.

   Some Microsoft Internet Explorer versions earlier than 5.0 consider a browser
   session to be open as long as any browser window is open. Also, certain
   factors cause new browser windows to launch out of the same process as an
   already open process, and as part of propagating the session, various cookies
   or permissions may be propagated from the parent to the child. Because of
   this, the session can still be "live" after one or more browser windows have
   been closed, even if the remaining windows are no longer viewing a Passport
   site.

 - The user has selected the Remember my Password or Keep Me Signed In option.

   If the user has selected the Remember my Password or Keep Me Signed In option,
   the domain-authority cookies become persistent cookies that are saved on the
   browser. Depending on your implementation, a saved password may mean that the
   participant cookies can be refreshed silently when the user returns to your
   site.
