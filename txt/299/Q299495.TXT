SUMMARY
=======

The first time a Passport user connects to a Passport express purchase Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) page, the browser may display an acceptance dialog box for
the security certificate.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is required for SSL-served pages. Users must accept this certificate to
continue. During the sign-in process at the Passport Login server, there is
another SSL connection that writes the "ticket-granting" cookie. It also
requires the acceptance of a certificate. Your own SSL-served pages may require
yet another certificate-acceptance step. After certificates have been accepted
by a client browser user, the dialog box does not appear again unless the
certificates expire or are specifically revoked by the certificate-issuing
agency.
