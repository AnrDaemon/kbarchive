TITLE   :FP: Include Component, Shared Borders Incorrect on UNIX
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - SharePoint Team Services from Microsoft 
 - FrontPage 2002 Server Extensions from Microsoft 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 2002 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 2000 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade your UNIX-based site to the FrontPage 2002 Server Extensions,
the shared borders and Include components do not appear correctly. The body of
the main page appears as part of the shared border or the Include component,
giving the appearance of duplicating data throughout the page.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if a performance tuning setting (such as the Max Cache
Document Size setting) on the server is configured incorrectly. For information
about how to configure performance tuning settings, see the "More Information"
section later in this article.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the configuration settings that affect the
performance tuning options. To do this, follow these steps:

Global Settings
---------------

IMPORTANT: Because these settings affect all sites on your server, follow these
steps carefully.

1. Log on to your UNIX server with root privileges.

2. Open the following directory:

   /usr/local/frontpage/version5.0

3. In a text editor, open the Frontpage.cnf file.

4. Locate the following lines and delete them:

   CacheMaxDocMeta
   CacheMaxImage
   CacheMaxInclude
   CacheMaxIncludeSize
   CacheMinDocMeta

5. Save and close the file. Quit the text editor program.

6. Recalculate any affected Webs on the server.

Site-Specific Settings
----------------------

For each site that continues to experience problems, follow these additional
steps:

1. Log on to your UNIX server with root privileges.

2. Open the following directory:

   /usr/local/frontpage

   There should be at least one configuration file in this directory, although
   there could be several. File names of configuration files on multihosted
   systems have the following syntax:

   my.host.name:PPP.cnf

   where my.host.name is the fully qualified domain name of the server and PPP is
   the port number of the Web server.

   File names of configuration files on a single-host system have the following
   syntax:

   wePPP.cnf

   where PPP is the port number of the Web server.

3. In a text editor, open the file that corresponds to the affected Web server.

4. Locate the following lines and delete them:

   CacheMaxDocMeta
   CacheMaxImage
   CacheMaxInclude
   CacheMaxIncludeSize
   CacheMinDocMeta

5. Save and close the file. Quit the text editor.

6. Recalculate any affected Webs on the specific Web site.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
