======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have a label on a form in Visual FoxPro (VFP) 5.0 or 6.0, and the label
is disabled (Enabled = .F.) and its caption is wrapped (WordWrap = .T.), the
label may appear to have extra words in its caption.

CAUSE
=====

Only one of the two colors that make up the 3D disabled effect actually wraps.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro version 7.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In VFP 5.0 or 6.0, paste the following code in a new program.

   *!* Q299507 FIX: Disabled Label On a Form Only Wraps One of Two Colors
   LOCAL loForm
   loForm = CREATEOBJECT("frmLblDemo")
   loForm.lblDemo.ENABLED = .F.
   loForm.SHOW(1)

   DEFINE CLASS frmLblDemo AS FORM
   	ADD OBJECT lblDemo AS DemoLabel
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS DemoLabel AS LABEL
   	CAPTION  = 'This is a demo'
   	WORDWRAP = .T.
   	HEIGHT   = 100
   	WIDTH    = 82
   	TOP      = 100
   	LEFT     = 100
   ENDDEFINE

2. Save and run the code (the name is unimportant).

When this code is run, a new form appears. The form has one object, a label,
which is disabled and has its WordWrap property set to .T.. Using the "Windows
Standard" color scheme in Microsoft Windows, in VFP 5.0 and 6.0 the word "demo"
appears twice in the label caption: once on the first line (in gray) and once on
the second line (in white). However, the caption property of the label does not
contain extra text.
