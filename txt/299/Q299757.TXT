TITLE   :Train Simulator: Can't Restore Minimized Window w/Double-Click
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Train Simulator, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you minimize the Microsoft Train Simulator window to the taskbar, and then
double-click the Train Simulator icon to maximize it, the program unexpectedly
opens in Window mode, and you cannot move the mouse pointer over it as expected.

RESOLUTION
==========

To restore Train Simulator to Full Screen mode, move your mouse pointer behind
the current Train Simulator window, and then click once.

NOTE: When you move the pointer into the space of the Train Simulator window
(when it is in Window mode), the pointer disappears "under" the window. At this
point, click once to expand the window to Full Screen mode. You can now position
your pointer over the window as expected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent this behavior from occurring, click the Train Simulator taskbar icon
once. Do not double-click it.
