======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Visual FoxPro (VFP) DataToClip() application method is used to store
data from a DateTime field to the clipboard, the data is truncated, leaving off
the trailing "M" in AM or PM.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro version 7.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Visual FoxPro (VFP) 5.0 or 6.0, paste the following code in a new program:

   CLEAR
   LOCAL lcOldSetCentury
   lcOldSetCentury = SET("CENTURY")

   CREATE CURSOR TstCursor (fldDTime T)
   INSERT INTO TstCursor VALUES (DATETIME())

   _VFP.DATATOCLIP
   ? _CLIPTEXT

   SET CENTURY ON

   _VFP.DATATOCLIP
   ? _CLIPTEXT

   USE IN TstCursor
   SET CENTURY &lcOldSetCentury

2. Save and run the program (the name is not important).

This program creates a new cursor with a DateTime field and stores DATETIME to
that field. The value from that field is then stored to the clipboard using
_VFP.DataToClip, and the contents of the clipboard are printed to _SCREEN. This
is done twice: once with CENTURY off and once with CENTURY on.

In VFP 5.0 and 6.0 the DateTime values that are stored to the clipboard are
truncated and are missing the "M" in the AM/PM portion of the text. As a result,
this code prints incomplete strings to _SCREEN in those VFP versions.
