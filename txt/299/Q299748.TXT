TITLE   :Train Simulator: Contradictory Messages During Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Train Simulator, version 1.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Train Simulator on a Microsoft Windows 95-based
system that has Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or earlier installed, you may
receive a message to restart the system, followed by a message that you should
not shut down during the installation of the program.

CAUSE
=====

For the installation process to proceed under the configuration described in the
"Symptoms" section of this article, you must first install Internet Explorer
5.5. This requires additional steps and subsequent restarts before the
installation of DirectX or the Train Simulator program itself. This is the
expected behavior on a Windows 95-based system with Internet Explorer 4.0
installed on it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, perform the following steps:

Install Microsoft Internet Explorer
-----------------------------------

1. Insert the Train Simulator disk #2 into the CD-ROM drive. Press and hold down
   SHIFT when you insert the CD-ROM to prevent the program from starting
   automatically.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type "<cd-rom>:\ie5\ie5setup.exe" (without the
   quotation marks) (where <cd-rom> is the drive letter for the CD-ROM
   drive that contains the Train Simulator CD-ROM), and then click OK.

4. Follow the instructions on the screen to install Internet Explorer 5.5.

If the problem continues to occur, proceed to the next step:
