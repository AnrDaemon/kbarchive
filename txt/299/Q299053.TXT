TITLE   :MapPoint 2002: Program May Hang While Creating Territories
PRODUCT :Microsoft Automap
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MapPoint 2002 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft MapPoint may stop responding (hang) while it attempts to create new
territories.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you create a territory by using ZIP Codes that have
no geographical points, such as one associated with a government building.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use ZIP Codes that have no geographical points that can be mapped.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Point ZIP Codes, such as 01066 in Massachusetts, are ZIP Codes that are assigned
to designated areas, such as government buildings. If a point ZIP Code is within
a regular ZIP Code, it may be mapped. But, if the ZIP Code does not have a
geographical location within the program, MapPoint cannot map it.
