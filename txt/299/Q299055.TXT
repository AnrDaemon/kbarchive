======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MapPoint 2002, used with:
    - Microsoft Office XP (Setup) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you uninstall Microsoft MapPoint 2002, Office Help no longer works as
expected.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if MapPoint 2002 is installed after Microsoft Office XP is
installed. Under these circumstances, the Help files are changed to MapPoint.
When MapPoint is removed, the pointers to the original Office Help files are not
replaced.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, run a repair on Office XP.
