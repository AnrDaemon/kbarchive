TITLE   :SMS: The SMSCliToknAcct& Account May Be Locked Out
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SMSCliToknAcct& account may be locked out on any server that functions
as a Client Access Point (CAP). If security auditing is turned on, the Security
event log may show unsuccessful logon attempts, and may show account lock-outs
with event IDs 529 and 539.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur because SMS clients may sometimes try to connect to CAPs
by using their local SMSCliToknAcct& account. If the domain or server has a
lockout policy in use, the domain or server SMSCliToknAcct& account is
locked out. This prevents Software Distribution from working on domain
controllers or servers that are CAPs.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
