TITLE   :Client Browser Returns to Site w/ f=6 Attached to Query String
PRODUCT :Microsoft Developer Network
PROD/VER::1.4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, version 1.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The client browser returns to my site with an "f=6" attached to the query
string.

CAUSE
=====

Either the Passport Manager object on your Web server is configured to be in
stand-alone mode, or the Passport Login server cannot reach its own Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) pages and cannot write the ticket-granting cookie. Neither
the domain authority nor the Passport Manager object will write cookies, and the
user will not be signed in.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check to see if the Passport Manager object is configured to be in stand-alone
mode. If it is, turn stand-alone mode off to see if the Passport server can be
reached. If the same results occur, there is a problem on the Passport network.
Use the Passport Administration Utility to turn stand-alone mode off.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Other "f=" values in the query string also indicate a possible Passport network
problem. For more information, see the following Microsoft Passport Web site:
