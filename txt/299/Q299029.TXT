PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange550

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Client, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to a logon page for Outlook Web Access (OWA), you
may receive the following error message:

   404 File Not Found

This happens when you use the server name or the local host name in the URL.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the computer does not resolve the server name when a
user tries to gain access to it by using a URL.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, acquire an IP address from your Internet service
provider (ISP), assign the new IP address to the network interface card (NIC),
and then make the applicable DNS entry.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, instruct people to connect to the port on which
the default Web site is set.
