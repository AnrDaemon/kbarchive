SUMMARY
=======

Passport Manager requests the Component Configuration Document (CCD) as XML
through the HTTP protocol, using port 443. Firewalls that prevent outbound or
inbound HTTP prevent the Component Configuration Document from being updated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Passport server is behind a firewall, it may be necessary to introduce a
staging system, in which a computer that bridges the firewall is specified as a
file share and is enabled to refresh the CCD. The refresh can happen at
specified intervals, or the computer can also be Passport Manager-enabled so
that the refresh happens as needed. The file share on the computer can then be
specified as the CCDLocalFile in the Passport node of the registry, and servers
behind the firewall can then share that configuration and remain behind the
firewall.

Checking your CCD file periodically to see if any additions have been made to
core profile attributes is recommended. Locate the Partner.xml document, usually
in the WinNT\system32\MicrosoftPassport folder, and open it in the Microsoft
Internet Explorer browser of your server to view the Passport configuration
attributes. You can check the file date to see when it was last updated or check
the Passport Manager events in Event Viewer to see if a CCD refresh event has
been detected recently.
