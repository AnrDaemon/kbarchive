TITLE   :Passport Login Page Appears in the Wrong Language

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Passport Login page appears in the wrong language.

CAUSE
=====

The Passport network server pages are localized to accommodate many different
languages. The AuthURL2 and LogoTag2 methods of the Passport Manager and
Passport FastAuth objects accept a LangID parameter, which determines the
display language of the Passport Login page that the method output URL points
to. See the "Resolution" section for information on how to determine the cause
of this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the Passport Login page appears in the wrong language, verify the following:

 - Did you send the correct LangID parameter to the LoginUser, AuthURL2, or
   LogoTag2 method?

 - Is the LangID parameter a valid LCID value as specified in the Passport
   Software Development Kit (SDK), or in general Microsoft Platform SDK
   documentation? The Passport Manager Administration utility restricts you to
   known LCIDs when setting the method defaults, but if you specified LCID
   directly as a method parameter it is possible to specify an invalid LCID,
   which does not generate a run-time error in the method. For more information
   about method defaults, see the "More Information" section.

 - Did you provide the value for the LangID parameter in decimal form rather
   than the Win32 programming hexadecimal form, or as string? LangID is presumed
   to be in decimal form, although you can specify it in hex form using
   language-specific hex representations. For example, &H0409 in Microsoft
   Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) is equivalent to the decimal value
   1033.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although some parameters of Microsoft Passport methods are listed as optional,
those methods generate URLs or results that reflect inherent default values when
they are called. These default parameter values can be used to provide
consistent site-wide values, such as Language ID. Use the Passport Manager
Administration utility to set these defaults.

If a certain server on your site is dedicated to a particular language or locale,
it may be useful to set the Language ID on that server to always be a consistent
value rather than declaring the locale identifier (LCID) in each method call.
The Language ID declares the language that Passport service pages (such as
sign-in and registration) render in when they are obtained with the URL results
of the LoginUser, AuthURL2, LogoTag2, or GetDomainAttribute methods. Note that
there may still be reasons to declare LCID by method call or user access if your
site expects to handle multiple languages and uses either Passport profile
information or browser sniffing to determine the user's probable language
choice.
