MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can occur when you attempt to modify the properties of a package
created at a higher-level site in your hierarchy. Because the package was
created at a parent site, it is locked to prevent the child site from modifying
any of its properties. The solution is to define the Distribution Points at the
Parent site in which the package was created. When the clients attempt to run
the advertised package, they will access it from a distribution point for their
respective sites.
