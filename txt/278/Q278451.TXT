The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs with the Visual C++ Resource Editor. When you try to edit or
delete any entries in a string table or accelerator table, only the first entry
in the list is modified.

CAUSE
=====

A hardware driver is typically responsible for this behavior. For example, the
Matrox Millennium G400 Dualhead video card can cause this problem if either the
Center dialog boxes or the MaxVIEW option is selected.

RESOLUTION
==========

For the Matrox Millennium G400 Dualhead video driver:

1. Locate the Start menu item, Matrox PowerDesk NT.

2. Click Matrox Display Properties. (If you do not see this menu item, search
   your hard drive for the Mgapanel.cpl file, and then double-click it.)

3. In the Matrox Display Properties dialog box, click the PowerDesk tab.

4. Make sure that both the Center dialog boxes and MaxVIEW check boxes are not
   selected (are unchecked).

If you are experiencing this problem and you don't have the Matrox Millennium
G400 Dualhead video card, you can determine whether your particular video driver
is at fault. Use the Display application in Control Panel to set the display
driver to a Standard VGA adapter. Alternatively, you can start up in VGA mode on
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 or in safe mode on Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft
Windows 98, Microsoft Windows Me, and Microsoft Windows 2000. Both of those
modes use standard video drivers. If you determine that the video driver is at
fault, obtain an update for your video driver from the video driver
manufacturer's Web site.
