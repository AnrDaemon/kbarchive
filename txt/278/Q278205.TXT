SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based or Microsoft Windows 2000-based computer
is configured to use the Microsoft IntelliPoint version 3.1 or 3.2 mouse
software, the following symptoms may occur:

 - The NUM LOCK and CAPS LOCK keys do not function after a Systems Management
   Server (SMS) client (with the Remote Control Client agent enabled) is
   restarted twice.

 - The keyboard is reset to a 101-key keyboard.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue, edit the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Kbstuff

Change the TAG value from its current setting (usually 3) to 5, and then restart
the computer to restore normal functionality.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
