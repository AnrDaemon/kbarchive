TITLE   :XADM: Event 8285 When Replicating Mailboxes from Exch5.5 to AD
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you set up the Active Directory Connector (ADC) to replicate mailboxes
from Exchange Server 5.5 to Active Directory, the Properties' General tab that
shows the home server for the mailbox for the account is not displayed on some
user accounts.

In addition, the following event may be reported in the application event log:

   Event Type: Warning
   Event Source: MSADC
   Event Category: (1)
   Event ID: 8285
   Date: 10/27/2000
   Time: 5:15:28 PM
   User: N/A
   Computer: Computername
   Description:
   ADC will not replicate from cn=Mailbox,cn=Recipients,ou=Sitename,o=OrgName to
   CN=Mailbox,OU=Users,DC=Domain,DC=local because both objects are not mailbox
   enabled. The source object is a mailbox. The target object is either a
   Contact or a mail enabled user. If this is a problem, consider making the
   Connection Agreement an Inter-Organizational Connection Agreement.
   (Connection Agreement 'Exchange to Windows' #540)

CAUSE
=====

This issue may occur if the Windows 2000 account already has an e-mail address
associated with it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Start the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in, right-click the
   Windows 2000 account, and then click Properties.

2. Click the General tab, clear the E-mail box, and then click OK.

3. Open the Active Directory Connector snap-in, and click the recipient
   Connection Agreement that is used to replicate that mailbox from Exchange
   Server 5.5 to Active Directory.

4. Right-click Connection Agreement, and then click Replicate Now.

5. Allow enough time for the replication to occur.
