SYMPTOMS
========

If you share folders on a local computer and then access these local file
systems by using their share names, transferring files may be much slower than
when you use local drive and path names.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if TCP/IP is installed as one of the network protocols.
When you use share names to access local file systems, the data passes through
server, redirector, and network protocol code. The TCP/IP loopback code handles
the data inefficiently and causes a bottleneck.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you use NetBEUI as the only protocol, this problem does not occur. Or, if you
use \\<ipaddr>\<sharename> instead of
\\<server>\<sharename>, where <ipaddr> is the local IP address
of your network adapter, the loopback code is not used, avoiding the bottleneck.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Using server, redirector, and networking code adds additional overhead.
Microsoft does not recommend accessing local file systems by using share names.
