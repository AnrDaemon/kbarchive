======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Active Directory Connector (ADC), you may receive the
following error message when you attempt to save a connection agreement between
Windows 2000 and Exchange Server 5.5:

   The credentials specified on the connections tab are incorrect or do not have
   sufficient permissions to access the Exchange 5.5 directory. Please ensure
   that the credentials specified are entered correctly and that sufficient
   permissions are granted in order to access the Exchange 5.5 directory.

   Error ID c103aa11

   Microsoft Active Directory Management.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication is
disabled for the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) setting in
Exchange 5.5.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, enable Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication for
the LDAP setting for either all the servers in the site that are running
Exchange Server, or for only the server that you are trying to make a connection
agreement with.

To enable Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication for the LDAP setting for
all the servers that are running Exchange Server within the site, make the
following changes in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program:

1. Click to expand the <Site Name>\Configuration\Protocols\LDAP
   (Directory) Site Defaults object.

2. Click the Authentication tab and click to select the "Windows NT
   Challenge/Response" check box.

3. Click OK, and then stop and restart the Exchange Server directory service.

To enable Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication for the LDAP setting for
only the server that you are trying to make a connection agreement with, make
the following changes in the Administrator program:

1. Click to expand the <Site
   Name>\Configuration\<Server>\Protocols\LDAP (Directory) Settings
   object.

2. Click the Authentication tab and click to select the "Windows NT
   Challenge/Response" check box.

3. Click the General tab and click to clear the "Use site defaults for all
   properties" check box.

4. Click OK, and then stop and restart the Exchange Server directory service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you use Ldp.exe to connect to the server on which you have disabled Windows
NT Challenge/Response authentication, and then attempt to bind to LDAP, you
receive the following error message:

   Error 7:ldap_bind_s failed: Authentication Method not supported.
