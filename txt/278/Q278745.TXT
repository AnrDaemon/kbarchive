======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a remote Systems Management Server (SMS) component server is offline or
otherwise unreachable over the network when the SMS Site Component Manager
service attempts to contact it, Site Component Manager flags the SMS components
to be reinstalled. When the remote server comes back online, Site Component
Manager reinstalls the SMS components on that computer.

This reinstallation process involves re-creating the service account for the SMS
Executive service on the remote server. Therefore, a new user profile for the
SMSSvc_[site_code]_<xxxx> account is created. Typically, this should not
be a problem. However, if the network link to the remote server is prone to
congestion or down time, the SMS components may be reinstalled frequently. As
the user profiles accumulate, a large amount of disk space may be consumed on
the system drive partition on the remote server.

CAUSE
=====

If a system has been offline, it is reinstalled to ensure that all of the SMS
components are installed and functional.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

   Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

For an SMS component server that is a member server in a domain, the service
account that is used by the SMS Executive service is a local machine account,
not a domain account. For SMS component servers that are domain controllers, the
service account is created in the domain. If there are multiple domain
controllers performing SMS component server roles, there is more than one
SMSSvc_[sitecode]_<xxxx> account in the domain. Do not delete the accounts
manually because SMS does this automatically. The problem is only that the user
profile is not deleted. Therefore, in both situations, you can confirm which
account is in use by examining the startup properties of the SMS Executive
service on a server and delete only the user profiles for the accounts that are
not being used on that server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Currently, only remote site systems that are managed directly by Site Component
Manager are affected by this problem. These include:

 - SMS SQL Server

 - SMS Client Access Point (CAP)

These site systems are not managed directly by Site Component Manager and are not
affected by this problem:

 - SMS Distribution Point

 - Software Metering Server

 - Software Metering Database Server



Note that attempting to install a CAP to a clustered server can cause a similar
problem. CAP reinstallations are not uncommon; attempts to reinstall a CAP to a
clustered server by Site Component Manager do not work because Site Component
Manager cannot find a non-clustered drive. For additional information, visit the
following Microsoft Web site:
