======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 parameter for Default Isolation Level
is set to Cursor Stability (CS), it could be incorrectly mapped by the provider
as Repeatable Read (RR) on DB2. This may lead to the incorrect type of locks
being held on the DB2 tables, which may cause unexpected behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
