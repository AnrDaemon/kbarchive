The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

A poorly formatted inbound Internet message may cause an error in the
information store and start the Dr. Watson debugger. If you are experiencing the
problem addressed in this article, you may receive the following events:

   Event ID: 4116
   Source: MSExchangeIMC

   An error was returned from the messaging software the Internet Mail Service
   uses to process messages on the Microsoft Exchange Server. It is possible
   that the piece of mail being processed at the time will be returned to the
   sender as a failed delivery instead of being delivered. The message will be
   moved to the "BAD" folder, if possible, and the error is not a temporary
   error. Otherwise it will be retried when the service is restarted. Use the
   appropriate utilities found in the SUPPORT directory of your Exchange CD to
   view and manipulate messages that have been moved to the "BAD" folder

   Event ID: 3039

   The error 0x80040115 was encountered while trying to communicate with the
   message store. An attempt to refresh the connection will be made. If not
   successful, the service will be shut down.

CAUSE

This problem is caused by an incorrectly formatted Internet message attribute.
If an Internet message received by the Internet Mail Service has an attribute of
CHARSET= " " in the header, the information store generates a Dr. Watson error
during inbound conversion.

======
