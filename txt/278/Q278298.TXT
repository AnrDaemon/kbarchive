TITLE   :Clients Are Not Detected When Network Discovery Is Used
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0,2.0 SP1,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbDiscovery

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server (SMS), when you use Network Discovery, it populates
the IsClient fields in the database with a <Null> value.

For example, when you view an individual computer in the All Systems collection,
the information for the computer may indicate that the value for
SMSUniqueIdentifier is Null. However, Smscfg.ini and the system_data table
indicate that the computer has been assigned a global universal identifier
(GUID).

Additionally, when you check the membership of collections that are based on
client computers in the SMS site, the collection does not return any members.
When you run a query to locate computers that are installed as SMS clients, the
query does not return any results.

When you double-click Systems Management in Control Panel in the workstation, the
client may be displayed. However, the SMS site reports that the client does not
exist. Therefore, installed clients cannot be managed by the SMS site.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because Network Discovery does not attempt to determine if
resources that it discovers are clients of the SMS site.

When Network Discovery is configured as the only discovery method in your SMS
site, computers may install the client components. However, SMS is unaware that
the clients are present.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, reenable the Heartbeat Discovery option (which is enabled
by default) and wait for the specified polling interval to pass. When the
clients send up new discovery data, the database is updated to reflect the
correct values.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMS provides several different ways to discover potentially manageable
resources. Network Discovery is one of these methods, and it is used to discover
both the computer and non-computer resources on the network.
