SYMPTOMS
========

After exporting a secure sockets layer (SSL) Certificate from a Microsoft
Windows 2000 computer in Personal Information Exchange (PFX) format, and then
trying to import that Certificate into Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Key Manager (IIS
4.0), the following error message occurs and the import fails:

   Unable to install the certificate because you did not enter the correct
   password.
   SChannel Error = 80090304

CAUSE
=====

Key Manager is the only way to import, export, or install an SSL Certificate on
Windows NT 4.0. PFX format Certificate exports are a newer technology that
Windows NT 4.0 Key Manager does not recognize. It is possible to import a PFX
file by using Microsoft Internet Explorer; however, this does not properly bind
the public and private SSL keys to any Web sites.

RESOLUTION
==========

Currently there is no way to accomplish this export/import scenario.

WORKAROUND
==========

To be able to freely export and import SSL Certificates to Windows NT 4.0 and
Microsoft Windows 2000, install the certificate on a Windows NT 4.0 server
initially, and then export the Certificate to an *.key file.
