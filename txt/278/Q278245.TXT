SYMPTOMS
========

If a SQL Server Linked Server uses the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 to
access DB2 running on a mainframe computer with a large catalog size, the
four-part query execution may lead to slow performance, or in some cases an
Access Violation with an error message similar to the following:

   SqlDumpExceptionHandler: Process <process number> generated fatal
   exception c0000005 EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION. SQL Server is terminating this
   process. Connection Broken

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

WORKAROUND
==========

To workaround this problem, modify the four-part queries to use the Linked
Server OPENQUERY syntax. For more information on OPENQUERY, please see the SQL
Server books online.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0
SP2 and 4.0 SP3.
