PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbConfig kbMMC kbServer kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbCAP kbsmsAdmin kbStatSum

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the Component Status section in the Microsoft Systems Management
Server (SMS) Administrator console, remote site systems may report incomplete or
incorrect information. The State value may be set to Stopped, and no information
may be reported for the Next Scheduled, Last Started, and Last Message values.

The Component Status Summarizer log (Compsumm.log) reports messages similar to:

   Warn>: Received a status message from SMS_EXECUTIVE, a non-SMS component
   on SERVER1. Ignoring message. $$<SMS_COMPONENT_STATUS_SUMMARIZER>
   Warn>: Received a status message from SMS_INBOX_MANAGER_ASSISTANT, a
   non-SMS component on SERVER1. Ignoring message.
   $$<SMS_COMPONENT_STATUS_SUMMARIZER>

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the Component Status Summarizer does not report
status for remote site systems that have been added manually through the Site
Systems node within the SMS Administrator console, and that contain a lowercase
server or share name.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, always enter remote site systems server or share
names in all uppercase letters. For example, when you add a remote Client Access
Point (CAP) server called "Server1," type the server name as "SERVER1" (without
the quotation marks) (not "Server1" (without the quotation marks) or "server1"
(without the quotation marks)).

If a site system already exists with a lowercase name, follow these steps:

1. Remove any shares or disable all site system roles from the server.

   IMPORTANT: Do not disable the Systems Management Server Component Server role;
   this role cannot be removed from the server.

2. Delete the server from the Site Systems node.

3. Re-create the server or share with an uppercase name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
