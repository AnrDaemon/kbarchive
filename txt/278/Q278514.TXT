KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSN Companion, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While loading a graphic, the unit appears to "hang" with only 25% of the update
complete. Unplugging the unit does not clear the action and the you are unable
to cancel the update.

CAUSE
=====

The MSN Companion unit may require more time when asked to load a graphic.
Downloading the update for a complex graphic can seem an overly lengthy process.

RESOLUTION
==========

Give the unit more time to complete the download updating process.

Remember that the speed of your dial-up connection can be impacted by Internet
traffic congestion. This means that your connection will be slower at a time of
day when many more people are online, or if signals are having to be routed
around an Internet problem somewhere (such as a broken backbone cable or hub).

If after giving the unit more time it seems that there may be a problem with your
unit, please contact MSN Companion Technical Support at (888) 386-6497.
