Your Password

Note: the password for your account is kept on the MSN servers, and a copy of the
password is also stored in your MSN Companion. When MSN Companion connects to
the MSN servers, it uses this stored password to automatically log you into
MSN.

There are rare circumstances when a password will be changed on the MSN servers.
If this is the case, you will not be able to log in to the MSN servers and you
will see an error screen. You will need to change the password that's stored in
the MSN Companion so that it matches the password on the MSN servers.

To change password

1. Click password.

2. In the password text box, type a new password.

3. In the re-type password text box, type the new password again.
