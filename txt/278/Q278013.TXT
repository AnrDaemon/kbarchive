TITLE   :BUG: ASP Error 80070005 When You Create a Visual Basic Component
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbASP kbCOMt kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSASP kbDSupport kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you instantiate a Visual Basic component from an Active Server Pages (ASP)
page, you may receive the following error:

   Server object error 'ASP 0178 : 80070005'
   Server.CreateObject Access Error

   The call to Server.CreateObject failed while checking permissions. Access is
   denied to this object.

With Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5), you may receive the following error
message:

   Error number: -2147024891

   ASP 0178 Server.CreateObject Access Error
   The call to Server.CreateObject failed while checking permissions.

This error may occur after you install a new Visual Basic component on your Web
server using a Standard Setup Package that was created on a computer with
Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 SP4 or SP5.

CAUSE
=====

The authenticated user for the Visual Basic (VB) run-time file (Msvbvm60.dll)
does not have sufficient permissions. The authenticated user is the
IUSR_computername account when you use anonymous access or the user that is
authenticated with the Web page.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, assign Windows NT File System (NTFS) Read and Execute
file permissions to the Everyone group (or to the appropriate users) for VB run
time (Msvbvm60.dll). VB run time is usually located in the Winnt\System32
folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the Standard Setup Package to update VB run time on the Web server,
the setup application replaces the existing VB run time with the updated version
when you restart your computer. In addition, the setup application replaces the
NTFS file permissions for the Everyone group with the user who installs the new
application. Because a Visual Basic component depends on VB run time, when you
try to create your component, the CreateObject method fails due to insufficient
permissions to VB run time.
