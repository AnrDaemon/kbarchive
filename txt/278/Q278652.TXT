SYMPTOMS
========

Certain games and benchmarking programs that rely heavily on video hardware
vertex buffer callbacks may run more slowly after you install Microsoft DirectX
8.0.

CAUSE
=====

Some advanced 3-D video acceleration techniques that are collectively known as
"Hardware Texture and Light" have been reworked and enhanced for DirectX 8.0.

Because video drivers that are written for earlier versions of Microsoft DirectX
cannot properly leverage these changes, you may notice a reduced video frame
rate or other graphics performance issues in certain games.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact your hardware manufacturer to inquire about how
to obtain a video driver that is compliant with DirectX 8.0.
