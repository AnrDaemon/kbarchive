TITLE   :APPC Print Job with AVM Commands May Print Extra Lines
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::3.0 SP4,4.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbsna300sp4 kbsna400sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP4, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An Advanced Program-to-Program Communication (APPC) print job that contains
Absolute Vertical Move (AVM) commands may print with extra blank lines when you
print through the host print service that is included with SNA Server 3.0
Service Pack 4 (SP4) and 4.0 SP2. This problems occurs only if the print session
in SNA Server is configured to use a Printer Definition Table (PDT) file that
includes a New Line (NL) definition.

CAUSE
=====

The virtual print driver (Winvprt.dll) that is used by the host print service is
not correctly updating the current print line when it processes a NL for a print
session by using a PDT that contains a NL definition. An AVM command that is
issued after a NL causes an incorrect number of Line Feeds (LF) to be issued
because of the incorrect value for the current print line.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 SP4 and SNA
Server 4.0 SP2. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack
3.
