SUMMARY
=======

WordPerfect has confirmed that the following error message may be displayed on a
system running WordPerfect 5.1 with MS-DOS 5.0.

   Internal Stack Overflow
   System Halted

To correct this error, use the BUFFERS= and STACKS= commands in the CONFIG.SYS
file.

This information applies to Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following commands must be added to the CONFIG.SYS file to resolve the above
error message:

      BUFFERS=X

(where X is 16 or more)

      STACKS=16,128

The STACKS command needs to occur AFTER the BUFFERS= statement, and BUFFERS needs
to be set to at least 16. The default number for BUFFERS is 15 for machines with
at least 640K memory.


The STACKS command supports the dynamic use of data stacks to handle hardware
interrupts. The syntax of the command is:

STACKS=n,s

(where n specifies the number of stacks and s specifies the size [in bytes] of
each stack).

The stacks are created within the buffers; therefore, the STACKS command must
occur after the BUFFERS statement.

The product included here is manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
