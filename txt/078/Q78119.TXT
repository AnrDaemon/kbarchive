TITLE   :PRB: Help Compiler Warning "Using Old Key Phrase Table" Cause
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When building a help file, the Help Compiler issues the warning "Using Old Key
Phrase Table."

CAUSE
=====

A key-phrase file (a .PH file) exists at compile time.

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete the key-phrase file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Help Compiler builds a help file and the compression option is
specified, it creates a phrase table file with the .PH extension as part of the
compilation process. Because creating the phrase table is a time- consuming
process, the Help Compiler will issue the "Using Existing Key Phrase Table"
warning and use an existing .PH file (if a .PH file is available) instead of
creating a new one. This technique minimizes the compilation time for
modifications to an existing help file. However, to obtain maximum compression,
a new phrase table must be created.
