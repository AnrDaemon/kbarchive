-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you try to change the buffer size of the MS-DOS 5.0 or later DOSKEY.COM
utility and DOSKEY is currently active, the following error message is
displayed:

   Cannot change BUFSIZE.

If this error is displayed, you must run a new copy of DOSKEY to increase or
decrease buffer size.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DOSKEY.COM, included with MS-DOS 5 or later Upgrade, allows MS-DOS commands to
be recalled and edited. DOSKEY may also be used to create command macros (DOSKEY
macros).

You can change the size of the buffer in which DOSKEY stores commands and DOSKEY
macros with the /BUFSIZE= switch. This switch may only be used when starting the
DOSKEY program. The default buffer size for the DOSKEY utility is 512 bytes, and
the minimum setting for the buffer is 256 bytes.

To start the DOSKEY utility with a buffer size larger or smaller than the
default, use the following command:

   doskey /bufsize=<size>

(Where <size> is the desired DOSKEY buffer size in bytes.)

If a copy of the MS-DOS DOSKEY utility has already been installed, you must
reinstall it to increase the buffer size with the /BUFSIZE= switch.

For example, to reinstall DOSKEY with a buffer size of 1024 bytes, type the
following at the MS-DOS prompt:

   " doskey /reinstall /bufsize=1024 " (without the quotation marks)

Note: When DOSKEY is reinstalled, all DOSKEY macros and the DOSKEY command
history will be erased.
