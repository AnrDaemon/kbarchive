SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.1 of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) contains
several redistributable dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). These DLLs may be
included with an application that runs under Windows version 3.0 to provide some
of the new Windows functionality.

The VER.DLL version-checking DLL is designed to install the distributable DLLs to
a Windows 3.1 or 3.0 application. VER will check to see whether the
redistributable DLLs are already present on the system, and will ensure that an
older copy of a given DLL is not copied over a newer copy.

The installation program for an application that includes one or more of the
version 3.1 Windows SDK DLLs should install them into the Windows system
directory (by default, C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM). The name of this directory can be
determined using the GetSystemDirectory function.
