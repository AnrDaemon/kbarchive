SUMMARY
=======

Procom Technology's SCSI hard and floppy drives (internal and external) require
the device driver from version 2.14 of SCSIDISK.EXE, to work with the MS-DOS 5
and later. To use these drives with MS-DOS 6 or later, you need to obtain the
device driver from version 2.52 of SCSIDISK.EXE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Procom states that all models of their SCSI hard and floppy drives, internal and
external, require version 2.14 or later of SCSIDISK.EXE when used with MS-DOS 5
and version 2.52 or later when used with MS-DOS 6 or later.

SCSIDISK.EXE can be obtained from Procom Technology technical support or from
their bulletin board service (BBS).

MS-DOS 5.0
----------

The file number (name) on the BBS for version 2.14 of SCSIDISK.EXE is
SCSI214.EXE. This is a self-extracting file. To decompress the file after
downloading it, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

   " SCSI214" (without the quotation marks)

The corresponding device driver is called SCSIDISK.SYS, and can be used for all
of Procom's floppy and hard drives. For use with MS-DOS 5, the SCSIDISK.SYS
driver should be dated 7/14/91 or later, with a size of 10143 bytes and a time
stamp of 2:14.

MS-DOS 6.0
----------

To use Procom's SCSI drivers with MS-DOS 6, Procomm recommends that you obtain
version 2.52 of SCSIDISK.EXE. This version is also available on Procomm's BBS.
