SUMMARY
=======

When troubleshooting on a computer with a third-party memory manager, you must
minimize the variables by temporarily removing the memory manager. Occasionally,
it is also necessary to substitute other memory managers to determine the cause
of the problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To troubleshoot the memory manager problem, do the following:

1. Remove everything from the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files except the
   following:

   CONFIG.SYS
   ----------

   files=
   buffers=
   shell=

   AUTOEXEC.BAT
   ------------

   path
   prompt $p$g

   third party memory managers
   third party disk partitioners
   statements needed to run application that is being tested

2. Remove the third party memory manager. If some sort of memory manager is
   necessary to produce the problem, replace it with a Microsoft memory manager.

3. If using the Microsoft memory manager solves the problem, either

    - Use Microsoft's memory manager.

   -or-

    - Call the third party memory manager manufacturer for assistance.

If the above steps do not solve the problem, continue to troubleshoot with the
Microsoft memory manager. Sometimes a combination of steps will solve the
problem.
