SUMMARY
=======

American Megatrends Incorporated (AMI) has confirmed that when EMM386.EXE is
used on a computer with an AMI BIOS, the upper memory ranges E000-EFFF and
F000-F3FF can be included with the i= parameter.

This available upper memory can be used for loading terminate-and-stay- resident
programs (TSRs), device drivers, or for setting a LIM 3.2 expanded memory page
frame (at E000).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The E000-EFFF range gives EMM386.EXE control of an additional 64K of upper
memory, and the F000-F3FF gives control of an additional 16K of upper memory.

The DEVICE statement in the CONFIG.SYS file should be modified to include this
range as follows (without providing LIM 3.2 expanded memory support):

   device=c:\dos\emm386.exe i=E000-EFFF i=F000-F3FF noems

To provide expanded memory support, the following example may be used:

   device=c:\dos\emm386.exe I=F000-F3FF ram M9

The AMI product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
