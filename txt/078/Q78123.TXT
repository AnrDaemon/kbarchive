-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When attempting to execute a print screen of a graphics image to a
Hewlett-Packard (HP) PaintJet color printer, the printout will always appear in
black and white.

The GRAPHICS.COM and GRAPHICS.PRO files provided with the MS-DOS 5 or later
Upgrade do not provide support for color printing on HP PaintJet printers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The GRAPHICS utility is a TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) program that must be
installed before executing a print screen. There are several options you can use
when invoking the GRAPHICS utility, which are described on pages 505-508 of the
version 5.0 "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."

Along with the GRAPHICS.COM utility, there is a GRAPHICS.PRO file that contains
printer information for 16 printer types. When using one of these printers, the
printer type can be specified when installing GRAPHICS.COM.

Example
-------

   GRAPHICS PaintJet [drive]:\[path]\GRAPHICS.PRO

(Where [drive] and [path] are the location of the graphics files.)

Graphics profiles are text files that contain a list of supported printers and
the commands for each video mode of the printers listed.

In the MS-DOS 5.0 GRAPHICS.PRO file, the section definition for the PaintJet
explicitly states:

   The profile treats the PaintJet as a black and white device for both text and
   color. Specifying one color plane uses just black and white as the two
   available colors.

The product included here is manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
