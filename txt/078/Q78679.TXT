SUMMARY
=======

WordPerfect Office versions 3.0 and 3.01 include terminate-and-stay- resident
programs (TSRs) that run in graphics mode. These programs may not execute
properly within MS-DOS Shell if Shell is also operated in graphics mode.

To avoid this problem, run Shell in text mode by using the /T switch, as
follows:

   dosshell /t

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Windows 3.0 and other programs that use graphic screen drawings may
also prevent WordPerfect Office TSR programs from functioning properly.

The WordPerfect utilities include CL.EXE, a calendar utility, and NOTIFY.EXE, a
notification utility.

The WordPerfect products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
