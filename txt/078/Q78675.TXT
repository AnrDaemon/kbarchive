======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Setup detects a Disk Manager or SpeedStor partition, MS-DOS 5 Upgrade
version 5.0a Setup automatically updates the necessary driver(s). This is a
change from the original MS-DOS 5 Upgrade Setup program, which in this case,
instructs the customer to expand the driver(s) manually.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a Disk Manager or SpeedStor partition is detected, Setup checks for the
location of the driver in the CONFIG.SYS file. If the correct DEVICE command is
found in the CONFIG.SYS file, and the date of the file currently being loaded is
earlier than the driver being distributed with MS-DOS 5.0a, Setup will give you
the option to automatically upgrade the driver or to install MS-DOS 5.0 to
floppies.

Setup will refer you to the README.TXT file for instructions on how to manually
install the driver if one of the following conditions exist:

 - There is no CONFIG.SYS file

 - Setup cannot find the DEVICE command in the CONFIG.SYS file

 - The driver does not exist on the hard drive

If you choose to automatically install the driver, Setup will upgrade the driver
before creating the Uninstall disk. The original driver will be renamed to
*.OLD, and the new driver will be copied to the location pointed by the DEVICE
command in the CONFIG.SYS file. If the partition detected is a Disk Manager
partition, the XBIOS.OVL file will be copied to the root directory after the
original XBIOS.OVL file has been renamed to XBIOS.OLD.

SpeedStor often uses the same partition type as several varieties of UNIX. Setup
assumes any partition using this type is used by SpeedStor. If you have a UNIX
partition and are NOT using SpeedStor or one of its drivers (HARDRIVE.SYS or
SSTOR.SYS), do an unconditional setup (using Setup /U).
