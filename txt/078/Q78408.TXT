The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Phillips has confirmed that after installing MS-DOS 5.0 on a Magnavox 300 or 500
series computer with Phillips BIOS, erratic behavior may occur. This behavior
will appear as random error messages at boot-up, or an inability to format
disks.

To resolve this problem, ensure that the CMOS settings match the devices
installed on the computer. If they match, save the settings; otherwise, make
appropriate changes and save the settings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some of the error messages that may occur at boot-up when MS-DOS 5.0 is
installed on the above machines are:

   Bad or Missing Command Interpreter

   Bad or Missing SHARE.EXE

   Error in CONFIG.SYS line 4 4

To check CMOS settings, do the following:

1. Press CTRL+ALT+INSERT when the machine is booting.

2. Verify the current settings (type of drive and so on).

3. Press F3 to save the settings.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
