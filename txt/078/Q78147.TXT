SUMMARY
=======

When trying to run a non-Windows application from Microsoft Windows, you may get
the error message "Packed File Corrupt." If this happens, you should execute the
file LOADFIX.COM before starting a program from Microsoft Windows 3.0 or 3.1.
You can start LOADFIX.COM from the PIF Editor, followed by the desired program
as follows:

   Program Filename:     LOADFIX.COM
   Optional Parameters:  C:\MYDIR\MYPROG.EXE
   Start-up Directory:   C:\MYDIR

MORE INFORMATION
================

LOADFIX.COM, a utility provided with MS-DOS 5.0, addresses a problem with files
that were compressed with the EXEPACK utility or the /EXEPACK linker option used
in some Microsoft products. LOADFIX.COM prevents an error message that is a
result of either the EXEPACK utility or the /EXEPACK linker, and is needed
before the DOS application can be started.

For more information concerning the MS-DOS implementation of LOADFIX.COM, query

   Packed and File and Corrupt and MS-DOS and LOADFIX.COM
