SUMMARY
=======

Some ROM BIOS video controllers do not fully support the PC standard
specification for the number of lines in the display. When ANSI.SYS loads, it
checks the PC standard location 40:84H to determine the number of rows active on
the display. On displays that don't support this standard, garbage values may be
at 40:84H. When this happens, ANSI.SYS will use this number to set the display,
resulting in a distorted display.

If you are experiencing a distorted display with ANSI.SYS (or other programs),
load ANSI.SYS with the /S switch. This switch causes ANSI.SYS to ignore the
value at 40:84H and use 25 for the number of rows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Loading ANSI.SYS with the /S switch can be used to remedy other programs that
experience similar problems with the non-standard display.
