SUMMARY
=======

Palasam, a computer aided design (CAD) software package manufactured by Advanced
Micro Devices (AMD), requires version 1.2 of the SP.EXE file for proper
operation with Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 and later.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The current version of Palasam, version 1.2, is not shipping the updated SP.EXE
file. To determine if the SP.EXE file is compatible with MS-DOS, verify the file
date and size. The updated SP.EXE file required has a date of 08/01/91 and is
43,957 bytes in size.

The updated file can be obtained from the AMD bulletin board. The file to
download is SP.ZIP. SP.ZIP is in a compressed form and must be expanded with
PKUNZIP, which is also located on AMD's bulletin board. After unzipping SP.ZIP,
the SP.EXE must be placed in the EXE subdirectory.

PKUNZIP is available on many bulletin boards.

The product included here is manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft. We
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
