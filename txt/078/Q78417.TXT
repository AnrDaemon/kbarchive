The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can move the .HLP Help files in Multimedia Windows to a different directory
by either creating or editing the WINHELP.INI file.

NOTE: You cannot relocate help files in the original Windows 3.0 nor 3.0a
product.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To relocate a Help file:

1. Open the the WINHELP.INI file in a text editor such as Notepad and look for
   the [Files] section.

2. On a new line, place the name of the file to be relocated.

3. Enter an equal sign and then the path for the new location.

For example, to relocate the Calculator Help file to a directory called WHELP on
network drive X:, add the following line to the [Files] section of the
WINHELP.INI file:

   calc.hlp=X:\WHELP

If a WINHELP.INI file does not yet exist, one needs to be created in the
following form:

      [Files]
      calc.hlp=X:WHELP
