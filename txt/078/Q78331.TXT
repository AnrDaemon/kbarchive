-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While running Microsoft Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode, 486 Micronics ISA
motherboards using the Micronics ASIC chipset and Phoenix 486 ROM BIOS Plus (all
revisions) may drop to MS-DOS or stop responding (lock up or hang) up when
accessing floppy drives.

NOTE: This problem does not occur in later versions of Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

Setting the CPU speed in the CMOS to FAST, instead of SLOW, eliminates these
problems. This BIOS switch allows you to select a CPU front panel switch to
enable or disable the TURBO mode. With the BIOS set to FAST, you cannot select
the TURBO mode from the CPU front panel. It is locked in FAST.

You can access the CMOS setup as follows:

1. Press CTRL+ALT+ESC.

2. Press the DOWN ARROW key to move to CPU Speed.

3. Use the RIGHT ARROW and LEFT ARROW keys to toggle speed mode to FAST.

4. Press ESC to exit and save changes, the system will then reboot.
