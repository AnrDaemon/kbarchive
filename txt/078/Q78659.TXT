MORE INFORMATION
================

Sytos tape operating system version 3.11 was discontinued in 1990, and has not
been thoroughly tested with MS-DOS 5.0. If MS-DOS is not loaded in the high
memory area (HMA), Sytos may work. In the event Sytos is not compatible with
MS-DOS 5.0, Sytron recommends upgrading to Sytos Plus version 1.21 or later.

Sytos Plus File Backup Manager versions 1.21 and later have been tested with
MS-DOS 5.0 by Sytron, and Sytron has confirmed these versions are compatible
with MS-DOS 5.0. The current version (as of November 7, 1991) of Sytos Plus File
Backup Manager is version 1.31.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
