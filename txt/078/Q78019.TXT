SUMMARY
=======

The Setup program for Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1991 will terminate with a
"fatal error copying FONTFILE.FON", or similar error message (where FONTFILE.FON
is the actual name of one of the Bookshelf fonts) if there is not enough disk
space for these fonts on the drive where Windows is located.

For example, if Bookshelf is going to be set up in the C:\VIEWER> directory,
Windows is located in the D:\MWINDOWS> directory, AND the drive D doesn't
have at least 593664 bytes available, Setup will terminate with the above error
message. To ensure that Setup doesn't terminate prematurely, make sure that
there is at least 1 MB of disk space available on the drive that contains
Windows.
