SUMMARY
=======

AST Research has confirmed that AST Research Premium 286 computers with Premium
BIOS versions earlier than 2.0 may experience system hangs or inconsistent
keyboard behavior while running Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 and later.

AST Premium BIOS version 2.0 is also required to operate Microsoft Windows 3.0 in
enhanced mode if the FAST BOARD 80386 upgrade is used.

AST Premium 286 machines using the FAST BOARD 80386 upgrade require AST BIOS
version 2.0 or later to operate in Windows 3.0 enhanced mode. Machines using the
earlier Phoenix BIOS are not able to run Windows in enhanced mode.

AST Research recommends replacing the Premium BIOS with an updated version.
