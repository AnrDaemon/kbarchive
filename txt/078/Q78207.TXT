SUMMARY
=======

Finale 2.0 from Coda Music Software does not use the MIDI (musical instrument
digital interface) capabilities in Windows enhanced mode; however, in real and
standard modes, MIDI functions correctly.

Likewise, there is no implementation of Multimedia Windows' MCI (media control
interface) within Finale 2.0. This applies to all modes of Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The lack of MIDI functionality with Finale 2.0 in Windows enhanced mode is a
result of a design decision made by Coda Music Software. Because no standard for
multitasking MIDI applications has previously been set, Coda Music Software did
not implement multitasking abilities for Windows enhanced mode to use.

Multimedia Windows' MCI sets a new standard for multitasking MIDI applications.
Finale 2.0 was released before the Multimedia Windows specification was
completed, and does not use MCI.


Finale is manufactured by Coda Music Software, a vendor independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance
or reliability.
