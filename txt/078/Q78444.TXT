The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

According to TLB Solomon, when using Solomon III Accounting Software version 5.0
or 6.0 with MS-DOS 5.0 or later, the following error message may be displayed:

   Incompatible COMMAND.COM found in COMSPEC

This error can be corrected by editing the SOLOMON.BAT file that comes with the
software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Solomon III versions 6.0 and earlier are launched by the SOLOMON.BAT file. For
proper operation with MS-DOS 5.0, two lines must be deleted from the SOLOMON.BAT
file located in the \ACCT\PROG subdirectory.

To modify the SOLOMON.BAT file, do the following:

1. Back up the SOLOMON.BAT file.

2. Using MS-DOS Editor or another text editor, delete the following lines from
   the SOLOMON.BAT file:

   Compvers
   IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO END

3. Save the file and run SOLOMON.BAT.

Solomon III versions 7.0 or later use a SOLOMON.INI file that replaces the
SOLOMON.BAT file from earlier versions.

TLB Solomon recommends using Solomon III Accounting Software version 7.1 with
MS-DOS 5.0.

   Solomon III and 7.0 and MS-DOS 5.0 SOLOMON.INI
