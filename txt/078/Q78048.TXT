SUMMARY
=======

Macros recorded with the Microsoft Windows Recorder program are more reliable
when created using keystrokes, than macros created using equivalent mouse
operations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Macros based on mouse operations are dependent upon the locations and sizes of
objects on the desktop. The sizes and location of objects tend to change for
each Windows session and user. Therefore using these as reference points may
result in Recorder macro errors, such as the following:

   Playback window does not exist

Keystroke-based macros do not depend on the locations or sizes of objects; thus,
they are not sensitive to changes in these reference points.

Example of Keystroke Macro
--------------------------

1. Execute the Recorder program.

2. Minimize Program Manager.

3. From the Recorder menu, choose Macro Record.

4. Begin recording the macro, using the following settings:

         Playback (Group Box)

         To:                 Same Application
         Speed:              Fast
         Record Mouse:       Everything
         Relative to:        Screen

5. While holding down the ALT key, press the TAB key repeatedly until Program
   Manager is highlighted. Release both ALT and TAB to restore Program Manager.

6. Press ALT+F, R to choose Run from Program Manager's File menu.

7. Type

   clock.exe

   and press ENTER to run the Clock program.

8. Type CTRL+BREAK to stop recording.

9. Save the macro.

Steps 1-4 must be performed because the Program Manager may be minimized at the
start of the macro. If so, it will not respond to the File Run command given in
step 5. These steps ensure the Program Manager is open.
