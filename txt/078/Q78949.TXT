SUMMARY
=======

The Toshiba HARDRAM battery back-up RAM causes the following system error when a
permanent swap file has been set up on the RAM drive

   Unable To Read From Drive:x

where x is the assignment for the HARDRAM drive.

The following line must be added to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

   VirtualHDIrq=off

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Toshiba HARDRAM is a battery-backed-up, RAM-based RAM drive. The battery
backup allows information stored in the HARDRAM chips to be retained when the
computer is rebooted or turned off.

The VirtualHDIrq=<Boolean> switch allows Windows in 386 enhanced mode to
terminate interrupts from the hard disk controller, bypassing the ROM routine
that handles these interrupts. Some hard drives might require that this setting
be disabled for interrupts to be processed correctly. If this setting is
disabled, the ROM routine handles the interrupts.
