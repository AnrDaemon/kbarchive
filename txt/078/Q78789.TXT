======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive a printing error message when you try to print from a Windows
application under Windows 3.0 or 3.0a. For example, you may receive the
following error message in the Write:

   Could not print page - Error:-1.

This problem does not occur with later versions of Windows.

CAUSE
=====

This may be caused by the file DOSSHELL.SWP being in the directory pointed to by
the SET TEMP= setting in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The DOSSHELL.SWP file is created
in this directory if the following statements are both true:

 - DOSSHELL has been executed and then shelled out by pressing SHIFT+F9.

 - Multiple instances of the DOSSHELL program have been entered and are running.

RESOLUTION
==========

If multiple instances of DOSSHELL are started while Windows is running, use the
following procedure to close the multiple instances of DOSSHELL to remove the
DOSSHELL.SWP file from the temporary directory:

1. Close Windows.

2. At the command prompt, type

   exit

   to go into the DOSSHELL program.

3. Close the DOSSHELL by pressing ALT+F to open the File menu, and press X to
   exit.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above until you do not go into the DOSSHELL program when
   you type:

   exit

This should remove the DOSSHELL.SWP file from the temporary directory.

NOTE: If the computer has been turned off while the DOSSHELL.SWP file was in the
temporary directory, the above procedure may not remove the file.

The DOSSHELL.SWP file is created with a read-only attribute. The file can not be
deleted until you clear the read-only attribute. The following command can be
used to clear the read-only attribute of the file so that it can be deleted:

   Attrib -r dosshell.swp
