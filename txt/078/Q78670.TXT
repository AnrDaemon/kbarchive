TITLE   :Startup Directory Option Ignored in MS-DOS Shell
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.x,6.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In MS-DOS 5.0 and Shell, it is possible for the startup directory option to be
ignored when a program item is started from the Active Task List.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The startup directory option will be ignored in the following two situations:

 - The program item being started from the Active Task List was originally
   placed there as a result of a LOAD=ENABLED entry in the DOSSHELL.INI file.

 - The program item being started from the Active Task List was added to the
   Active Task List by holding down the SHIFT key, and double-clicking on the
   program item (or pressing SHIFT+ENTER).

In the above cases, the effective startup directory will be the active directory
at the time Shell was started.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this limitation, write a batch file for the application that
first changes to the desired startup directory before starting. Then create a
program item for the batch file, not the executable. (Note: In this case, the
startup directory option is now unnecessary.)

Example
-------

To make a batch file to run Microsoft Word for MS-DOS, do the following:

1. Include the following lines in a batch file called WORD5.BAT:

      cd \word5
      word

2. Make a program item for WORD5.BAT using the procedure described on pages
   186-188 of the version 5.0 "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."
