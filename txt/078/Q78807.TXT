DDEMETA is a server application that uses the Dynamic Data Exchange Management
Library (DDEML).

To use DDEMETA, perform the following five steps:

1. Start DDEMETA.

2. Choose DDE Init from the Sample menu to register DDEMETA with the DDEML.

3. Start a DDE client application to initiate a conversation with DDEMETA. In
   the client, use the application name "DDEMETA" and the topic "Test".

4. After the conversation is established, the client application can request any
   "item" of type CF_METAFILEPICT from the server.

5. When DDEMETA receives the request, it will read the TEST.WMF file from the
   disk and pass it to the client application.

To test DDEMETA, request a CF_TEXT item. Note that the "item" reference is never
checked; therefore, any item name works.

Note: This program will not read "placeable" metafiles. For more information on
"placeable" metafiles, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
