The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The second parameter on the BUFFERS line represents the secondary cache. It
basically performs a pre-read of sectors, and therefore provides better disk
performance. This functionality was introduced in MS-DOS 4.0, and it works the
same way in later versions of MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an application starts reading from disk, it is likely that the application
will continue reading more sectors from the same area. If MS-DOS pre-reads
beyond the read issued into the buffers, when the user asks for them, they are
already in the buffers. This improves disk performance considerably, especially
during file loads.

The syntax for the BUFFERS command is:

   buffers=n[,m]

The "m" can have a value between 1 and 8.

If a second value ("m") is specified, it activates the operation of the secondary
cache, and "m" sectors are pre-read. If the second parameter is not specified,
the secondary cache is not activated.

If you specify to buffers values, extra buffers are then allocated during MS-DOS
initialization for the secondary cache. As a result, MS-DOS takes up more memory
since the secondary cache is present.

NOTE: Under MS-DOS 5.0 and later, the secondary cache is not loaded into the high
memory area (HMA) even if MS-DOS is loaded high; the secondary cache is always
allocated in conventional memory.
