SUMMARY
=======

Emerson has confirmed that the Emerson Promouse M290 requires driver version
6.01b to be compatible with MS-DOS Shell.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Attempting to use earlier versions of the Emerson Promouse drivers with Shell
may result in an invisible mouse pointer, a distorted mouse pointer, a frozen
mouse pointer, or erratic pointer movement. The names of the Emerson Promouse
drivers are EMMOUSE.COM and EMMOUSE.SYS.

Emerson also has another mouse called the Emouse. At this time, Emerson does not
have an mouse driver for the Emerson Emouse M250 that works with Shell.

To obtain Emerson Promouse M290 driver version 6.01b, call Emerson.
