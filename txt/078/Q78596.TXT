SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the two reasons why MS-DOS Shell requires recent mouse
driver versions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first reason that Shell requires a recent mouse driver is that some older
versions have bugs that may cause unexpected behavior when used in graphics
modes or on certain types of monitors. Some examples of this behavior include:

 - Mouse "smear" on the screen

 - Inability to move the cursor more than half way across the screen

 - Occasional crashes

The second reason Shell requires a recent mouse driver is that Task Swapper
relies on certain functions of the mouse driver that are not present in older
versions. These functions were added to the mouse driver to support Task Swapper
and Windows (among other reasons). If this functionality is not supported, task
swapping can cause the mouse to act unexpectedly and possibly crash the machine.
