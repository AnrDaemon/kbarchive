Page 339 of the "Microsoft Window User's Guide" states that when using
the kermit protocol and eight data bits, parity can be specified as
even, odd, or none.

By definition, parity is the eighth bit. If eight data bits are specified,
parity cannot be specified (odd, even, mark or space). This is the
definition and is supported in the serial chip (Intel 8250).

Terminal simply supports the available communications protocols, which are
unrelated to the download protocol chosen (Xmodem, Kermit, ASCII, and so
on).
