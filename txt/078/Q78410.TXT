TITLE   :System Hangs with dBase III 1.0 or III+ 1.0

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Borland/Ashton-Tate has confirmed that dBase III version 1.0 and dBase III+
version 1.0 may cause your system to stop responding (hang) if HIMEM.SYS is
installed.

CAUSE
=====

dBase III 1.0 and III+ 1.0 include a feature called SuperLock that conflicts
with HIMEM.SYS. According to Borland/Ashton-Tate, SuperLock is a copy-protection
feature that allows you to install dBase III 1.0 and III+ 1.0 only once to a
hard drive.

WORKAROUND
==========

Adding the /CPUCLOCK:ON switch to the HIMEM.SYS line in your CONFIG.SYS file may
resolve this conflict. If you are using dBase III or III+, add the following
line to your CONFIG.SYS file

      device=[drive]:\[dir]\himem.sys /cpuclock:on

where "[drive]" and "[dir]" indicate the location of the HIMEM.SYS driver.

The /CPUCLOCK:ON switch slows HIMEM.SYS, allowing it to wait longer for signals.
This affects the speed of HIMEM.SYS, but not the system clock speed. Early
versions of dBase were written for slower machines.
