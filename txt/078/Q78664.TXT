The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


If you are upgrading to Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 and using Windows 3.0 with a Novell
network, you must use IPX.COM version 3.02a and NET5.COM version 3.1. Using
Windows 3.0 without the updated files may produce a variety of problems with
printing, enhanced mode operation, network operation, and Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To generate IPX.COM version 3.02a, do the following:

1. Expand and rename the IPX.OB_ and NET5.CO_ files from the MS-DOS 5.0 disks
   (disk 6 [5.25-inch set] or disk 3 [3.5-inch set]) to the appropriate
   directory, as follows:

      expand ipx.ob_ c:\ipx.obj
      expand net5.co_ c:\net5.com

2. If the customer owns NetWare DOS/Windows Workstation update (shell kit), go
   to step 4.

3. Copy the new IPX.OBJ file to the Novell disk labeled:

      SHGEN-1 (NetWare 286)

   -or-

      WSGEN (NetWare 386)

4. Copy the new IPX.OBJ to the Novell Windows workstation update disk labeled:

      NetWare   DOS/Windows WORKSTATION

5. Use the SHGEN (NetWare 286) or WSGEN (NetWare 386) program on this disk to
   generate a new IPX.COM file. For more information about creating an IPX.COM
   file or using the NET5.COM file, see the Novell documentation.

6. Restart the Novell network using the updated IPX.COM and NET5.COM files.

Novell NetWare and NetWare DOS/Windows Workstation are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
