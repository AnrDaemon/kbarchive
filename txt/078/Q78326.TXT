SUMMARY
=======

Support for real mode has been removed from Windows 3.1. Many applications
designed for Windows 3.0 do not support real mode. The reasons behind this trend
toward protected mode include superior memory management and smaller, faster
application code.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The remainder of this article lists the advantages and disadvantages of removing
support for real mode from applications.

Advantages of Removing Real Mode Support
----------------------------------------

1. Protected mode code is smaller, cleaner, and more maintainable. These factors
   lead to a faster, more responsive, more reliable, system. Code is smaller and
   cleaner for the following reasons:

   a. The 286 and higher processors can track memory locations in hardware,
      which makes locking and unlocking memory objects unnecessary. An object
      can be locked once when it is allocated and unlocked just prior to being
      freed. Because the object can move in memory even when it is locked, it is
      not necessary to bracket each access to an object with lock and unlock
      calls.

   b. Far functions can use simplified function prolog and epilog code. For more
      information on this aspect of protected mode, query on the following
      words:

   " prod(winsdk) and protected and streamlined " (without the quotation marks)

   c. Because protected mode code is restricted to running on 286 and higher
      processors, the Microsoft C Compiler -G2 switch can be used to generate
      smaller and faster application code.

2. Protected mode (both standard and enhanced mode) breaks the "640K barrier."
   Furthermore, under enhanced mode, Windows uses paged virtual memory to expand
   available memory by using the system hard disk as a swapping device. The
   large address space allows applications to have more code and data and allows
   users to run more applications.

3. Testing is easier because there are fewer Windows modes to test. To fully
   test a product that runs under real mode, five separate modes must be tested.
   Real mode itself contributes three of those modes: real mode with no expanded
   memory, real mode using the small-frame Expanded Memory Specification (EMS)
   and real mode using the large- frame EMS. The other two modes are standard
   mode and enhanced mode. Because support for real mode has been eliminated,
   the same amount of testing effort can concentrate on producing a better
   product. It also provides an opportunity to develop and test additional
   enhancements. For more information on EMS, query on the following words:

   " prod(winsdk) and ems and developers " (without the quotation marks)

4. Based on a survey of Windows developers, most developers are targeting only
   protected mode because Windows performance on 8086- based and 8088-based
   machines is not satisfactory. Furthermore, these machines cannot address more
   than 640K of RAM.

5. "Wild writes," write-accesses to memory that incorrectly modify a memory
   location, can frequently be detected in protected mode through the mechanism
   of a GP-fault (an unrecoverable application error). It is not possible to
   detect these errors under real mode. These GP-faults provide information
   about application bugs before the application is released.

For the reasons mentioned above, Microsoft is removing support for real mode from
Windows 3.1. For these same reasons, many developers have also removed support
for real mode from applications developed for Windows 3.0. Applications that are
written to support only protected mode should be marked with the Resource
Compiler's -T switch to prevent the application from loading in real mode.

Removing support for real mode also benefits the end user because applications
run faster and are more reliable. While small applications run quickly in real
mode, larger applications run slowly. However, in protected mode, large
applications also run quickly. A collection of large and small applications can
be run simultaneously without any loss in speed. For example, when more
applications are running simultaneously than can fit in the physical memory
installed in the system, the paging mechanism (only available in enhanced mode)
intelligently manages virtual memory to keep the most-frequently used memory
pages in physical memory. This management speeds up the system.

Disadvantages of Removing Real Mode Support
-------------------------------------------

1. The installed base of 8088-based and 8086-based machines cannot use the
   software.

2. Code that performs segment arithmetic cannot be used in protected mode.
   Therefore, some drivers and MS-DOS programs that run in real mode must be
   rewritten for protected mode, or they cannot be run under Windows 3.1.
