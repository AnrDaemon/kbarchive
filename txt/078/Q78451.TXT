SUMMARY
=======

EGA.sys is a driver that facilitates the use of the shadow registers in EGA and
more advanced video cards. Through the use of the mouse driver's Interrogate
Driver function, it is possible to determine if EGA.sys is installed.

The interface to the Interrogate Driver function is as follows:

      AH = FAh
      BX = 0
      INT 10h

The return values are:

      AX = Restored
      BX = 0 if the mouse driver or EGA.SYS is not installed

      < 2 if EGA.SYS was installed with the mouse driver
      >= 2 if EGA.SYS was installed

For more information, see chapter 10 of the "Microsoft Mouse Programmer's
Reference," second edition (Microsoft Press).
