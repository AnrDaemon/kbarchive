SUMMARY
=======

The SETVER.EXE device driver included with Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade contains a
table of default entries. This article contains a list of the default entries
for SETVER.EXE.

If SETVER.EXE is used to reference a device driver, SETVER must be entered before
the specified device driver in the CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a device driver is loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file and is referenced in the
SETVER table, that device driver must be loaded after SETVER.EXE in CONFIG.SYS.

The following is an example of loading the device driver SSTDRIVE.SYS in
CONFIG.SYS after SETVER.EXE:

   device=c:\dos\setver.exe
   device=c:\sstdrive.sys
