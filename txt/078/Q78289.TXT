TITLE   :LOADHIGH Command with Non MS-DOS Command Interpreter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.x,6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error messages may be displayed if you use the LOADHIGH command
with a third-party command interpreter:

   Unknown or Unrecognized Command Loadhigh

   -or-

   Unknown or Unrecognized Command LH

The above errors occur if you invoke the LOADHIGH or LH command from the command
prompt or from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file with a command interpreter other than
COMMAND.COM.

CAUSE
=====

The internal MS-DOS LOADHIGH (LH) command may not be recognized if you are using
a command interpreter other than COMMAND.COM. For example, releases earlier than
4.0 of the JP Software command interpreter 4DOS do not correctly recognize the
LOADHIGH command. If this is the case, the SHELL statement in CONFIG.SYS might
read as follows

   shell=[drive]:\[dir]\[filename.ext] [drive]:\[dir]\ /p

(where [drive] and [dir] are the drive and directory location of the command
interpreter, and FILENAME.EXT is the name of the command interpreter).

RESOLUTION
==========

If the SHELL statement refers to a filename other than COMMAND.COM, replace it
with the MS-DOS 5.0 or later COMMAND.COM (and its correct drive and path). Save
the file and reboot the computer. You can now use the LOADHIGH (LH) command from
the MS-DOS command prompt or from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
