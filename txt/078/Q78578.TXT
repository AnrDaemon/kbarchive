SUMMARY
=======

DRIVER.SYS helps to allocate a new drive letter for an existing floppy drive
(which is recognized by MS-DOS) and to redefine the physical parameters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, suppose drive A is a 1.2 MB floppy drive. Using DRIVER.SYS, the
drive can be assigned as drive D as a 360K drive.

So, in this example, if the command FORMAT A: is executed, the floppy in the
drive will be formatted to a 1.2 MB disk. If FORMAT D: is executed, the floppy
in the same drive will be formatted to 360 K.

DRIVER.SYS can be used with any floppy drive that MS-DOS has already recognized.
DRIVER.SYS cannot be used to create a drive letter for a drive that MS-DOS has
not recognized.

For example, if a third party device driver is used to provide support for a
fourth floppy drive, DRIVER.SYS cannot be used to redefine the physical
characteristics of the third party driver.
