-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If MS-DOS Editor is deleted from the MS-DOS Shell Main program list, it may be
restored using Shell to recreate the Editor program item.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To add the Editor back to the Main program list, do the following:

1. Press TAB to select the Main area of the Shell screen. If the Shell screen
   doesn't show the area titled "Main," you may change the display by pressing
   ALT+V to select the View Menu. From the View menu, choose Program/File Lists,
   and press ENTER.

2. From the File menu, choose New, and press ENTER.

3. In the New Program Object dialog box, select the Program Item option and
   choose OK.

4. In the Program Title text box of the Add Program dialog box, enter "Editor"
   (without the quotation marks). In the Commands text box, enter "Edit %1"
   (without the quotation marks) and choose OK.

5. Another Program Item Properties dialog box will be displayed. In the Window
   Title text box, enter "File to Edit" (without the quotation marks). In the
   Program Information text box, enter "Enter the name of the file to edit"
   (without the quotation marks). In the Prompt Message text box, enter "File to
   Edit" (without the quotation marks). Choose OK.

6. The Editor should now appear as a program item within the Main section of the
   screen.

If you are using MS-DOS 5.0 or 5.0a you can also add the Editor to the Main
program list by using the EXPAND utility to replace the DOSSHELL.INI file. If
you are using MS-DOS 6.0, expand the appropriate file for your video card and
monitor. For example, type "EXPAND A:\EGA.IN_ C:\DOS\DOSSHELL.INI" (without the
quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER. Any changes
made to the DOSSHELL.INI file since installation will be lost.
