TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Print Object from an Embedded Window in Viewer
PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Software Development Kits
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Multimedia Viewer, when attempting to print a 256-color image
from an embedded window, only the text around the embedded window prints.

CAUSE
=====

Multimedia Viewer version 1.0 does not support printing the content of an
embedded window. The code to support displaying a 256-color image in an embedded
window is provided by a dynamic-link library (DLL), which is independent of
Viewer.

RESOLUTION
==========

One method to work around this lack of support is to copy the undithered image
to the Windows Clipboard using the CopyBmp macro. Then use a bitmap editor to
print the image. (For more information about the CopyBmp macro, see page 7-8 of
the "Microsoft Multimedia Development Kit Multimedia Viewer Developer's
Guide.")

It is also possible to create a DLL to print the embedded window image. The DLL
could be triggered as a hot spot (similar to the CopyBmp macro). For more
information, see the sample DLLs provided with the Microsoft Multimedia
Development Kit (MDK) in the VIEWER directory. Writing a DLL that interfaces
with Viewer is discussed in chapters 14 and 15 of the "Multimedia Viewer
Developer's Guide."
