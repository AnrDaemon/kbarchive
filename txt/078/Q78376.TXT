SUMMARY
=======

The Paradise 8514/A Combo card requires an EMMEXCLUDE statement to properly work
with Microsoft Windows enhanced mode. This card uses our 8514/A driver.

In Windows 3.0 and 3.0a, this exclude must be done in the SYSTEM.INI's [386Enh]
section. In Windows 3.1 or 3.11, you should exclude with EMM386.EXE if you are
using it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Paradise 8514/A Combo card has four dip switches on the back of the card
that allow you to configure the card. The first dip switch allows you to control
the range of upper memory blocks (UMB) used by the card.

On the back of the card are the following switches:

   Switch 1 =      Extended Video ROM
   Switch 2 =      Monitor Type
   Switch 3 =      Monitor Type
   Switch 4 =      Syncing

If Switch 1 is in the ON position, then the card is using the area from
A000-C9FF. If you are using Windows 3.0, the following line needs to be added to
the SYSTEM.INI's [386Enh] section:

   EMMExclude=A000-C9FF

If Switch 1 is in the OFF position, then the card is using the area from
A000-D9FF. If you are using Windows 3.0, the following line needs to be added to
the SYSTEM.INI's [386Enh] section:

   EMMExclude=A000-D9FF

This Western Digital/Paradise card is configured as an 8514/A card with VGA
hardware included on it. This is an 8- or 16-bit card that comes with 512K VRAM
expandable to 1024K VRAM.
