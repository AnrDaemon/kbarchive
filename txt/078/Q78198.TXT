======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Qualitas Inc. Move'Em is a program loader designed to load device drivers and
memory resident programs into the upper memory area (UMA). Qualitas states that
Move'Em is fully compatible with MS-DOS versions 3.0 and later.

Move 'Em is not a memory manager. This utility can backfill conventional memory
with existing expanded memory, but does not manage (or provide) extended or XMS
memory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Move'Em facilitates the moving of device drivers, network system drivers, and
memory resident programs out of the first 640K of conventional memory. These
drivers and programs are moved into the upper memory blocks (UMB) in the memory
range from 640K to 1 MB. Move'Em provides a resident program optimization
utility for automatically determining the most efficient loading order.

In systems with less than 640K system memory, Move'Em backfills the conventional
memory with expanded memory to provide a full 640K of usable system memory. This
feature requires an EMS 4.0 compatible memory board or specific chip sets. This
feature does not support XMS memory management.

System Requirements:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS or IBM PC-DOS version 3.0 or later

 - Either an 80286 or 80386 based IBM PC compatible computer with a NEAT, LEAP,
   or AT\386 CHIPSet from Chips & Technologies with at least 1 MB of memory

-or-

 - An IBM PC compatible computer with a fully hardware compatible EMS 4.0 board
   with at least 256K of expanded memory
