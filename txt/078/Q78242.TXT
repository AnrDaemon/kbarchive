The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows Help Compiler version 3.1 no longer supports the "side-by- side"
paragraph format provided by Microsoft Word for MS-DOS and Microsoft Word for
the Macintosh. This format was used in files compiled by version 3.0 of the
Windows Help Compiler to create multiple columns of information.

To create multiple columns in a file compiled with version 3.1 of the Help
Compiler, use the Table feature provided by Microsoft Word for Windows.

Help files that are authored using side-by-side paragraphs and compiled using
version 3.0 of the Help Compiler will continue to be supported using version 3.1
of Windows Help (the help file viewer).

Additional query words: 3.00 no32bit 3.10
