SUMMARY
=======

When an Award BIOS revision earlier than 3.22 is installed on a VTI Turbo 55
computer, the following problems may appear after upgrading to MS-DOS 5.0 or
later:

 - Difficulty reading and writing to the hard drive

 - Machine not bootable with IDE drive

 - Random POST (power on self test) error codes at boot-up (that is, 1701, 1702)

The VTI Turbo 55 computer requires Award BIOS revision 3.22 or later to correctly
run MS-DOS version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The VTI Turbo 55 is an 80286 based computer that originally shipped with Award
Modular BIOS revision 3.03. This version of the BIOS does not support IDE
drives, and may produce the above problems with MS-DOS 5.0 or later. This
particular machine was manufactured by Samsung for the Philips Corporation, and
also was issued under the model designation SAMSUNG S550.

Philips and Award concur on the necessity of the BIOS upgrade for full
functionality.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
