SUMMARY
=======

While running Microsoft Windows on a Novell Network, you cannot attach to a
print server by typing the full name of the file server. You must select the
file server with your mouse or type the first letter of the file server name and
then use the arrow keys to choose the correct server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Example
-------

Let's assume you have three servers: James, Jane, Noid.

When you perform step 4 above and type "J" (without the quotation marks), it
would display

   James
   Jane
   Noid

and "James" would be selected. If you continue and type the name "Jane" (rather
than just "J"), the display will change when you type the character "n". It will
then change to the server "Noid".

This behavior occurs because the attach function only looks at the first letter
of the server and ignores the other letters.
