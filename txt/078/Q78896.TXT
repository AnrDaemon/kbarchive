TITLE   :SysEdit Does Not Save Read-Only Configuration Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SysEdit configuration utility included with Windows 3.0 and 3.0a allows you
to edit and save the AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, WIN.INI, and SYSTEM.INI files
with the MS-DOS archive file attribute even if the files are marked with the
read-only file attribute prior to running SysEdit.

CAUSE
=====

When you edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, WIN.INI, and SYSTEM.INI files,
SysEdit creates a backup of the original files and assigns an .SYD extension to
each. The .SYD files inherit the read-only attribute from the original files
read from the hard disk, but do not transfer the file attribute to the modified
AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, WIN.INI, and SYSTEM.INI files that are saved when
exiting SysEdit.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a.
This problem was corrected and does not occur in later versions of Windows.

Additional query words: 3.0 3.0a
