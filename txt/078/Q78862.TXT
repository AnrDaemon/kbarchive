TITLE   :FIX: Incorrect Code Generated If Operand Is [eax][eax]
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0, incorrect code is generated
for instructions, such as the following, using the operand [eax][eax]:

   lea edi, [eax][eax]
   mov edi, [eax][eax]

RESOLUTION
==========

A workaround for this problem is to embed the opcode for the instruction
directly in the code. The sample code below demonstrates this method.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A listing file from the following program will show that the instruction lea
edi, [eax][eax] is encoded as 8D 3C 3A. However, the code actually placed into
the executable is 8D 3C. The correct code in the case of lea edi, [eax][eax] is
8D 3C 00. Note that the operand [eax][eax] is available only when using the .386
or .486 directives.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assembler options needed: none

   .386
   .MODEL small

   CODE32 SEGMENT DWORD PUBLIC USE32 'CODE'
   ASSUME CS:CODE32
   main PROC
       lea edi, [eax][eax] ; Replace this by BYTE 8Dh, 3Ch, 00h
                           ; since the code generated by it is
                           ; 8D 3C 3A, which is incorrect.
       mov edi, [eax][eax] ; Replace this by BYTE 8Bh, 3Ch, 00h
                           ; since the code generated by it is
                           ; 8B 3C 3A, which is incorrect.
       ret
   main ENDP
   CODE32 ENDS

   END main
