======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you select the Olivetti/AT&T Monochrome or PVC Display in Windows Setup
(from the Options menu choose Change System Settings) and you load the Microsoft
Mouse driver version 7.04, Microsoft Windows version 3.0 does not run in
standard mode on a Toshiba T1200XE laptop computer.

This problem occurs in Microsoft Windows version 3.0 and 3.0a. It does not occur
in later versions of Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

To use standard mode while the version 7.04 driver is being used, select either
the CGA or COMPAQ Portable Plasma display depending on the resolution required.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Toshiba T1200XE accepts several different screen choices, including CGA
COMPAQ Portable Plasma, and Olivetti/AT&T Monochrome or PVC Display. All of
these choices work with real mode while the Microsoft Mouse driver version 7.04
is loaded.

The COMPAQ Portable Plasma display choice is recommended by Toshiba and gives the
best resolution. For more information, contact Toshiba technical support.
