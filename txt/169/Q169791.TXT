SYMPTOMS
========

A query may result with truncated values in an expression columns.

CAUSE
=====

The expression column is basing its width on the first record value of the
source table.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the expression to use an IIF() function that returns a value of necessary
width. This forces FoxPro to create a column wide enough to hold the results of
the expression column. NOTE: The example code uses the table created at the
bottom of this article in the MORE INFORMATION section. Here's an example:

      SELECT *, IIF(ISNULL(fld2),SPACE(15),TTOC(fld2,1)) AS test ;
      FROM temp WHERE fld2 is NOT NULL

-or-

Change the source table's order so that the first record's value in the source
table is wide enough to hold the expression columns output. An index order
cannot be used here, since FoxPro opens the source table in another workarea.
Using an additional query can do this. Here's an example:

      SELECT * FROM temp ORDER BY fld2 DESCEND INTO CURSOR temp2
      SELECT *, TTOC(fld2,1) AS test FROM temp2

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Execute the following five lines to create and populate a table:

         CREATE TABLE temp (fld1 C(3), fld2 T NULL, fld3 C(3))
         INSERT INTO temp (fld1, fld2, fld3) VALUES ('aaa',NULL,'aaa')
         INSERT INTO temp (fld1, fld2, fld3) VALUES ('bbb',datetime(),'bbb')
         INSERT INTO temp (fld1, fld2, fld3) VALUES ('ccc',NULL,'ccc')
         INSERT INTO temp (fld1, fld2, fld3) VALUES ('ddd',datetime(),'ddd')

2. Execute the following lines from the Command window:

         SELECT *, TTOC(fld2,1) AS test FROM temp
         SELECT *, TTOC(fld2,1) AS test FROM temp WHERE fld2 IS NOT NULL

Note that the test column comes up improperly sized for both queries. The test
column is based solely on the width of the source table's first record, a 1 byte
NULL character. Thus, the column shows only a 1 from the result of the TTOC()
function.

This occurs even when records that contain NULL are not included in the result
set, per the second query.
