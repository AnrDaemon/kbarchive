 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

There is a small time window in Afd.sys (the Microsoft Winsock2 service provider
for TDI transport) where it does not indicate data received immediately after a
connection is accepted. This window should affect only applications that use
AcceptEx with buffer space for receiving data after a connection is accepted.

In TCP/IP, timewait state queue management has a problem that causes time wait
states to exceed four minutes under stress.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
