TITLE   :Cannot See All FPNW Files from Windows 95 Explorer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0,95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view a directory of files from a Windows 95 client (with Microsoft
Client for NetWare Networks or Novell's 32-bit Client for Windows 95 loaded) to
a Windows NT Server 4.0 File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) volume or
directory, not all of the files may be displayed using Windows Explorer, a
command prompt, or Network Neighborhood. The shortened names for all the files
appear if you view them with WINFILE from Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

This problem seems to be related to the way Windows 95 parses the files when
retrieving a directory listing on the FPNW server. The Windows 95 client may or
may not be able to view all of the files in a given FPNW directory, depending on
the naming convention used by any client saving files to the FPNW server.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the directory where the Windows 95 client cannot display or view all of the
files, create a file named 00000000.000 with READ-ONLY and HIDDEN attributes.

The Windows 95 client should then be able to view all of the files when
retrieving a directory list. In some cases, if using the 00000000.000 file does
not work, you can correct this problem by creating, in the directory where the
problem is occurring, a file named !!!!!!!!.!!! with READ-ONLY and HIDDEN
attributes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem only occurs with Windows 95 clients connecting to an FPNW server.
Other NetWare clients (CSNW, NetX, and VLM clients) can view all files correctly
when connecting to the FPNW server.
