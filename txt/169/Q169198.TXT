SUMMARY
=======

This article describes some tips for controlling public folders in a Microsoft
Exchange organization.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Design a public folder scheme for your organization. Decide how public
   folders will be used in your organization to organize data and how to
   facilitate easy access to the data in the public folders. For example, you
   may have public folders organized by geographical locations (North America,
   Europe, and so on), or by business units (Finance, Marketing, Development),
   or any other manner that works in your organization.

2. Once the fundamental public folder design is in place, create the top level
   public folders.

3. Control which users can create top level public folders. This allows the
   Microsoft Exchange administrator to control the basic structure of how
   information in the public folders is organized. The administrator can control
   which users can create top level public folders by using the Exchange
   Administrator program.

   Under the Site object, select Configuration and then get properties of the
   Information Store Site Configuration object. Go to the Top Level Folder
   Creation page.

4. The Exchange administrator can also control how the public folder hierarchy
   is displayed to individual users by setting the Client Permissions on the
   individual folders. Each public folder has a property called Folder Visible.
   If this permission is not granted to a user, then that user cannot view that
   public folder in the public folder hierarchy. For example, if all public
   folders under a folder called Finance should not be accessible to any users
   other than upper level managers, the default permissions on that public
   folder can be set with the Folder Visible permission revoked. The individual
   users or Distribution Lists of users who need access to the folders can then
   be granted rights to be able to view the Finance folder.

5. Create replicas of public folders on different servers depending on how many
   users will need to access the public folders and the types of network links.
   For example, if a public folder is accessed by all users in your
   organization, it may be useful to add replicas of this folder to other
   servers and other sites. If the network links are sufficient, adding public
   folder affinity may also be an alternative to replicating folders.
