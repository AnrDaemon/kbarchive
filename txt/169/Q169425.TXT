TITLE   :XADM: Missing X.400 Organization Field
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you create an X.400 Site Connection in the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program, the X.400 Organization field may be missing. This can
lead to message routing problems when multiple X.400 connectors are deployed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by having an Address Type specified in the Exchange Site
Addressing object that does not have an associated proxy address generator. This
is most commonly seen when removing a third party gateway and not removing the
associated address type. When you create the X.400 Site Connector, you click on
Connected Sites on the X.400 properties page. From here, you specify the
sitename of the other Site and click OK. Normally, the X.400 address will be
created as follows:

   C=US;A= ;P=Exchange Org;O=Exchange Sitename

However, if there is a bad address type specified under Site Addressing and Site
Addressing, the following format will be used:

   C=US;A= ;P=Exchange Org;

The Sitename will not be propogated to the Organization field.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is to go open the X.400 Connector properties page, click
Connected Sites, click Routing Address, and add the Organization name. Then
Re-run the un-install software that came with the gateway to properly remove all
of the leftover components.
