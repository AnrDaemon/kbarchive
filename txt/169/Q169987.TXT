SYMPTOMS
========

When your computer is idle for a period of time and then stops responding
(hangs), the Close Program dialog box may report that Msgsrv32 is not
responding.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when power management is enabled, and you have issues
with programs not responding correctly to power management commands, for
example, screen saver programs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use the following steps:

1. Quit any running programs, and then test to determine if a specific program
   is causing this behavior. If you quit all running programs and the issue is
   resolved, one of the programs that was running is the cause of this behavior.
   If this does not resolve the issue, continue to step 2.

   NOTE: This issue is often caused by screen saver programs.

2. Disable power management. To do so, click Start, point to Settings, click
   Control Panel, and then double-click Power.

3. In the Power Management box, click Off (or click the "Allow windows to manage
   power on this computer" check box to clear it).

4. Click OK.

5. Restart your computer.

If the behavior continues to occur, follow these additional steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click System.

2. On the Device Manager tab, double-click the System Devices branch to expand
   it.

3. Double-click Advanced Power Management Support.

4. On the Settings tab, click the Enable Power Management Support check box to
   clear it, and then click OK.

5. Click OK.

6. Restart your computer when you are prompted to do so.
