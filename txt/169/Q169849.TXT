TITLE   :XWEB: MAPI Clients Message Status Not Automatically Updating
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you run a Microsoft Outlook Web Access Client and read a message, Outlook or
Microsoft Exchange Client will not show the message as read until that client
reads a message.

CAUSE
=====

Exchange Client only updates the read/unread status of messages when it makes a
change to a message. As a result, if a message is read by a Web client, it will
continue to show up as unread in Outlook or Exchange Client until that client
makes a change (reads a message). This behavior is by product design.
