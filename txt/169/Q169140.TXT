SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to
lease IP addresses for routers configured to use secondary IP addressing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some routers can be configured with primary and secondary addresses that allows
one port on a router to listen to multiple (logical) subnets.

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 and later introduced Superscoping support for DHCP.
This allows a DHCP server with one network interface card to assign leases for
multiple logical subnets.

To setup Superscopes in DHCP Manager, perform the following steps:

1. Create a new scope in DHCP Manager that corresponds with the primary subnet
   on the router.

2. Create the Superscopes that will be a part of the secondary address(es)
   configured on the router.

3. Use the DHCP Manager to define the Superscope to include all the subnets.

For complete steps on how to setup DHCP Superscoping, please refer to the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
