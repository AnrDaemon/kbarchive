PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using SNMP to monitor sysuptime (system up time), the counter will be reset
after 49.7 days or 4294967295 milliseconds.

CAUSE
=====

MIB_II.MIB (RFC 1213) specifies sysUpTime as TimeTicks. SMI.MIB (RFC 1155)
defines TimeTicks as having a max value for 4294967295. This is the number of
milliseconds that this counter can hold. This also corresponds to about 50 days,
this is why the counter resets back to 0.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
