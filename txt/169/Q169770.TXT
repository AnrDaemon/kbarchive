IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

You can move the Tracking.log directory from one drive to another, for example,
<Drive>:\Exchsrvr\Tracking.log to <Newdrive>:\Exchsrvr\Tracking.log.
Moving the tracking logs to another drive may be required for backup purposes
and for access by other applications.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To move the Tracking.log directory, perform the following steps:

1. In Control Panel Services, stop the Exchange System Attendant service.

2. Copy the <drive>:\Exchsrvr\Tracking.log directory to another drive.

3. Change the following registry setting to point to the new location that in
   step #2:

   Hkey_local_machine\system\current control set\services\MS
   ExchangeSA\Parameters\Log Directory

   = <Newdrive>:\Exchsrvr\Tracking.log

4. Restart the System Attendant service.

5. Remove the Tracking.log share currently on the Exchange Server and re-share
   the new Exchsrvr\Tracking.log directory with the name:

   tracking.log

   If you receive an error when deleting the share, check to see if another
   Administrator is currently trying to track messages on the Exchange Server.
