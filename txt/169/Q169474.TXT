TITLE   :SMS: PCM Does Not Consider Windows 95 Daylight Savings Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a "run command on workstation" job to a Windows 95 client, it will
execute one hour later than the "offer after" date if the Windows 95 client is
observing daylight savings time and the Windows NT Server site server is not.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 does not change the actual time of the computer, only the displayed
time in the user interface when the daylight savings time option is enabled.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, configure both the Windows NT Server site server and the
Windows 95 computer to observe daylight savings time. Do change the setting, use
the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Date/Time icon.

3. Click the Time Zone tab.

4. Click to select the "Automatically adjust clock for daylight saving changes"
   check box and then click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
