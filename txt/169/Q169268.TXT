TITLE   :FTP Err Msg: Error: Connection Timed Out
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to a site via FTP, you may get the following error
message after a few minutes if the Internet Information Server (IIS) is
configured with more than one default gateway:

   Error: Connection timed out

This may also happen only when you try to connect via FTP using a slow link (for
example, a 28.8k modem connection) to a server that has more than one default
gateway.

CAUSE
=====

The IIS computer should have only one IP default gateway. The IP address of the
default gateway should be configured on the external network adapter card only.

This requirement is a result of the basic architecture of TCP/IP. Only one
default gateway must be defined on a host that resides on two or more
non-connected networks.

If IIS server is configured with more than one network interface, it is connected
to two networks that are by design non-connected.

A default gateway is a router that is supposed to be used for all traffic that
has no specific route. If you have two default-gateways, the IIS server TCP/IP
stack will assume that they lead to the same set of networks. This will cause
the IIS server to send Internet traffic to the internal network, or internal
traffic to the Internet.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the default gateway from the advanced TCP/IP settings of the internal
network interface on the IIS server and define static routes to the internal
network segments.

For additional information, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

   Q161380 : Only One Default Gateway Allowed On Proxy Server

Because no default gateway will be defined for the internal network, you must add
static routes using the Route Add command. These routes can be made persistent
by using the -p command switch.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information on adding static routes to the routing table, please
see the following:

 - Type route /? for additional command switches.
