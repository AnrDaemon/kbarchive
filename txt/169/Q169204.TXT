TITLE   :Renegotiate CNOS After Connection Reestablishment
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP2,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP2, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

CNOS (change number of sessions) is a general data stream (GDS) variable that is
used to negotiate the number of sessions that can be used between an LU-LU pair.
This takes place during connection startup after the SNA Server service has
started. If the connection is stopped (without stopping the SNA Server service),
and then restarted, CNOS is not renegotiated.

NOTE: There are other cases where CNOS is renegotiated. These are outlined in the
"Registry Entries Only Used on an SNA Server" section of the "SNA Server
Reference Guide."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11 Service
Pack 2 (SP2) and 3.0 SP1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, Snaservr.exe renegotiates CNOS after a connection is
stopped and restarted without ever bringing down the SNA Server service. In
addition, after you apply the fix, you need to edit the registry as described
below.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe, as appropriate for your
   version of Windows NT).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

      HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\ 
      SNAServer\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry:

   "Value Name: RenegCNOSAtReconnect
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   Value: YES" (without the quotation marks)

4. Exit Registry Editor.
