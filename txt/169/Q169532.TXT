TITLE   :WD97: Paragraph Borders Displayed Erratically with Objects
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your document contains floating objects, paragraph borders or shading may not
be displayed or printed the way you expect.

Depending on the amount of text in the paragraph and where the floating object is
placed, paragraph borders or shading may not be displayed or printed to the
right of the object. For example, if a line of text in the paragraph fails to
extend to the right of the object, a border (or shading) will not be displayed
or printed to the right of the object for that line.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

 - The floating object has a wrapping style applied to it.

   -and-

 - The floating object is placed over a paragraph that is formatted with borders
   or shading.

WORKAROUND
==========

To display the border correctly, use the following steps:

1. Place the insertion point at the end of the line of text that does not extend
   past the floating object.

2. Press the TAB key until the insertion point moves to the right of the object.
   (The insertion point may not move to the right of the object if the object is
   close to the right margin or indent.)

NOTE: Converting the object to a framed object will not correct the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
