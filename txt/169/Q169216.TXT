TITLE   :Using Winscl.exe to Remove Corrupted WINS Entries by Version ID
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Winsdmp.exe and Winscl.exe Resource Kit utilities to remove
corrupt entries from the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) database.

This article explains how to use Winsdmp.exe to determine the version ID of the
corrupt entries and how to use Winscl.exe to remove those entries.

In certain cases (such as when names contain extended characters or spaces) it is
necessary to remove entries based on their version ID, rather than name (using
the DN option). The DN option fails when you attempt to remove these entries
with extended characters or spaces. Also, the DN option only removes single
entries, and does not remove ranges of entries.

NOTE: The WINS Server must be running when you use Winscl.exe to modify the WINS
database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Run Winsdmp.exe to dump the WINS database.

   Example:

   WINSDMP 130.0.10.1 > Winsdata.txt

   The following is an example line that information that WINSDMP provides:

   130.10.10.10,"TEST           ",0,17,3,0,0,502,0,820870950,1,130.0.25.14

   The following table lists each item in the example above on the left side and
   the corresponding explanation for the example item on the right side:

      Example Item        Explanation for Example Item
      ------------        ----------------------------
      130.10.10.10        The IP address of the owner of the entry
      "TEST"              The NetBIOS name of the entry
      0                   The 16th character of the NetBIOS name
      17                  The number of characters in the name
                          (15 for NetBIOS name + 2 for ID)
      3                   Type of Record
      0                   State of Record
      0                   Version ID (High order)
      502                 Version ID (Low order)
      0                   Static Flag
      820870950           Time Stamp
      1                   Number of records in entry
      130.0.25.14         IP Addresses assigned to entry

   The possible Record Type values are defined as:

      UNIQUE        = 0
      NORMAL GROUP  = 1
      SPECIAL GROUP = 2
      MULTIHOMED    = 3

   The possible Record State values are defined as:

      ACTIVE    = 0
      RELEASED  = 1
      TOMBSTONE = 2

2. Use the data from the dump to compile a list of entries (or a range of
   entries) to be removed from the WINS database. Then use the Winscl.exe
   utility to delete the individual entry or the range of entries.

If you want to remove a range of consecutive entries, enter the minimum and
maximum versions when prompted by WINSCL. If you want to remove multiple
non-consecutive entries, they must be processed individually.

The example below uses low order bit of the version ID (which is 502 in the
earlier example) and the high order bit (which is 0 in the earlier example) to
remove a single WINS entry.

Example: (with annotations in <<< >>>)

Winscl.exe
TCP/IP or named pipe. Enter 1 for TCP/IP - 1 <<<enter 1
here>>>
Address of Nameserver to contact--130.0.10.1 <<<this is the IP address
of the WINS server>>>
RN-Register a name
QN-Query a name
DN-Delete a name
GV-Get the current vers. counter value
GM-Get the Owner Id to Max. Vers. No. mappings
GMO-Get the Owner Id to Max. Vers. No. mappings (3.5 WINS)
GST-Get WINS statistics
GSTO-Get WINS statistics (3.5 WINS)
PUSHT-Send a push trigger to another WINS
PULLT-Send a pull trigger to another WINS
SI-Statically initialize the WINS
CC-Initiate consistency check on the WINS - HIGH OVERHEAD OPERATION
SC-Initiate scavenging on the WINS
DRR-Delete all or a range of records
PRR-Pull all or a range of records from another WINS
GRBN-Get records by name
GRBV-Get Records by version numbers
BK-Backup the database
RS-Restore the db
RSO-Restore the db (created by a pre-SUR WINS)
RC-Reset WINS counters
CR-Count the number of recs. in the db
GI-Get Info about WINS
SDB-Search the db
GD-Get domain names
DW-Delete WINS records and info.
CW-Connect Wins
WA-Get Add of current Wins
ME-SHOW MENU
NOME-DONT SHOW MENU
EX-Terminate winscl
Command - DRR <<<this command deletes a record or range of
records>>>
Address of Owner Wins -- 130.10.10.10 <<<this is the IP address of the
WINS server which owns the entry>>>
Min. Vers. No (<high part> <low part> -- 0 502 <<<this is
the minimum version ID>>>
Max. Vers. No (<high part> <low part> -- 0 502 <<<this is
the maximum version ID. In this case, since the min. and max. are the same, only
one registration will be deleted>>>
Status returned is (SUCCESS - 0)

NOTE: If the Maximum Version Number is different than the Minimum Version Number
it will delete the full range. The version number can also be obtained from the
WINS Manager in the Show Database window under version ID column. The version ID
shown in this window is in HEX. It needs to be converted to decimal to use with
Winscl.exe. For example, if the version ID is 201 for the record that needs to
be deleted, the Minimum version number becomes 0 513 when used with WINSCL.
