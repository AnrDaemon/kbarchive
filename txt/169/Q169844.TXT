TITLE   :Removing an IP Routing Protocol from Routing and Remote Access
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

An Internet Protocol (IP) routing protocol such as Routing Information Protocol
(RIP) or OSPF cannot be completely removed from Routing and Remote Access
Service using the Graphical User Interface Routing and Remote Access Service
Administrator (Mpradmin.exe). However, Routing and Remote Access Service
Administrator can be used to disable the protocol. To completely remove the
interface, the command-line interface Routemon.exe must be used. Both options
are discussed below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Disabling a Protocol Using the Graphical User Interface Mpradmin.exe
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To effectively disable a routing protocol, you remove all interfaces from it. If
this is done, the routing protocol is still installed but does not function. To
remove interfaces from a routing protocol, click the routing protocol in the
left pane of the Routing and Remote Access Service Admin. window. Then
right-click the interface in the right pane of the window, and click Remove
Interface.

Removing a Protocol Using the Command-Line Interface Routmon.exe
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you prefer to entirely remove the routing protocol from Routing and RAS Admin,
you can use the following command:

   ROUTEMON IP DELETE PROTOCOL PROTO= { RIP | OSPF | BOOTP }

For example, if you wanted to remove OSPF, the command would be:

   ROUTEMON IP DELETE PROTOCOL PROTO= OSPF

When you enter the command, there must be a space between PROTO= and the routing
protocol you choose to remove. After removing the protocol using the
command-line interface, the graphical interface will not reflect the change
until Mpradmin.exe is closed and restarted.
