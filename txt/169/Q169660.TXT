TITLE   :XCLN: Excel Hyperlinks Don't Work If .xls Is in Public Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If a Microsoft Excel worksheet contains a hyperlink to a cell on another
worksheet in the same workbook, and the workbook is posted to a Microsoft
Exchange public folder, the hyperlink will not work. When you click the
hyperlink, you receive the following error message:

   An unexpected error has occurred (HRESULT= 0004005)

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Excel has no physical reference for the location of the hyperlink (for
example, c:\Mydocs\Test.xls) when it is stored in a public folder. A Microsoft
Excel 97 hyperlink needs a physical disk and file location as a reference to
work correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
