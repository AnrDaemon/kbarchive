TITLE   :WD97: MS Excel Text Formatting May Not Convert Properly to Word
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Word 97 to open a Microsoft Excel 97 worksheet with
multiple character formats within a cell (for example some text is bolded and
other text is italic), all text in that cell uses the format of the first
character. All other formatting is lost.

NOTE: This problem also occurs when you use the File command on the Insert menu
in Word to insert a Microsoft Excel 97 worksheet.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, copy the worksheet in Microsoft Excel 97, and then
paste it into Word. This method preserves all character formatting.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Earlier versions of Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel convert rich text formats
accurately. The problem is due to changes in the Microsoft Excel binary
interchange file format (BIFF) definitions.
