TITLE   :PPT: EPS Graphic with Clipping Path Not Supported
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:4.0; WINDOWS:4.0,4.0a,4.0c,7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbdta

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you import an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file into Microsoft PowerPoint
4.0 for the Macintosh, the graphic appears transparent. If you save the file and
then open it in PowerPoint for Windows, the graphic no longer appears
transparent.

CAUSE
=====

You may experience this problem when the EPS image is saved with a clipping path
from a photo editing program, such as Adobe Photoshop. PowerPoint does not
directly support clipping paths. When you import an EPS image that contains a
clipping path into PowerPoint for the Macintosh, you see a PICT preview of the
graphic. The way this PICT preview is displayed is dependent on the Macintosh
operating system.

When you open the presentation in PowerPoint for Windows, PowerPoint translates
the PICT graphics primitives (commands) into the closest equivalent Windows
graphics device interface (GDI) primitives.

Clipping paths are converted, but they become invisible and no longer mask the
image.

For additional information about clipping paths, please see the "More
Information" section later in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some Macintosh-based photo editing programs, such as Adobe Photoshop, can save a
clipping path when you export images as EPS files. A clipping path is a vector
description of the edges of a specified element within an image, and it can be
used to mask or make part of your image transparent.

Photoshop is manufactured by Adobe Systems, Inc., a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
