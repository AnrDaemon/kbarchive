SUMMARY

If you experience any problems with the FrontPage Server Extensions for the
Microsoft Internet Information Server that are related to incorrect NTFS
permissions you can fix them by clicking the Check button in the FrontPage
Server Administrator. To access the Server Administrator, run the Fpsrvwin.exe
file located in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft FrontPage\bin folder, by
default.

NOTE: There is no shortcut for the Server Administrator on the Windows Start
menu.
