PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbdta word97

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a drag and drop operation to create a hyperlink in a Word 97
document that already contains a hyperlink, the new hyperlink may be nested
inside the existing hyperlink.

NOTE: This behavior occurs when you use a drag and drop operation and you create
a hyperlink to another file, such as a Microsoft Excel 97 file, or another
hyperlink within the same document.

CAUSE
=====

The insertion point was inside an existing hyperlink field when you clicked
Create Hyperlink Here on the shortcut menu that appeared when you completed the
drag and drop operation.

WORKAROUND
==========

Move the insertion point so that it is not positioned inside an existing
hyperlink field before you create the new hyperlink.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Both hyperlinks will work correctly whether or not they are nested. However,
when one hyperlink is nested inside another, it is difficult to determine which
hyperlink to click.

For more information about hyperlinks, click the Office Assistant, type
"hyperlink" (without the quotation marks), click Search, and then click "create
hyperlinks."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Word Help is not installed on your computer, please see the
