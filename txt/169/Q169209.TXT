SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the IntelliPoint 2.0 software for the Microsoft IntelliMouse,
some options are not available in the mouse configuration tool. Also, if you
enable the Turn On Wheel option on the Wheel tab, you receive the following
error message:

   IntelliPoint is unable to change your settings.

   Close any open applications, save any open documents, restart Windows, and
   then try to change your IntelliPoint settings again.

   If you still have difficulty changing your settings, run IntelliPoint Setup to
   reinstall the files, and then start IntelliPoint again.

CAUSE
=====

The IntelliPoint version of the mouse driver is not started.

RESOLUTION
==========

The IntelliPoint software includes replacements for the following device
drivers: I8042, Busmou, Inport, and Sermou. The IntelliPoint versions are
MSi8042, MSbumou, MSinport, and MSsermou.

To enable the IntelliPoint version of the mouse driver, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Devices.

2. Click the driver that is currently being used for your mouse and set the
   Startup option to Disabled. For example, if you are using a serial mouse,
   locate the Sermou driver and set the Startup option to Disabled.

3. Click the IntelliPoint version of the driver and set the Startup option to
   System.

4. Restart the computer.
