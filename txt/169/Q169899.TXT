TITLE   :XGEN: Event Log Displays Different Error Description
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In order to correctly interpret the messages in Windows NT Server Event Logs,
make sure that the logs are viewed on a computer running the same version of
Microsoft Exchange Server as the computer that created the logs. Viewing the
logs on a computer that has a different version of Microsoft Exchange Server
installed on it can result in confusion in interpreting the log's messages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Event logs will display different description messages depending on the version
of Microsoft Exchange Server that is installed on the computer. The Event ID
will remain the same. For example, an event log entry from a computer with
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 installed on it will state:

   Event ID: 8
   Description: MSExchangeIS ((479)) Redoing log file
   D:\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\edb.log

The same event viewed on a computer with Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0
installed in it will state:

   Event ID: 8
   Description: MSExchangeIS ((479)) size mismatch on logfile
   D:\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\edb.log. IO size %4 expected while returned size is %5
