=======

This article describes how to create hyperlinks to files inside and outside of a
Web, using the FILE and FTP protocols.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the FILE protocol to link to a file within a Web
------------------------------------------------------

1. Import the file you want to link to into your Web.

2. In FrontPage Editor, select the text or graphic that you want to use as the
   hyperlink source.

3. On the Edit menu, click Hyperlink.

4. Click the World Wide Web tab.

5. In the URL box, type the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the file you want
   to link to. (In FrontPage 1.1, click File in the Hyperlink Type drop-down
   list.)

6. Click OK.

Using the FILE protocol to link to a file outside of a Web
----------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: To prevent security violations, Microsoft recommends that you only use this
procedure on an Intranet. If you need additional help in performing the steps
below, please see your network administrator or server documentation.

1. Place the files you want to link to in a share on a server.

2. Set up the shared server so that everyone has at least read-only access.

3. In FrontPage Editor, select the text or graphic that you want to use as the
   hyperlink source.

4. On the Edit menu, click Hyperlink.

5. Click the World Wide Web tab.

6. In the Hyperlink Type drop-down list, click File.

7. In the URL box, type the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the file you want
   to link to. The path you designate will actually be in the form of a
   Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path, such as the following:

   file://\\ServerName\ShareName\Filename.zip

   The file extension is required.

8. Click OK.

Using the FTP protocol to link to a file on a FTP server
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Place the files you want to link to in a directory on the FTP server.

2. Set up the shared server so that everyone has at least read-only access.

3. In FrontPage Editor, select the text or graphic that you want to use as the
   hyperlink source.

4. On the Edit menu, click Hyperlink.

5. Click the World Wide Web tab.

6. In the Hyperlink Type drop-down list, click FTP.

7. In the URL box, type the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the file you want
   to link to. For example:

   ftp://FTPServerName/Directory/filename.zip

   The file extension is required.

8. Click OK.

Using the FTP protocol to link to a file inside of a Web
--------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Microsoft does not recommend having both HTTP and FTP access to a Web
managed with FrontPage. Also, this requires an FTP server running alongside a
WWW server and mapping directories on top of each other.

Linking to files within the Web via FTP
---------------------------------------

1. Import the file you want to link to into your Web.

2. In FrontPage Editor, select the text or graphic that you want to use as the
   hyperlink source.

3. On the Edit menu, click Hyperlink.

4. Click the World Wide Web tab.

5. In the Hyperlink Type drop-down list, click FTP.

6. In the URL box, type the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the file you want
   to link to. For example:

   FTP://ServerName/Directory/filename.zip

   The file extension is required.

7. Click OK.
