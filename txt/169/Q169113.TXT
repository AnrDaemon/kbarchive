TITLE   :XCON: Using X.400 Connector with TCP/IP in Cluster Environment
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange X.400 Connector between two Microsoft
Exchange Servers and at least one of the servers is a Microsoft Cluster node,
message flow will not occur if you just list the IP address on the Stack tab of
the properties page of the X.400 connector in the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program.

CAUSE
=====

When the Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) attempts to send a
message over the X.400 Connector using just an IP address, it will ask the
Windows NT Server for the local IP address using the INADDR_ANY flag. Windows NT
will return the local IP address of the active node and not the Cluster's
virtual IP address which is configured in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program. The following event will be recorded in the Windows NT Event Viewer
Application Log when this problem occurs:

   Event 9301   MSExchangeMTA     Configuration
   The message transfer gateway that uses the network address
   4E434F5354455354 and the transport stack
   /o=Microsoft/ou=sitename/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers
   /cn=servername/cn=TCP (mtaname) could not be found. Check the
   configuration of the mail gateway. [BASE IL TCP/IP DRVR 36 218] (10)

WORKAROUND
==========

To solve this problem, open the properties page of the X.400 Connector in the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program and click the Stack tab. Change the
stack to use Remote Host Name and change the field to the name of the other
Microsoft Exchange Server. This will need to be done on both servers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
