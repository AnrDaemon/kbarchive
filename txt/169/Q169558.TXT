TITLE   :SMS Database Manager Ignores Named Pipe Definition
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsmsUtil smsutil

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When SQL Server is configured to listen on a named pipe other than its default,
the Systems Management Server Database Manager (DBCLEAN) will not be able to
establish a connection, even when the named pipe definition in the registry is
updated on the Systems Management Server site server. You may encounter this
problem if two versions of SQL Server are installed on the server. (This is a
supported configuration under SQL Server.)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
