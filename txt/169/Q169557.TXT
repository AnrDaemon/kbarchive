SYMPTOMS
========

An active chat session between a computer running the Systems Management Server
Administrator program and a Systems Management Server client may be unexpectedly
closed. This problem may occur if the administrator is typing a message and the
client is simultaneously performing a drag and drop operation on a window, icon,
and so on. This behavior affects Windows 95 and 16-bit Windows clients, but does
not occur on Windows NT clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
