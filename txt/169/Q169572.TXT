SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use Talk It! to produce speech using a Creative Labs sound
card, no sound is heard.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you are using a Creative Labs Sound Blaster 32 or Sound
Blaster AWE 64 sound card and you have fully installed the Sound Blaster support
software. In some cases, the Sound Blaster software replaces the Microsoft ADPCM
CODEC with the Creative ADPCM CODEC.

The Microsoft ADPCM CODEC is required for playing back speech in Talk It! The
Creative ADPCM CODEC does not allow speech playback in Talk It!


RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following steps to disable the Creative ADPCM CODEC and then verify that
the Microsoft ADPCM CODEC is enabled:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Multimedia.

3. On the Advanced tab, click the plus sign (+) to the left of Audio Compression
   Codecs to expand the branch.

4. Locate the Creative ADPCM CODEC.

   Note: If this codec is present, please continue to Step 5. If this codec is
   not present; this article does not apply to your problem. For more
   information about possible solutions to this problem, please refer to the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
