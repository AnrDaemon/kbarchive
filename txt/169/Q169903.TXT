PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run SNA Server 3.0 on Windows NT Server 4.0, an SNA Server Print
Service session fails to start and remains in a pending status.

From Sprtint.atf:

   Calling EnumFontFamilies for Courier New
   Leave, hFont=00000000
   Leave, fGood=0
   ERROR FontSwitch, rc=0x0
   Leave, return_pointer=0x0, rc=1
   SNAP-3270   S3PPPCTL  FAILED TO START JOB
   Enter, id=0x16BFF0
   Enter, id=0x16BFF0
   Leave, pPrt=0016BFF0
   Terminate job 16C004 on printer 16BFF0

CAUSE
=====

The EnumFontFamilies call occasionally returns no fonts when it should return
some, causing the print session to fail to start. This problem occurs when SNA
Server Print Service uses EnumFontFamilies() instead of EnumFontFamiliesEx() on
a Windows NT Server 4.0 computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 Service
Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the new version of enumfontfamilies(), called
EnumFontFamiliesEx(), is used.
