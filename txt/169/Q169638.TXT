TITLE   :XADM: Exchange Uses Information Store for Intersite Replication
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to remove the Private Information Store from an Exchange Server
version 5.0 or 5.5 computer that is acting as the site's replication bridgehead
server, the following error message may be appear:

   STOP
   This Private Information Store is being used. Remove the Directory
   Replication Connector first.

CAUSE
=====

In Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5, the information store is used to
deliver and receive inter-site replication messages. The Directory service uses
MAPI calls to communicate with the store for this purpose. In Exchange Server
4.0, the above error message does not appear because the Directory service
communicates directly with the message transfer agent (MTA) for inter-site
replication communications.
