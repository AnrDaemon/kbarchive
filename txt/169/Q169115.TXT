SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to import your Dial-up Networking Phonebook entries into Windows
NT 4.0 from another installation of Windows NT 4.0. This article explains how to
import the phonebook entries.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To import your Dial-up Networking Phonebook entries, complete the following
steps.

NOTE: The Phonebook.pbk files from different computers cannot be merged. Also,
this process cannot be done between computers running Windows NT 3.51 and
Windows NT 4.0.

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

NOTE: If you are running Service Pack 4 (SP4) or Service Pack 5 (SP5), substitute
the file name Rasphone.pbk for Phonebook.bpk in the following steps.

1. Rename the Phonebook.pbk file in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Ras directory on
   the target computer.

2. Copy the Phonebook.pbk file from the %SystemRoot%\System32\Ras directory of
   the source installation into the same directory on the target installation.

Windows NT 3.51
---------------

Importing your phonebook is also possible between two computers running Windows
NT 3.51. The steps are the same as above, the difference is the file name is
Rasphone.pbk.
