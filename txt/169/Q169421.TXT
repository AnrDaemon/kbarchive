 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Mastering Visual Basic 5.0 Fundamentals on a computer running
Windows NT Workstation 4.0, you may receive the following error message

   A random file will be placed in the Winnt\System32 directory, named
   <nnnnnnnn>.Dll

where <nnnnnnnn> is 8 random, hexadecimal digits.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Internet Explorer from the Mastering CD, or any
of the Microsoft programming tools used by the labs. This will allow the file to
be properly replaced and registered.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mastering Visual Basic
5.0 Fundamentals version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The random file is a copy of System\Oleaut32.dll from the Mastering Visual Basic
5.0 Fundamentals CD. Although the existing version of Oleaut32.dll should be
replaced during setup, it remains unchanged even after restarting the computer.
