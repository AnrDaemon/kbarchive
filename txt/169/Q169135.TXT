PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0; winnt:1.2

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you compile a graphic file specified under the "Installation Interface
Attribute," the following message appears:

   The graphic file does not contain a valid header. Please check if this is a
   valid bitmap file.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server Installer does not allow you to compile graphics
files other than bitmap (.bmp) files. This is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, convert the graphic file to a bitmap before
compiling it.
