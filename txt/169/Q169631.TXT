TITLE   :XCON: MTA Runs Internal MTACHECK After Command-Line Version
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT: 4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the command-line utility MTACHECK, located in the Exchsrvr\Bin
directory, the MTA runs the internal version of MTACHECK upon startup.

CAUSE
=====

When the MTA service starts, it checks for a placeholder file (Dbbitmp.dat) to
see if the service last stopped without an error. If the file is missing, then
the MTA will run an internal MTACHECK in order verify database integrity. In the
4.0 and 5.0 versions of Exchange, the command line version of MTACHECK does not
create this placeholder file and therefore the MTA assumes the MTA database
needs to be checked.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0. This problem has been fixed in Exchange Server version
5.5.
