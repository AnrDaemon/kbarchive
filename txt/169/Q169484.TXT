TITLE   :FIX: CString::MakeUpper and MakeLower Don't Work with Some Char
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVC500bug kbVC500SP1fix kbGrpDSMFCATL kbNoUpdate

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual Studio 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

MakeUpper() and MakeLower() in Visual C++ 5.0 do not convert the extended
characters, such as A (with circle accent), A or O (with umlauts). 

CAUSE
=====

MakeUpper() and MakeLower() were working correctly with the extended characters
in Visual C++ 4.0, but not in Visual C++ 5.0. In Visual C++ 4.0,
CString::MakeUpper() and MakeLower() functions are wrappers for the SDK
functions CharUpper() and CharLower(). They work correctly for the extended
characters, such as [ASCII 197],[ASCII 196],[ASCII 214]. In Visual C++ 5.0, the
MakeUpper() and MakeLower() functions use the C Runtime _tcslwr and _tcsupr to
convert the characters, instead of CharUpper and CharLower. As a result, the
extended characters are not being converted anymore.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem can be avoided by using the SDK APIs CharUpper() and CharLower()
instead of the CString functions.

STATUS
======

This problem has been corrected in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 1.
