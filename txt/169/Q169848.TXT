TITLE   :XADM: Performance Optimizer Fails with Low Disk Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Exchange Server Performance Optimizer, it may fail
and display the following error message:

   The following drives could not be tested due to an error (drives affected).

RESOLUTION
==========

Performance Optimizer performs various tests on the drives during its
optimization process. The error above can be generated when too little free
space is available on the drive. Microsoft recommends a minimum of 10 MB free on
each drive before running Performance Optimizer.

The error may also be generated by actual problems with the drive. Look for drive
errors in the Windows NT Event Viewer System log from before the Performance
Optimizer was run. Errors about the drive generated while Optimizer is being run
may be caused by too little free space.

This behavior is by product design
