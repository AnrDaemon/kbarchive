TITLE   :SMS: SMS 1.2 SP2 Does Not Prompt for a Restart of Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup smsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply Systems Management Server Service Pack 2 to a site, the clients
are automatically upgraded. In Service Pack 1, this upgrade process notified the
user to restart Windows for all the changes to take effect during verification.
However, Service Pack 2 does not always provide this notification.

Note that the Windows NT dialog box for Systems Management Server Client Services
Change Notification continues to function as normal.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, ensure that all Windows Systems Management Server
clients are restarted after Service Pack 2 has been installed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2 Service Pack 2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
