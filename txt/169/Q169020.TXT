TITLE   :32-bit Help Fails to Start When 16-bit Help Is Running
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT cannot open a 32-bit help file if a 16-bit help file is already open.
You get the following error message:

   This file is not a Windows Help file.

When you click OK, you receive the following error message:

   A newer version of Help is needed to view this Help file.

Windows NT supports both 16-bit and 32-bit Help files. Windows NT uses
Winhelp.exe for 16-bit Help files and Winhlp32.exe for 32-bit Help file.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when a user tries to open a 32-bit Help file but already has
a 16-bit version of Help running. Windows NT, instead of starting the 32-bit
Help engine, will pass the 32-bit Help file to the 16-bit Help engine. As a
result, the user will get the error message.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
