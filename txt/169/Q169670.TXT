TITLE   :XCON: Incoming Messages from HP OpenMail Include Winmail.dat
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Attachments on incoming messages from a Hewlett-Packard (HP) OpenMail X.400
connector may include a Winmail.dat attachment if the Microsoft Exchange Server
Message Transfer Agent (MTA) is build 995.17 or higher. HP OpenMail can use
Microsoft Mail clients with an HP MAPI driver.

CAUSE
=====

The remote system may be sending the Winmail.dat as an FTBP of type
mapiAttachment. This is the same value being used for attached files. Normally,
the Winmail.dat file is tagged as type TNEF. When the MTA sees the
mapiAttachment tag, it assumes it is just another bodypart, and handles it
accordingly. If the bodypart was tagged as type TNEF, the MTA would parse it out
and use the details inside.

MapiAttachment uses the OID 0x2a864886f714030a02

TNEF uses the OID 0x2a864886f714030a01

The OID can be seen in the ASN.1 parsed data in the attribute
P2_RegisteredIdentifier. Microsoft provides an ASN.1 parser in the BackOffice
Resource Kit called Aspirin.

WORKAROUND
==========

Configure the HP OpenMail MAPI driver to not generate a Winmail.dat file on
outgoing messages. This is done in the Msmail.ini file, in the following
section:

      [OpenDesk Transport]
      EncodeAttachInfo=1

If EncodeAttachInfo is "0", the Winmail.dat file will not be generated. If it is
a "1", the Winmail.dat file will be generated.

If the workaround is impractical to implement, see the status section for a
possible resolution.
