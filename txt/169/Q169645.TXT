SYMPTOMS
========

When you look at the Windows NT Application log for Microsoft Exchange Server
Event Ids, the following may appear:

   The description for Event ID ( 9996 ) in Source ( MSExchangeMTA ) could not
   be found.
   It contains the following insertion string(s): ExitProcess called in file:
   K:\MTA\src\emsmta\sysglue\sbnilnt.c; line: 2156.

The text for this message will vary, but it will always report the description
could not be found.

CAUSE
=====

This is a generic event that occurs when an informational condition or error
arises and there is no error string matching exactly. The event pops up with the
location in the source code of the error. More often then not this event is
informational or non-critical, and represents normal MTA housekeeping. If an
actual problem does exist; other Event IDs will be present to indicate the
problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
