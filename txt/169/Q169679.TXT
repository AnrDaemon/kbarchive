TITLE   :XADM: Messages Sent with MIME/JIS Encoding May Not Be Readable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When your Microsoft Exchange Server is configured to use MIME/JIS (Japanese
Industry Standards, code set for Japanese character), some messages that you
send to Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) users may not be readable.

CAUSE
=====

With Microsoft Exchange Server set up to use a MIME/JIS configuration, messages
are expected to be encoded with 7-bit data. However, if an invalid character is
included in the message, the message will be encoded Quoted- Printable. Some
mail readers do not support Quoted-Printable, and if they receive messages
encoded in Quoted-Printable, the messages will not be readable.

Some applications generate the character 0x9520, which is an invalid CP932
character. If you copy this character, paste it into a Microsoft Exchange
message, and send it to an SMTP user, this problem will occur.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
