TITLE   :Cannot Size Pre-Dial and After Dial Terminal Screen
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenable kbui kbEnableSight kbEnableLearn

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are unable to change the screen size, the screen font size, or the colors
for the Pre-Dial Terminal Screen and After Dial Terminal windows in Dial-Up
Networking.

CAUSE
=====

The Pre-Dial Terminal Screen and After Dial Terminal windows are hard-coded for
their appearance, including the screen size, screen font size, and colors.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Use a logon script, if possible, for your Dial-Up Networking connection so
   that the terminal window is not required. For more information, see the
   Generic logon script, found in the Switch.inf file located in the
   %SystemRoot%\System32\Ras directory.

 - Temporarily change the display resolution to 640x480 (standard VGA) when
   dialing any Dial-Up Networking connection that requires a Pre-Dial Terminal
   Screen or an After Dial Terminal.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
