TITLE   :XFOR: cc:Mail DB8 Migration Creates Randomized Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Exchange Migration Wizard to migrate cc:Mail users to Exchange
Server, the Exchange Migration Wizard sets the users old cc:Mail postoffice
passwords to random strings and stores them in the password list. The password
list will show the current passwords.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Migration Wizard selects the randomized passwords by design. This
is to prevent users from continuing to use their old cc:Mail accounts. It is
unlikely that users will ever need their cc:Mail accounts again.

In the event of some sort of migration failure, along with a failure in the
original backup of the cc:Mail postoffice, the password list will serve as the
key to getting back into the mailboxes. If users need their old cc:Mail
accounts, an administrator can look up the cc:Mail passwords in the password
list.
