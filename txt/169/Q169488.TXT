TITLE   :Errors When Performance Monitoring SNA Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you initially activate Windows NT Server Performance Monitor to collect SNA
Server performance data, the following errors may occur:

 - Perfmon.exe may encounter an access violation.

 - If SNA Server is running on Windows NT Server 3.51, a Winlogon.exe access
   violation may occur, leading to a STOP 0x0000001E error.

 - If SNA Server is running on Windows NT Server 4.0, the following event may be
   logged in the Windows NT application event log:

      Event ID: 1013
      Source: Perflib
      Description:
      The collect procedure in Extensible Counter DLL
      "C:\SNA\system\snaperf.dll" for the "SnaServr" service returned a
      buffer that was larger than the space allocated and may have
      corrupted the application's heap. This DLL should be disabled or
      removed from the system until the problem has been corrected to
      prevent further corruption. The application accessing this
      performance data should be restarted. The Performance data returned
      by counter DLL will be not be returned in Perf Data Block. Overflow
      size is data DWORD 0.

 - If SNA Server is running on Windows NT 4.0, a winlogon.exe access violation
   may occur, which would cause the following log entry in the
   <ntroot>\drwtsn32.log file:

      Application exception occurred:
      App: exe\winlogon.dbg (<process ID>)
      Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)
      [...]
      function: RtlAllocateHeap
      [...]
      FAULT ->77f64654 0fb716           movzx   edx,word ptr [esi]

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server performance monitoring collection routine returns a Buffer Size
greater than the Perfmon buffer pointer allocated. The data collection routines
AddNodeCounters and AddRTMCounters write data to the buffer, but fail to
decrement the remaining byte count, which results in the buffer write operation
going past the end of the buffer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix, the code has been modified to decrement the remaining byte count
for the Node and RTM counter collections.
