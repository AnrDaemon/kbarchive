TITLE   :PPT7: Text Box Alignment Lost When Saved as PowerPoint 4.0 File
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a text box in Microsoft PowerPoint and set different alignment
attributes to the paragraphs in the text box, the text box may shift to a new
position and the paragraph alignment may be incorrect after you save the file in
PowerPoint 4.0 format.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a text placeholder instead of a text box. When you apply different alignment
attributes in a text placeholder, the correct alignment is retained when you
save your file in PowerPoint 4.0 format.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following are two examples of how the text box and paragraph alignment change
when you save a PowerPoint 7.0 file as a PowerPoint 4.0 file:

Example 1

If you have four paragraphs in a text box, where paragraphs one and three are
centered and paragraphs two and four are left-aligned, the text box shifts to
the right and all four paragraphs are formatted with left alignment.

Example 2

If you have four paragraphs in a text box, where paragraphs two and three are
left-aligned, and paragraphs one and four are center-aligned, the text box does
not shift, but all of the text is center-aligned.
