TITLE   :BUG: Cannot Add Pictures into ComboBox in Init Event
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500 kbvfp500a

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 5.0 or 5.0a, setting the Picture property of a ComboBox object
in the Init event of the object does not display pictures or icons within the
ComboBox. However, the pictures do appear in ComboBox objects running under
Visual FoxPro 3.0 and 3.0b.

RESOLUTION
==========

Several workarounds exist for this behavior. First, you can place the following
code in the GotFocus event of the ComboBox object:

      This.Picture(1)=Home()+"samples\graphics\bmps\assorted\balloon.bmp"
      This.Picture(2)=Home()+"samples\graphics\bmps\assorted\cup.bmp"

You can also place the following code in the Refresh event of the ComboBox
object:

      IF EMPTY(THIS.PICTURE(1))
        THIS.PICTURE(1)=Home()+"samples\graphics\bmps\assorted\balloon.bmp"
        THIS.PICTURE(2)=Home()+"samples\graphics\bmps\assorted\cup.bmp"
      ENDIF

Finally, if you need to leave the original code in the Init of the ComboBox, then
place this code in the Activate event of the form:

      IF EMPTY(THIS.combo1.PICTURE(1))
         THIS.combo1.Init()
      ENDIF

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
