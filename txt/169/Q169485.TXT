TITLE   :3270 LU Assignments to Workstations Not Saved Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you assign, delete or add 3270 LUs (or pooled LUs) to workstations, the
changes may fail to be saved, or may cause other workstation assignments to
unexpectedly change. This problem can occur when you use SNA Server Manager or
the command-line Snacfg.exe tool.

CAUSE
=====

Workstation records (new to SNA Server 3.0) are stored as extended records in
the SNA Server configuration file. The method of storing LU assignments to
workstations failed to properly accommodate the assignment of pooled 3270 LUs,
or if the same 3270 LU is assigned to more than one workstation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
