TITLE   :Routing Protocols Changes Not Updated in Routing and RAS Admin
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Removing a routing protocol from Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) is not
accurately reflected in the RRAS Administrator tool. To remove a routing
protocol on a RRAS router you must use the command-line utility ROUTEMON. If
RRAS Administrator is active when you remove a routing protocol, the graphical
user interface will not reflect the change. Also, if you add a routing protocol
from the command line, the protocol will not be reflected in RRAS Administrator.

RESOLUTION
==========

Quit and restart Routing and Remote Access Service Administrator. When Routing
and Remote Access Service Administrator is restarted, it will accurately reflect
removal or addition of a routing protocol.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Routing and Remote Access
Service Update. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
