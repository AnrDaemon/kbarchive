TITLE   :NetBIOS and Hostname Resolution for MS-Client and LM 2.2c
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:2.2c 3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2c 
 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Network clients that use the LAN Manager 2.2c client or Microsoft Network Client
3.0 fail to resolve hostnames using broadcasts (b-node.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design.

Host Name Resolution
--------------------

If the LAN Manager 2.2c or Microsoft Network Client 3.0 is attempting to resolve
a host name, it will use the gethostbyname() call, that is resolved by entries
in the HOSTS file and, optionally, a Domain Name Service (DNS) server. These
clients DO NOT use WINS, LMHOSTS or broadcast to resolve hostnames. For
information on configuring the Domain Name Resolver (DNR) for these clients, see
the Readme.txt on the appropriate clients directory where you installed from.

NOTE: This is different behavior than the Windows For Workgroups, Windows 95, and
Windows NT clients that can also resolve hostnames through WINS, LMHOSTS files
and broadcasts. For more information about node type settings in Windows For
Workgroups, Windows 95, and Windows NT, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

NetBIOS Name Resolution
-----------------------

If the LAN Manager 2.2c client or Microsoft Network 3.0 client is attempting to
resolve a NetBIOS name (for example, using the 'NET USE' command), the name may
be resolved using LMHOSTS entries, WINS query, or broadcast. These clients do
NOT use DNS or HOSTS queries to resolve NetBIOS names.
