TITLE   :FIX: "Invalid Argument Value" Error with SQLSetConnectOption
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG #: 4622 (ODBC30)

SYMPTOMS
========

When SQL_ODBC_CURSORS is set to SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC using the SQLSetConnectOption
and a connection to a data source is made, the next call to SQLSetConnectOption
to set the SQL_CURRENT_QUALIFIER or SQL_ATTR_CURRENT_CATALOG fails with the
following message:

   szSqlState = "S1009", *pfNativeError = 0, *pcbErrorMsg = 55
   szErrorMsg = "[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Invalid argument value"

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use SQLSetConnectOption to set the SQL_ODBC_CURSORS
to SQL_CUR_USE_IF_NEEDED or SQL_CUR_USE_DRIVER. The ODBC Cursor Library version
3.00.2822 resolves this issue.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Open Database
Connectivity version 3.0. This problem has been corrected in U.S. Service Pack 1
for Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0. For more information,
contact your primary support provider.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is only seen with ODBC 2.X applications using a Driver Manager 3.0
and a 2.X ODBC driver.
