TITLE   :PRB: VisData Returns Incorrect Number of Records
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When entering SQL statements in Visual Basic 5.0 Visual Data Manager (VisData),
the record count may be incorrect. The same SQL statement entered in Visual
Basic 4.0 Data Manager will return the correct number of records.

CAUSE
=====

All records do appear in some circumstances, such as with the DBGrid control,
Data Manager, etc., because in these circumstances all records need to be
retrieved to be displayed to the user, in which case there is no need to
explicitly call MoveLast.

RESOLUTION
==========

Always go the last record in VisData or issue a MoveLast of a recordset variable
in order to get the correct record count using the DBGrid.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Within VisData:

1. Open Nwind.mdb.

2. Enter the following SQL statement:

        select * from customers where customers.customerid like "*"

3. Execute the statement and note that VisData will report two records being
   returned.

In Visual Basic 4.0 Data Manager:

1. Open Nwind.mdb.

2. Enter the same SQL Statement and note that Data Manager returns 91 records.
