TITLE   :Cannot Select System.dat File with Emergency Recovery Utility
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Emergency Recovery Utility (ERU) that is included on the
Windows 95 CD-ROM, you may be unable to select the System.dat check box.

CAUSE
=====

The System.dat file is too large to fit on a floppy disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

To back up the System.dat file with the ERU, back up to a folder on your hard
disk with enough free space for the System.dat file and any other files you
select. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Double-click the Eru.exe file in the Other\Misc\Eru folder on the Windows 95
   CD-ROM.

2. Click Next.

3. When you are prompted "Please select the drive or path in which you wish to
   save the emergency recovery information," click Other Directory.

4. Click Next.

5. In the Directory box, type the path of the folder you are backing up to, and
   then click Next.

6. Click Custom.

7. Click a file to select or clear the check box. By default, files listed in
   the Optional Files box are all selected for backup.

8. Click OK, and then click Next. The ERU copies the files selected.

9. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you select the System.dat check box and the System.dat file is too large to
fit on a floppy disk, the box briefly appears to be checked before it is cleared
by the ERU.
