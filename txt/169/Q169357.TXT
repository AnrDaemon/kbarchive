TITLE   :WinNT SP3 Says Mtxdm.dll Older Than Currently Installed Version
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 4.0, you may get the warning that
the version of Mtxdm.dll is older than the currently installed version.

CAUSE
=====

The Mtxdm.dll that comes with Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 is the version that
was tested with the ODBC drivers that come with the service pack. The changes
made to Mtxdm.dll did not affect ODBC, and therefore the file was not updated.
If you have a newer version of this DLL, you do not have to overwrite it with
the older version. The new version will work fine with Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 3.

RESOLUTION
==========

When the Service Pack 3 installation program asks if you want to overwrite the
newer version, select NO so the file will not be overwritten.
