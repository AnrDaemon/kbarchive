TITLE   :FP: TAB Key Doesn't Work As Expected in FrontPage Editor
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER:windows:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In FrontPage Editor, when you press the TAB key, one space is inserted instead
of five spaces.

CAUSE
=====

The functionality of the TAB key is not supported in FrontPage Editor. If you
press TAB outside of some Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) elements, the Web
browser that renders the HTML collapses the tab spacing to a single character
space. However, you can use TAB inside some HTML elements, such as the
<PRE>...</PRE> element, which render the text in a monospaced font.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1. Use a Non-breaking Space
----------------------------------

Press CTRL+SHIFT+SPACE (Windows) or OPTION+SHIFT+SPACE (Macintosh) for each non-
breaking (&nbsp;) space you want to insert.

Method 2. Use Formatted Text
----------------------------

The Formatted text option applies the <pre>...</pre> element to your
text. To apply Formatted text, use the following steps:

1. On the Format menu, click Paragraph.

2. In the Paragraph Formatted list, select Formatted.

3. Click OK.

When you press TAB, FrontPage Editor inserts five spaces.
