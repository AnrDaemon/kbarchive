The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program to view the Mailbox
Resources on a server, not all the mailboxes listed in the Recipients container
are displayed in the Mailbox Resources.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, information about the
mailboxes on a Microsoft Exchange Server computer can be obtained. This
information, such as a Windows NT account, number of items, or logon/logoff
times, is obtained by selecting the Mailbox Resources page of the private
information store under the server object. Because the information displayed on
the Mailbox Resources page is obtained from the information store, only objects
that are present in the information store are displayed. When a mailbox is
created, a directory object is created for that mailbox, but an information
store object is not. An information store object is created when a user logs on
to the mailbox, or a message is mailed to the mailbox. Therefore, only those
mailboxes that contain mail or that have been logged on to are displayed in the
Mailbox Resources page of the private information store.
