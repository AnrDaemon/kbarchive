The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT 4.0 detects the Madge Smart 16/4 PCI Ringnode Bus Master 2 (BM2)
Token Ring adapter as the Madge Smart 16/4 PCI Ringnode Bus Master (BM) adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install the Madge Smart 16/4 PCI Ringnode BM2 Token
Ring adapter driver that is included with Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3. To do
this:

NOTE: Windows NT 4.0 does not ship a driver for the Madge Smart 16/4 PCI Ringnode
Bus Master 2 (BM2) Token Ring adapter. If you use the Madge Smart 16/4 PCI
Ringnode Bus Master (BM) Token Ring adapter driver, the Madge Smart 16/4 PCI
Ringnode Bus Master (BM2) Token Ring adapter will not function in DMA mode.

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click the Network icon.

2. Click the Adapters tab, click Madge Smart 16/4 PCI Ringnode Bus Master (BM)
   Adapter, click Remove, and then click Yes.

3. Shut down and restart Windows NT.

4. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click the Network icon.

5. Click the Adapters tab, click Add, click Madge Smart 16/4 PCI Ringnode Bus
   Master 2 (BM2) Adapter, then click OK.

   NOTE: If the Madge Smart 16/4 PCI Ringnode Bus Master 2 (BM2) does not appear,
   verify that you have Service Pack 3 installed.

The Configuration dialog box permits the following transfer method selections:

 - PIO sets the Madge Smart 16/4 PCI Ringnode Bus Master 2 (BM2) or the Madge
   Smart 16/4 PCI Ringnode Bus Master (BM) to PIO mode.

 - The MMIO choice sets the Bus Master 2 to DMA mode and the PCI Ringnode to
   MMIO mode.
