SUMMARY
=======

The sample .csv files that are included on the Exchange Server 4.0 CD are not on
the Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5 CDs. These .csv files were located on the
Exchange Server 4.0 CD in the following location:

   Support\Samples\Csvs

The sample files included are: Mailbox.csv, Dl.csv, Custom.csv, Cust_att.csv, and
tpl.csv.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can still use the .csv files from the Exchange Server 4.0 CD for exporting
and importing in Exchange Server 5.0 or 5.5. If you do not have the Exchange 4.0
CD, the sample CSVs are located in the following file that can be downloaded
from the Microsoft Download Center:

   Csv.exe
   http://download.microsoft.com/download/exch55/Utility/5.5/NT45/EN-US/CSV.exe

If you are unable to download or locate the .csv files, the Header.exe utility
from the BackOffice Resource Kit can be used instead to create a .csv file with
only the required headers for importing.
