TITLE   :XADM: Import Fails with Event ID 13 and ID 235
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you import a .csv file, the import command may fail and the event viewer
application log may report errors similar to the following:

   Event ID: 13
   Source: X400Proxy
   Type: Warning
   Category: None
   Description: Unable to process custom recipient Arcand, Lyne: BLUEMOON
   because the target
   address is not valid.
   X400:/C[ASCII 202]/A=TEL.CAN/G=Lyne/S=Arcand/O=BLUEMOON/OU1=CISTI.NRC.OTT/ 
   DDA:ID=ILL.CISTI

   Event ID: 235
   Source: MSExchangeDSImp
   Type: Error
   Category: None
   Description: X400 address failure. An illegal type name was specified at
   character position
   87 of 'X400:/C[ASCII 202]/A=TEL.CAN/G=Lyne/S=Arcand/O=BLUEMOON/OU1=CISTI.NRC.OTT/ 
   DDA:ID=ILL.CISTI'.

CAUSE
=====

The .csv file may contain Domain Defined Attributes (DDA) values. DDA is the
format used for custom recipients such as Microsoft Mail users or SMTP users.
The Exchange Server import function does not properly handle incoming X.400
addresses that contain a forward slash (or solidus) as part of a DDA Value. When
Exchange Server encounters a forward slash as part of a DDA value, it reports an
error. The X.400 custom recipient is not created in Exchange Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

1. Edit the .csv file and globally replace /DDA with ;DDA.

2. Save and close the .csv file and re-import it into Exchange Server by
   clicking Import on the Tools menu.
