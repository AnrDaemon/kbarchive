TITLE   :SNA Print Service Leak When All Print Sessions Are Stopped
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Memory is not de-allocated when all print sessions are stopped.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Print service fails to de-allocate 317 KB of memory after each time all
printer session are stopped.

Every time a first session starts, a new thread is created. When the number of
sessions goes down to zero, the thread is destroyed but not all memory hanging
off this thread is freed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 sp1. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following word in

MORE INFORMATION
================

A change was made so that threads are never destroyed until SNAPrint Service is
actually stopped. The threads will wait around until a new session uses them.
