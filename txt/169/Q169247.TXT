TITLE   :PPT7: Action Items/Speaker Notes Not Saved After Slide Show
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you right-click a PowerPoint presentation in Windows Explorer, and click Show
on the menu that appears, PowerPoint starts and runs the presentation as a slide
show. While you are running the slide show, you can add an Action Items slide
and Speaker Notes. When the slide show finishes, however, the presentation
closes and you are not asked to save any changes. When you reopen the
presentation, the Action Items slide and/or Speaker Notes you just added are
missing.

CAUSE
=====

The presentation file has a read-only attribute. When you use the Show command
on the shortcut menu in Windows Explorer, PowerPoint does not display a
read-only warning.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem and modify a presentation during a slide show, open the
presentation in PowerPoint, and then run the slide show.
