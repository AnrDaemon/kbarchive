SUMMARY
=======

This article briefly describes what a Frameset is and how to create a Web page
using the Microsoft FrontPage Frames Wizard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Frameset is a special Web page that defines a set of named scrollable regions
in which other pages are displayed.

To create a Frameset, do the following:

1. Start FrontPage Editor.

2. On the File menu, click New.

3. In the Template Or Wizard box, select Frames Wizard, and then click OK.

4. On the Choose Technique panel, click Pick A Template. Click Next.

5. On the Pick Template Layout panel, select a frame layout from the Layout box.
   Click Next.

   When you click a layout format, the preview on the left changes to show you
   how your frames page will be laid out. Note that each frame is labeled with
   its name. A description of the selected layout appears below the Layout list.

6. On the Choose Alternate Content panel, in the Alternate page URL box, type
   the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for an alternate page.

   The alternate page will be displayed if the web browser does not support
   frames. Click Next.

7. On the Save Page panel, in the Title box, type the title you want for the
   frame set. In the URL box, type the URL for the frame set. Click Finish.
