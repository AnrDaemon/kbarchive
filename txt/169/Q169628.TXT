TITLE   :XCON: MTA May Hang After Running from the Command Line
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) may hang and/or
generate database errors after it runs from the command line.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MTA is normally started as a service known as MSExchange MTA. However, it is
possible to start the MTA from the Exchsrvr\bin directory, if you run Emsmta.exe
from the command line. The MTA will function normally, but you will need to use
the CTRL-C keystroke combination at the command line to stop the MTA. After you
stop the MTA using the CTRL-C keystroke combination, the server needs to be
rebooted if it is expected to go back into a production role. Running Emsmta.exe
from the command line should only be attempted when MTA debugging is needed.
This should never be considered normal operation. This behavior is by product
design.
