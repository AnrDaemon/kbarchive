TITLE   :Err Msg: Database Already in Use w/ MS Access DB on Remote Share
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use a Microsoft Access database with Internet Information Server
(IIS) where the database is located on a remote share, you may get the following
error message:

   Database already in use

CAUSE
=====

This error message is actually caused because the connection is denied access to
the share.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create an account on the server that contains the share for the Microsoft Access
database that matches the IUSR account on the IIS server.

For example:

IIS Server user account = IUSR_IISBOX
Remote server: Create an account called IUSR_IISBOX and make sure the password
matches the IUSR_IISBOX account on the IIS server.

If necessary, change the password on both accounts so they match and remember to
change the password in the Internet Service Manager on the IIS server to match.
