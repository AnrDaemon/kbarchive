SUMMARY
=======

In a multiple-site environment, sites other than the site where LinkAge Message
Exchange is installed need the proxy generator and the address template to send
and receive mail with the connected systems.

The following instructions identify the steps necessary to install the proxy
generator and the address template for the LinkAge Exchange-OV/VM Connector on a
site separate from the site where the connector is installed.

1. The following files are required for these steps, and can be obtained from
   the C:\Linkage\Install directory on the currently installed LinkAge
   connector:

    - Mexitmpl.exe

    - Exiaddr.exe

    - Ibmpxgen.dll

    - Ibmscr.blt

    - Ibmadt.blt

    - Ibmadt.hlp

2. Create a C:\Linkage\Install directory on the Exchange Server computer in the
   site where the proxy generator and the address template are to be installed,
   and copy the above files to this directory.

3. Create the following directory where the PROFS proxy address generator will
   exist:

      \\MEXServerName\Address\PROFS\I386

4. Copy the following file into the directory created in step 3:

   Ibmpxgen.dll

5. Run the following command from the C:\Linkage\Install directory to install
   the PROFS address template on the Exchange Server computer:

         mexitmpl "/org=MEXOrganization" "/site=MEXSite"
         "/Server=MEXServerName" /ADDRTYPE=PROFS
         /SYNTAX=c:\linkage\install\ibmscr.blt
         /ADDRESS_DT=c:\linkage\install\ibmadt.blt
         /LANGUAGE=409 /FILE=c:\linkage\install\ibmadt.hlp
         /DATA16=c:\linkage\install\ibmadt.hlp
         /DATA32=c:\linkage\install\ibmadt.hlp /SF

6. Check the following files to see if any errors occurred with the above
   command:

    - Lmeistat.txt

    - Lmeilog.txt

7. Run the following command from the C:\Linkage\Install directory to install
   the proxy address rule and to optionally generate proxy addresses:

         mexiaddr "/org=MEXOrganization" "/site=MEXSite"
         /Server=MEXServerName"  /ADDRTYPE=PROFS
         /MACHINE=I386 "/PROXYRULE=PROFS:nodeid(&m)"
         /PROXYDLL=c:\linkage\install\ibmpxgen.dll  /SF

   Replace nodeid with the node ID assigned to the connector.

   If proxy addresses are NOT to be generated, then insert /NOGENADDR before the
   /SF

8. Check the following file to see if any errors occurred with the above
   command:

    - Lmeistat.txt

    - Lmeilog.txt
