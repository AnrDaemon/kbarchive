   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you restore an on-line backup, the information store produces a service
specific error 0x00000057. The following event ID is generated in the
application event log:

   Event ID: 1081
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Description: MSExchangeIS is unable to recover the database because error
   0x00000057 occurred after a restore operation.

CAUSE
=====

When the information store tries to start after an on-line restore, it attempts
to read the RestoreInProgress key to determine how to handle the on-line
restore. In this case, the Data parameter in the EDB_RstMap value was corrupt,
and Microsoft Information Store service failed attempting to read this string.

Hex 57 converts to Dec. 87. When using NET HELPMSG 87, this produces the error
message:

   The parameter is incorrect.

The Exchange Server-aware backup software restored the RestoreInProgress key
incorrectly. The EDB_RstMap value had invalid entries in the DATA field. It
looked as follows:

Name:  EDB_RstMap
   Type:  Reg_Multi_SZ
   Data:  \\Server\D$\exchsrvr\mdbdata\pub.edb
   \\Server\D$\exchsrvr\mdbdata\priv.edb
   q
   \\Server\D$\exchsrvr\mdbdata\PUB.

Note the line with the q.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To correct the problem, the above string needs to be modified to reflect the
proper database paths. Do the following:

1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the EDB_RstMap registry value under the following key in the
   registry:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\Res
      toreInProgress

3. Click String on the Edit menu, type the appropriate paths, and then click
   OK.

   Here is an example of a correct EDB_RstMap Key:

      Value 3
         Name:  EDB_RstMap
         Type:  Reg_Multi_SZ
         Data:  \\<Server_Name>\D$\exchsrvr\mdbdata\priv.edb
                  \\<Server_Name>\D$\exchsrvr\mdbdata\priv.edb
                \\<Server_Name>\D$\exchsrvr\mdbdata\pub.edb
                  \\<Server_Name>\D$\exchsrvr\mdbdata\pub.edb

4. Quit the Registry Editor.
