TITLE   :XADM: Exchange 5.5 Remove All Option Removes Database Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Setup in Maintenance mode, and you
select the Remove All option, the Exchange Server databases are deleted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In previous versions of Microsoft Exchange Server, if you select the option to
Remove All, the Exchange Server database files remain intact. This has changed
in version 5.5, and these files are deleted. Therefore, it is imperative that
you back up all database files before running Remove All.

NOTE: Remove All will not remove Key Management Server databases. This is by
design.
