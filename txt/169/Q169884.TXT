TITLE   :FIX: Unattended Setup Is Unable to Invoke External Program
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the /e switch to automatically run a program at the end of Windows
NT Setup, you may receive the following error message at the end of the Setup
process:

   One or more minor errors occurred installing Windows NT. The errors will not
   prevent Windows NT from running.

   After Windows NT starts, you can check the Setup log file
   (%SystemRoot%\setuplog.txt) for more information.

   Would you like to view the log file now?

The Setuplog.txt file contains the following text:

   Warning:
   Setup was unable to invoke external program
   <drive>:\<directory>\<program> because of the following
   error: CreateProcess returned error 3.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the drive letter you specified with the /e switch was
mapped to a network drive. The network drive no longer exists after Windows NT
Setup reboots your computer during the Setup process.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, specify a local drive letter from which to run the
external program.

STATUS
======

 

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT Workstation Deployment Guide to Automating Windows NT Setup cites
the following command line on page 121 as an example of using the /e switch to
install a Service Pack automatically after an unattended Setup:

   WINNT.EXE /U:UNATTEND.TXT /S:X:\ /E:"X:\SP\UPDATE.EXE /U /Z"

However, it does not specify that the "X:" following the /E switch must represent
a local drive and cannot be a network drive. In this example, the Service Pack
would need to be copied to the local hard drive prior to using the command, and
the "X:" must be replaced with the local drive letter.
