TITLE   :XADM: Store.exe May Access Violate While Replicating PFs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server information store may generate an access violation
in Store.exe while replicating public folders.

CAUSE
=====

The length of the buffer that holds the path to the public folder to be
replicated was calculated incorrectly, resulting in a buffer too small to hold
the path string. When the path to the public folder was written to the buffer,
the buffer was overwritten and the header to the adjacent buffer in the heap was
corrupted.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
