TITLE   :FP: Clicking Alignment Buttons on Format Toolbar Misaligns Cells
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER:windows:1.1,97; macintosh:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows 1.1 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click one of the alignment buttons (Align Left, Center, or Align Right)
on the Format toolbar to format text inside a table cell, an extra line space is
added to the cell, and the text loses its horizontal alignment relative to other
cells within the same row. This behavior does not occur in FrontPage 98 for
Windows.

CAUSE
=====

The alignment buttons on the Format toolbar change paragraph formatting.

RESOLUTION
==========

To align the text inside a table cell without inserting an extra line space and
to maintain its relative position with other cells in the same row, follow these
steps:

1. On the Table menu, click Cell Properties.

2. Under Layout, in the Horizontal Alignment list, click Left, Center, or Right.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft FrontPage
98 for Windows.
