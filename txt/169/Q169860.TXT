The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Message Transfer Agent (MTA) may produce the
following error when a message arrives from a third-party MTA.

   message NMI0210: X.400 Service Event, severity 14
      (MTA XFER-IN(26) Proc 112) 04-28-97 01:48:11am
      Content conversion failed
         Object at fault     0600004D
         Conversion error    26
   MTS Identifier
   C=UA;A=ADMD;P=PRMD;L=1002233servername
         Old content type    56010A00
         New content type    2A864886F7140501
         PDU dump reference  1

The item of direct interest is the Conversion error 26 that indicates a malformed
P2 (Content).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a third-party X.400 system sends a message which has incorrect values for the
P2 X.400 Originator and Recipient (O/R) addresses, Exchange Server is unable to
convert the message to a format that can be transferred to the Exchange Server
information store.

An example of this would be a message received from a third-party X.400 system
with an incorrect value for the administrative management domain name (ADMD).
According to the 1988 CCITT (ITU) Blue Book, the maximum length of the ADMD
field is 16 characters. If this length is exceeded, then the Exchange Server
content converter will reject the message as malformed.

If this behavior is found, the manufacturer of the problematic MTA should be
consulted for a fix.
