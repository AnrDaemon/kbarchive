TITLE   :PPT: Cannot Unpack Presentation on a Macintosh Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:4.0; WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbpng

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to unpack a presentation on a Macintosh computer, you receive
one of the following errors:

   Could not find the application program that created the document named
   "Pngsetup.exe".

   To open the document, select an alternate program, with or without
   translation.

   -or-

   The document "Pngsetup.exe" could not be opened, because the application
   program that created it could not be found. Do you want to open it using
   "SimpleText"?

   -or-

   Sorry, PowerPoint cannot read the Outline from "Pngsetup.exe". No text
   converter is installed for this file type. Try saving the file again as RTF
   or in the format of one of the text converters you have installed.

CAUSE
=====

Pack and Go is intended to run only on the Microsoft Windows platform. The Pack
and Go installation program (Pngsetup.exe) is a Windows-based application. In
other words, this program does not run on a Macintosh computer. If you
double-click a Windows-based executable file (.exe) on a Macintosh computer, the
Macintosh attempts to open the file as a document and displays a list of
programs you can use if you are running the Macintosh Easy Open control panel.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use your presentation on a Macintosh computer, save the file in the
PowerPoint 95 or PowerPoint 4.0 file format instead of using Pack and Go.

Additional query words: 4.00 7.00 pack n' go compress
