PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Server documentation states that the Eicon cards are the
only X.25 cards supported by Microsoft Exchange Server. This is not true; in
some cases X.25 cards manufactured by Cirel are also supported.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The statement that only Eicon cards are supported refers only to the
installation of the X.25 protocol stack within the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program. Currently only Eicon cards can be used for an X.400
connector using a native X.25 connection.

It is possible to configure an X.400 Connector or a Site Connector using a Cirel
X.25 card. You must install the Cirel X.25 board and the PassLan/IP product so
that you can route the IP protocol over the X.25 physical link. On the Microsoft
Exchange Server computer , you can either install a Site Connector or add a
TCP/IP stack and configure an X.400 Connector. This solution produces more
protocol overhead and is not suited to very slow X.25 connections (less than
9600 bps).

REFERENCES
==========

Cirel is an X.25 board manufacturer whose FPX cards (models B, S, B AS, and S
AS) are supported by Microsoft Exchange Server on Windows NT Server versions
3.51 and 4.0.
