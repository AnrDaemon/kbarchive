TITLE   :Error Message: Installation Failed While Installing from .INF
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user, who does not belong to the Administrators local group, tries to run
an INF file by right-clicking the INF file and choosing the Install Context menu
item, the following error message appears:

   Installation failed

CAUSE
=====

The Setupapi.dll that processes the INF files [DefaultInstall] section needs to
write to the registry key HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\
CurrentVersion\RunOnce to prepare the launch of Grpconv.exe when the
installation script is completed. Because a user, not belonging to the
Administrators local group, does not have full control permission to this
registry key, the according API function, RegOpenKeyEx(), returns an error 5
(access denied). This error occurs when the Setupapi.dll attempts to open the
key using the KEY_ALL_ACCESS flag. The Setupapi.dll in turn generates the error
message "Installation failed."

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent the error message described above, either log on with an
administrative account or give the user in question (or the Users local group)
full control permission to the HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\
CurrentVersion\RunOnce registry key.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
