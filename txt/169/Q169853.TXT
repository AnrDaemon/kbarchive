TITLE   :0Ds Inserted When Transparency Is ASCII Is Selected
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you select "Transparency Is ASCII" in the SNA Print Session properties, an
extra "0D" (carriage return) may be inserted inadvertently. Bypass GDI is turned
off in this case.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in the New Line (NL) handling that can cause SNA Print
Service to sometimes fail to set the column position back to the left side of
the page. This later causes SNA Print Service to issue an extra carriage return
(0x0D) when it finds itself in the wrong position.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 Service
Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
