TITLE   :XWEB: Dates Displayed in MM/DD/YY Instead of DD/MM/YY
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you are viewing an Exchange Inbox via the Microsoft Exchange Active Server
Components, the date an item was received appears in the standard US format of
MM/DD/YY. This occurs although you expect to see DD/MM/YY.

With some Internet browsers and operating systems you can specify British English
as the language (for example, in the Windows operating systems you can select
English [United Kingdom]). In this case, you would expect the date to appear as
DD/MM/YY, in accordance with the way dates are written in the United Kingdom.
However, the date still appears as MM/DD/YY.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
