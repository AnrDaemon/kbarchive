TITLE   :Using Scopes with Different Subnet Masks in a Superscope
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2000,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a superscope made up of scopes with different subnet masks, client
computers may not be able to get an IP address using DHCP. This situation will
occur if the first scope in the superscope is full.

Example
-------

You have a single segment using the following addresses:

   192.168.1.1-255, subnet mask 255.255.255.0
   192.168.2.1-62, subnet mask 255.255.255.192

You use one DHCP server, create a scope for each network, and then create a
superscope using these two scopes. This procedure will allow your DHCP server to
assign addresses from either scope to clients on the same physical segment.

After the 192.168.1.0 scope is full, a client can no longer get an IP address
using DHCP. If you look at the event viewer log on your computer running Windows
NT DHCP server, you will see that the server sent a NACK to itself for an
address it just tried to give out.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
