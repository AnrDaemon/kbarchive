SUMMARY
=======

When you add an interface to OSPF by Bay Networks in Routing and Remote Access
Service, the interface is not automatically OSPF enabled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you install OSPF by Bay Networks on a Routing and Remote Access Service
router, you must specify which network interface cards will be enabled for OSPF.
Perform the following steps to add a network card to the computer to use through
OSPF:

1. Right-click OSPF, and then click Add Interface.

2. Select the network adapter card you want, and then click OK. At this point,
   you must select Enable OSPF on this interface. Just clicking OK will not
   enable OSPF on the interface.
