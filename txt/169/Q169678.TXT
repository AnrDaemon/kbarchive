TITLE   :XADM: IMS and IS Use Quoted-Printable Encoding For MIME/JIS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service (IMS) and Information Store (IS)
use Quoted-Printable encoding for MIME/JIS (Japanese Industry Standards, code
set for Japanese character) configuration, but some mail readers don't support
Quoted-Printable encoding and the Japanese characters are not displayed
correctly.



MORE INFORMATION
================

Support for Quoted-Printable encoding is defined in the RFC and Microsoft
Exchange Server is supporting this correctly. However, to enable inter-
operability between Microsoft Exchange Server and mail readers that don't
support Quoted-Printable encoding, Microsoft has created the fix below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
