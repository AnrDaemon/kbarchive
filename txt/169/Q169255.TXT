TITLE   :Spooler Fails to Notify When Disk is Full
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Prior to Windows NT version 4.0, if the disk partition where the print files
were spooled ran out of space, the spooler would generate a pop-up message with
the following dialog:

   The partition is out of disk space.

With Windows NT 4.0, a warning is not generated and the document does not print.
Additionally, no entry is written to the event log.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because of changes in the design of the Windows NT 4.0 printing subsystem, the
spooler does not attempt to detect when the disk that stores the temporary spool
files runs out of space.
