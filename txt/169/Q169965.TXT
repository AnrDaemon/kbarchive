======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The first time you boot a new Toshiba 500CS, 500CDT, or 730 laptop computer, you
have the option to install Windows 3.1 or Windows 95. If you choose to install
Windows 95, Windows 95 Setup may stop responding (hang) on the first reboot.
Windows 95 Setup must reboot the computer to finish the installation.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the real-mode drivers for the Xircom IIPS PCMCIA
Ethernet card are installed on the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable the real-mode drivers by following these steps:

1. Restart the computer. Press the F8 key when you see the "Starting Windows 95"
   message, and then choose Safe Mode Command Prompt Only from the Startup menu.

2. At the command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after each
   line:

   " cd windows
   edit system.ini " (without the quotation marks)

3. Locate and disable any lines that refer to "Tranxit" in the [386enh] section
   by placing a semicolon (;) at the beginning of the line. For example, disable
   the following lines:

   " Drivers added for Tranxit
   device=c:\tranxit\<driver_name>.386 " (without the quotation marks)

4. Save and then close the System.ini file.

5. Restart your computer normally.
