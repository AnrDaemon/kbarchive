TITLE   :FIX: Breakpoints Not Allowed on Certain Valid SQL Statements
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbDebug kbEEdition kbSQL kbVC420bug kbVC500fix kbSQLProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to debug stored procedures, you may run into problems when setting
breakpoints on the following valid SQL commands.

   BEGIN TRANSACTION
   COMMIT TRANSACTION
   ROLLBACK TRANSACTION
   SAVE TRANSACTION

CAUSE
=====

The SQL debugger's lexer, or command parser, does not recognize the commands
listed above.

RESOLUTION
==========

The problem has been fixed in Microsoft Visual C++, Enterprise Edition, version
5.0. All the keywords listed except BEGIN are valid lines for breakpoints. BEGIN
is not valid because it can be used to delimit WHILE loops and other multi-line
SQL statements.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Microsoft Visual C++, Enterprise
Edition, version 4.2. This bug has been corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
Enterprise Edition, version 5.0.
