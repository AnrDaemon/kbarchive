TITLE   :XADM: POP3 Users may not Receive an Attachment if Part of DL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Custom recipients (CRs) that are members of Microsoft Exchange Distribution
Lists (DLs) and use POP3 clients, may not receive attachments when messages are
sent to the DL.

CCMAIL users who are SMTP custom recipients may receive the attachment as a
base64 file called Mime6.raw.

CAUSE
=====

When the DL is created, the default property for the DL is to Allow Rich Text
and this is inherited by all members of this DL.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The property to Allow Rich Text is set for Microsoft Exchange Recipients and DLs
automatically. This property is not set for CR. However, if the CR is part of a
DL, the CR inherits this property from the DL as it is expanded. With this Allow
Rich Text property set, the IMS will send out message with Transport Neutral
Encoding Format (TNEF) attachments and most POP3 clients cannot read this
format.
