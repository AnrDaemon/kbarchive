The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Linkage Connector to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.2 
 - LinkAge Message Exchange, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

LinkAge Connectors use the MAPI Personal Address Book service for storing any
required temporary proxy addresses. These are stored under

   C:\LINKAGE\TABLES\*.PAB

or wherever the root is.

When you upgrade or re-install, it is important that these .pab files do not get
deleted if you do not want to lose any previously generated temporary proxy
addresses. You should also back these files up from time to time.

A Personal Address Book (PAB) is created for each of the Linkage connectors. This
is because, in theory, certain addresses such as X.400 addresses for a Sender or
Passive Recipient, can exceed the capacity of cc:Mail and Notes to directly
represent them and therefore may require a map through the Exchange PAB.
However, in practice, this seldom happens.
