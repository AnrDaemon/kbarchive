TITLE   :Remote Session Manager Unavailable When Installing TelnetD
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Telnet Server service does not install properly as described in the
Telnet.wri documentation. The instructions are to select the Remote Session
Manager when adding the Telnet service. However, the only selection available is
Telnet Service Beta (Inbound Telnet).

If you install TelnetD without installing the Remote Session Manager, clients
attempting to connect to the server through Telnet will receive a "Connection
Failed" error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue has been addressed in an updated Oemsetup.inf file for the TelnetD
service.

To obtain a copy of the latest Oemsetup.inf file for the Telnet Server:

 - Connect to the following ftp site:

   ftp://ntrk.microsoft.com/telnet_beta/beta.10/

   -or-

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt40/

NOTE: You can also obtain the Oemsetup.inf file from the Windows NT 4.0 Resource
Kit Supplement 4 in case the FTP site is unavailable.

 - Download Oemsetup.inf directly into your current Resource Kit Telnet
   directory. This is typically C:\Reskit\Telnet.

 - Follow the directions in the Telnet.wri file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Telnet Server has two components: the service itself (Telnetd.exe), and an
underlying component--the Remote Session Manager (Rsm.exe). The Telnet Server
service operates by connecting to the Remote Session Manager (RSM) component.

RSM is responsible for initiating, terminating, and managing the character-
oriented remote Telnet session on a given system. RSM only affects the services
provided in the Telnet Server service; it does not affect Microsoft Remote
Access Service (RAS) or other layered products.
