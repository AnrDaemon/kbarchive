TITLE   :Error 127 Starting Dial Up Networking After Running Copyadmn.cm
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run Copyadmn.cmd on a computer with Remote Access Service (RAS)
installed, you will receive the error:

   Cannot load the Remote Access Connection Manager service. Error 127: The
   specified procedure could not be found.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

To restore RAS functionality, expand the following DLLs from the Windows NT
CD-ROM to your %SystemRoot%\System32 directory. After expanding the files,
reapply your current service pack and restart your computer.

Expand the following files to your system32 directory:

   Rasdlg.dl_
   Rasapi32.dl_
   Rasfil32.dl_
   Rasscrpt.dl_

Example: expand D:\i386\Rasdlg.dl_ C:\Winnt\System32\Rasdlg.dll

MORE INFORMATION
================

Copyadmn.cmd is a command file that copies the files needed to run the Routing
and RAS Admin (Mpradmin.exe) tool on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT
version 4.0 Workstation or Server. This utility is intended for Windows NT
computers that do not have Routing and RAS Admin or legacy Windows NT 4.0 RAS
installed. If Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) is installed, this tool
is already available by default. If legacy Windows NT 4.0 RAS is installed,
there will be incompatibilities with DLL files and RAS will not function. The
Routing and RAS Admin tool and 4.0 RAS cannot run on the same computer.
