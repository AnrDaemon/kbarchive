SUMMARY
=======

If you create a subfolder for a top-level public folder that resides on another
Exchange Server computer, the content of that subfolder will be replicated to
the Exchange Server computer with the top-level folder. However, your home
public folder server (which is specified in Public Folder Server on the General
Tab of the Private Information Store Properties dialogue box) still keeps a copy
of the subfolder for a period of time; this copy will be deleted eventually.


Additional query words: resources replica
