 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194470.

SYMPTOMS
========

During FrontPage Setup, you receive a message indicating that you do not have
sufficient disk space. Specifically, the disk space required may be only
slightly more--about 2 to 4 megabytes (MB)--than what you have available.

CAUSE
=====

The FrontPage Setup program sets aside some extra buffer space in its
calculation of required disk space. This allows FrontPage Setup to reserve space
for temporary files that are required during Setup. The FrontPage Setup program
also reserves extra space because some larger hard disks use a larger cluster
size that requires more physical space to store the same amount of data as a
hard disk with a smaller cluster size.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, make sure you have at least 2 to 4 MB of additional
free hard disk space than indicated by the FrontPage Setup program.
