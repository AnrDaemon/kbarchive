TITLE   :Multihomed DNS Server May Fail Recursive Queries
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may not be able to reliably resolve recursive queries from your Windows NT
Server Domain Name Service (DNS) server when all of the following conditions is
true:

 - Your DNS Server is multihomed, having multiple IP interfaces.

 - DNS is not bound to all of the adapters in the computer.

 - The adapters in the DNS server are connected to disjoint network segments.

CAUSE
=====

The DNS server cannot consistently choose which network adapter to send and
receive queries on under this configuration. DNS may either try to send on an
adapter that does not have DNS bound to it or try to send packets on an adapter
not reachable by the querying DNS client hosts.


RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that DNS is bound to all adapters in your multihomed computer.

Additional query words: recursion unresolved name query multi-homed
