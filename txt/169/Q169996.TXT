SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an ISAPI DLL as an #exec server-side include, the ISAPI DLL does
not run.

CAUSE
=====

The following line in the HTML document has been written with an ISA statement:

      <!--#exec isa ="/scripts/w3test.dll?SimulatePendingIO"-->

The above is the stated method in the documentation. However, this is incorrect.

WORKAROUND
==========

Write the #exec line with a CGI statement as stated in the sample below:

      <!--#exec cgi ="/scripts/w3test.dll?SimulatePendingIO"-->
