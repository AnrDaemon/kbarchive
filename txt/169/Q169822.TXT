TITLE   :DSMN RAS Dial-in Properties Deletes NetWare Compatibility
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use User Manager for Domains to add, change, or view the dial-in
properties of a Novell NetWare-compatible user, click OK to close the dial-in
dialog box, and then click OK to close the user's Properties window, a dialog
box appears requesting a password for the NetWare- compatible user. If you click
Cancel in this dialog box, the NetWare Compatibility box is cleared for that
user. In the case of Directory Services Manager for NetWare (DSMN), the user is
deleted from all NetWare servers that are being managed. In the case of File and
Print Services for NetWare (FPNW), the user cannot log on using a NetWare
client.

NOTE: This hotfix should also be applied to the following:

 - Any computer running Windows NT Server Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or
   Backup Domain Controller (BDC) that is using User Manager for Domains to
   modify user accounts.

 - Any computer running Windows NT Workstation on which the DSMN Administration
   Tools are installed.

CAUSE
=====

Rassapi.dll incorrectly updates the user information.
