SYMPTOMS
========

The Visual Basic OLE Container Control has an AutoActivate property that enables
a user to activate an OLE object in different ways. Setting this property to "1
- GetFocus" does not automatically activate the application that provides the
OLE object when the OLE container control receives the focus.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this bug, code needs to be added to the OLE Container Control's
GotFocus event to automatically activate the application that provides the OLE
object when the control receives the focus. The following code makes the OLE
Container Control behave as though its AutoActivate property were set to "1 -
GotFocus":

      Private Sub OLE1_GotFocus()
         OLE1.DoVerb (vbOLEShow)
      End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is added by default.

2. Add an OLE Container control (OLE1) to Form1 and add any OLE Object to the
   container control.

3. Set the OLE Container control's AutoActivate property to "1 - GetFocus."

4. Press the F5 key to run the program. When the OLE Container control receives
   focus it will not AutoActivate.

To see the behavior that should occur when the OLE Container control receives the
focus, change the AutoActivate property to "2 - DoubleClick" and run the form or
implement the workaround provided above.
