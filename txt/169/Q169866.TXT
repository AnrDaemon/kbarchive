SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit, incorrectly states on pages 596 and 599,
that "redlining is converted to comments."

MORE INFORMATION
================

Redlining format from WordPerfect versions 5.x and 6.x is actually converted
into inserted text revision marking.

Redline is a font format that WordPerfect uses to designate text that has changed
or that was inserted during the document review process. The converters that
Microsoft Word uses to import WordPerfect 5.x and 6.x documents change any
WordPerfect redline format to inserted text revision marking.
