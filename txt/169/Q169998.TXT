TITLE   :XCON: ISOCOR MTA Does Not Accept BP15 Attachments
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When sending a message from a Microsoft Exchange Server system to an ISOCOR
message transfer agent (MTA), the ISOCOR system's client, when opening the
message, may encounter the following error:

   Error decoding folder INTRAY; invalid length

After closing the error message, the contents of the message will appear.
However, the attachment will be missing.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because the ISOCOR system does not support the use of Body
Part 15 (BP15)-type attachments.

RESOLUTION
==========

To solve this problem, go into the Exchange Server Administrator program and
open the properties page for the X.400 connection to the ISOCOR system. Go to
the Advanced tab and in the X.400 Link Options section, click to clear the
"Allow BP15" checkbox. Restart the MTA service and send the message again. This
behavior is by product design.
