To resolve this problem:

 - Apply the latest LinkAge Message Exchange version 3.2 patch. This problem was
   fixed in patch version 070723(the latest patch is cumulative). The readme

   The "Convert Exchange to Notes" process can now handle Exchange Server
   messages without any RTF body part. The process previously restarted when it
