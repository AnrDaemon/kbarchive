TITLE   :XCLN: Unable to Drag and Drop Attachment in Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running Windows 95 and have Symantec Corporation's Norton AntiVirus 2
installed, you might not be able to drag and drop an attachment to a message in
your Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client to your desktop or any other
location. You will see the mouse pointer change to a no symbol, a circle with
diagonal line. You can save the attachment using any other Save option.

WORKAROUND
==========

If Norton Scheduler loads from the StartUp group and runs Norton AntiVirus 2,
Norton AntiVirus 2 will remain in memory as a Terminate and Stay Resident
program (TSR). If you start Norton Scheduler after startup, Norton AntiVirus 2
will run as an on-demand application and this problem will not occur. To remove
Norton Scheduler from the StartUp group, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the Windows 95 task bar and click Properties.

2. Click the Start Menu Programs tab.

3. Click the Advanced... button.

4. Expand Programs in the left-pane and click StartUp.

5. In the right-pane, select Norton Scheduler and drag it to your desktop.

STATUS
======

Microsoft and Symantec Corporation have confirmed this to be a problem in the
Norton AntiVirus program for Windows 95, version 2.01. Please contact Symantec
Corporation for any new releases or fixes.
