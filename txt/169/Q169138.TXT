TITLE   :Network Connections Are Deferred
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.2,3.11,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdomain

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

By default, persistent drive connections are deferred in Windows NT 4.0. These
deferred connections are sometimes referred to as ghosted. If you type net use
from the command prompt, the drive status shows disconnected. Setting focus to
the drive changes the drive mapping status to OK and initiates a connection with
the server. However, you will experience the following error when using Windows
NT Explorer to access a deferred mapping to a share-level server or user-level
server that requires a password other than that of the currently logged on
user:

   D:\ is not accessible.

   Logon failure: unknown username or password.

CAUSE
=====

The DeferFlags registry entry is not set to 1.

This registry value should be added when making a persistent drive mapping to a
server that requires specifying a password before connecting:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Network\D   (where D represents the drive mapping)

Valuename:  DeferFlags
Datatype:   REG_DWORD
Value:      1

For additional information on ghosted connections, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
