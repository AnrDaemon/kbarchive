To prevent the Office Assistant prompt you each time you save a document in a
format other than Word 97, you need to create three Visual Basic for
Applications macros. Name each macro as follows:

   FileSave, FileSaveAs, and Save_SaveAs

then type the following example Visual Basic for Applications code into each
respective macro:

      Sub FileSave()
         ' If the document has not been saved
         ' display the File SaveAs dialog.
         If ActiveDocument.Saved = False Then
            ' Call the Save_SaveAs macro.
            Save_SaveAs
         Else
            ' Otherwise, save the document.
            ActiveDocument.Save
         End If
      End Sub

      Sub FileSaveAs()
         ' Call the Save_SaveAs macro.
         Save_SaveAs
      End Sub

      Public Sub Save_SaveAs()

         ' **********************************************
         ' This macro replaces the default functionality
         ' of the FileSaveAs command.
         ' **********************************************
         Dim myDialog As Dialog
         Set myDialog = Dialogs(wdDialogFileSaveAs)
         ' Display the Dialog and save the document.
         If myDialog.Display Then
            ActiveDocument.SaveAs myDialog.Name, myDialog.Format, _
            myDialog.LockAnnot, myDialog.Password, myDialog.AddToMru, _
            myDialog.WritePassword, myDialog.RecommendReadOnly, _
            myDialog.EmbedFonts, myDialog.NativePictureFormat, _
            myDialog.FormsData, myDialog.SaveAsAOCELetter
         End If
      End Sub
