TITLE   :XFOR: MS Mail Connector Interchange Rejects Outlook Msgs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you send an Outlook message with a category selected to a Microsoft Mail 3.5
recipient, the message will be rejected immediately by the Microsoft Mail
Connector interchange (MSMI). You receive a non-delivery report (NDR) with the
error message:

   MS Mail Connector failed parsing the message content.

CAUSE
=====

Outlook send-forms with a category selected contain named properties. These
named properties have not been recognized properly by the MSMI. As a result the
MSMI generated NDRs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Do not use categories when sending messages to Microsoft Mail users.

STATUS
======

version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
