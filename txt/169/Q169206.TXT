TITLE   :Using TRACERT With the Loose Source Routing Option

SUMMARY
=======

The Tracert command-line utility can be used to find the route that IP datagrams
travel from one system to another. You can run this utitily by typing tracert
<ipaddr> or tracert <hostname>.

However, it can also be used with the -j flag to find the route used to get from
any specific router IP address to another IP address.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Usage: tracert [-d] [-h maximum_hops] [-j host-list] [-w timeout] target_name

Options:

   -d                 Do not resolve addresses to hostnames.
   -h maximum_hops    Maximum number of hops to search for target.
   -j host-list       Loose source route along host-list.
   -w timeout         Wait timeout milliseconds for each reply.

The -j option can be used to force the outbound datagram to pass through a
specific router, by using the IP source route option. For example, if you type
tracert hosta, and find that the path used is as follows:

* router1
* router2
* router3
* router4
* hosta

You can find the path to router4 and back to your computer, by typing tracert -j
router4 <mycomputer>.

The route to router4 and back to your computer will be traced. In this example,
it would probably be:

* router1
* router2
* router3
* router4
* router3
* router2
* router1
* <mycomputer>
