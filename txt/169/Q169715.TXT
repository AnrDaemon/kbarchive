PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a message is submitted for delivery, the Microsoft Exchange Server message
transfer agent (MTA) may generate the following Event ID in the Application
Event Log:

   MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 208
   Type: Warning
   Category: Security
   The default latest delivery time for the message C=US;AMD;P=PRMD;L= has
   expired (10080 minutes after a submission). A non-delivery report has
   been generated with reason code unable-to-transfer and diagnostic code
   maximum-time-expired. [MTA XFER-IN 17 358] (14)

You may also notice the following events appearing in the application event log
intermittently:

   Event ID:  208
   Source:  MSExchangeMTA
   Type:  Warning
   Category:  Security
   Description:  The default latest delivery time for message
   C=US;A=ATTMAIL;P=ACMECORP;L=SEATTLE-EXCHANGE-00065E89 has expired
   (10080 minutes after submission). A non-delivery report has been
   generated with reason code Unable to Transfer and diagnostic code
   MAX TIME EXPIRED. [MTA XFER-I 23 358] (14)

   Event ID:  290
   Source MSExchangeMTA
   Type:  Warning
   Category:  X.400 Service
   Description:  A non-delivery report (reason code unable-to-transfer
   and diagnostic code maximum-time-expired) is being generated for
   message C=US;A=ATTMAIL;P=ACMECORP;L=SEATTLE-EXCHANGE-00065E89. It
   was originally destined for DN:/o=ACMECORP/ou=SEATTLE/cn=MS Mail
   Addresses/n=SMTP: arnold.schwarzeneggar@acmecorp.com 2F52A9AC[ASCII 167]
   (recipient number 1), and was to be redirected to . [MTA DISP:ROUTER
   14 136] <12)

In a large organization, this may be the only existing evidence that a message is
generating a non-delivery report.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Event ID is generated for messages immediately following their
submission, it is usually an indication that one or more of the servers involved
has an incorrect system date or time setting.

Using Message Tracking and the Message ID reported in Event 208 (namely
C=US;A=ATTMAIL;P=ACMECORP;L=SEATTLE-EXCHANGE-00065E89), it is possible to
determine the originator of the message. In one case, it was discovered that the
computer DATE on the Sender's computer was set one year off (1996 instead of
1997). Hence, when messages arrived at the Exchange Server MTA for routing and
delivery, the MTA compared the message date stamp (generated at the originating
system) to the local system date setting for the Exchange Server MTA, and
determined that the maximum time for delivery had expired.

WORKAROUND
==========

Verify that the date and time settings are set appropriately for each server and
computer involved in message submission and delivery.
