SUMMARY
=======

You can use Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) to manipulate file shares
as shown in the Visual Basic sample code below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You must install the ADSI runtime (ADS.EXE) available from
www.microsoft.com/ntserver/info/adsi.htm, and then add a reference to Active DS
Type Library.

Note: Windows 2000 includes the ADSI 2.5 run time. Installation of the above
runtime is not required.

The following code first gets a fileshare object on a server and reads its path
property. Then it gets a fileservice object on a server, uses it to enumerate
the shares on the server, creates a new share \\SERVER\newshare for C:\, and
deletes the share it just created. You can omit the DOMAIN\ in the code below,
but you may see some performance degradation caused by additional browsing to
find the SERVER:

      Sub foo()

      Dim comp As IADsComputer
      Dim serv As IADsService
      Dim fserv As IADsContainer
      Dim share As IADsFileShare
      Dim shareNew As IADsFileShare
      Dim v As Variant

      ' Replace DOMAIN, SERVER & SHARE with the appropriate
      ' domain, server  and share names
      Set share = GetObject("WinNT://DOMAIN/SERVER/lanmanserver/SHARE")
      v = share.Path ' Gets directory path on server
      Set share = nothing

      ' Replace DOMAIN & SERVER with the appropriate domain and server names
      Set fserv = GetObject("WinNT://DOMAIN/SERVER/lanmanserver")

      ' Enumerate existing shares
      For Each share In fserv
        v = share.Class
        v = share.ADsPath
        v = share.HostComputer
        v = share.Path
      Next share

      ' Create share in fileservice container
      Set shareNew = fserv.Create("fileshare", "newshare")
      shareNew.Path = "C:\"
      shareNew.SetInfo  ' Commit new share

      ' Delete share
      fserv.Delete "fileshare", "newshare"

      ' Fails since share is gone
      shareNew.GetInfo

      End Sub
