TITLE   :PRB: Setup Wizard Displays "Invalid command-line parameters"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows

KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool kbVBp500 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing an application using a setup program created with the Microsoft
Visual Basic 5.0 Setup Wizard or Setup Toolkit, the following message appears:

   Invalid command-line parameters. Unable to continue.

CAUSE
=====

When an application's setup program is run from a network drive, the full
server, share, and folder names for the setup folder are parsed. If the setup
program's folder name contains a dash (-) or a space, it is perceived by the
setup program as a command-line parameter. For example, if an application is
being installed from the server\share\folder location:

   \\server1\share1\folder-1

the dash is mistakenly perceived as a command-line parameter for the setup
program when the path is parsed. In this example, -1 is not a valid command-
line parameter and the message above is displayed.

This message is not displayed if the application's setup program is run from the
local hard drive or from floppy disks.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the application's setup program from a folder that does not have a dash or a
space in the name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
