PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to log on to your Exchange mailbox via Active Server Pages, you may
receive the following error message:

   Error: Access is Denied.

CAUSE
=====

You have a proxy server in your environment and your browser's proxy settings
are set to use the proxy server for all requests. This causes the IIS server to
request for authorization at the Exchange Login page and it fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

Enable the "Do not use proxy server for local (Intranet) addresses" option in
Internet Explorer:

1. View the Internet Explorer Properties. This can be reached in the following
   ways:

    - Go to Control Panel and double-click on Internet

    - Right-click the Internet Explorer icon on the desktop.

    - In Internet Explorer, on the View menu, click Options.

2. Click the Connection tab; if there is a Settings button , click it.

3. Select the "Do not use proxy server for local (intranet) addresses" check
   box.
