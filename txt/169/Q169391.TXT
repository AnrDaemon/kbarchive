CAUSE
=====

These problems may occur for any of the following reasons:

 - Setupapi.dll is corrupted.

 - Setupapi.dll was replaced by a third-party version and is not functioning
   properly with Windows NT.

 - The Plug and Play service is not set to an automatic startup type.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the appropriate method:

Expand Setupapi.dll File
------------------------

Expand the Setupapi.dll file from the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM. To do so:

1. Make sure Control Panel is closed.

2. In Windows NT Explorer or My Computer, rename Setupapi.dll to Setupapi.old.
   Setupapi.dll is in the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder.

3. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click Command Prompt.

4. Go to the i386 folder on the Windows NT 4.0 compact disc.

5. Type the following command to expand the compressed .dll file:

   expand setupapi.dl_ %SystemRoot%\system32\setupapi.dll


Configure the Plug and Play Service to an Automatic Startup Type
----------------------------------------------------------------

To do so, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Services.

2. Click the Plug And Play service, and verify that the Status is Started, and
   that the Startup is Automatic. If they are not, configure them appropriately,
   and then click OK.
