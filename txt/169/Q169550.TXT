TITLE   :Windows 95 Clock Loses Time with APM Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enable Advanced Power Management (APM) on a computer running Windows
95, the Windows 95 clock may slow down or stop when the computer switches to
suspended mode. However, the system clock continues to keep the correct time and
you can reset the Windows 95 clock to the correct time by restarting the
computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions exists:

 - You enabled APM in the computer's CMOS settings after Windows 95 was
   installed.

 - Your computer's BIOS supports an older version of APM.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method.

Enabled APM After Installing Windows 95
---------------------------------------

If you enabled APM in your computer's CMOS settings after installing Windows 95,
Windows 95 APM support may not have been installed. Reinstall Windows 95 to
install APM support.

To verify that APM support is enabled, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

2. On the Device Manager tab, double-click the System Devices branch to expand
   it.

3. Double-click Advanced Power Management Support.

4. On the Settings tab, verify that the Enable Power Management Support check
   box is selected.

APM Support Is Installed
------------------------

If APM support is installed, suspend the computer by clicking the Start button
and then clicking Suspend before the computer switches to suspended mode.

Computer's BIOS Supports an Older Version of APM
------------------------------------------------

You may be able to resolve this issue by upgrading the computer's BIOS. Contact
the computer's manufacturer for information about a possible BIOS upgrade.
