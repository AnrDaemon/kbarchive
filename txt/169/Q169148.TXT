TITLE   :XFOR: GroupWise Migration Fails with Shared Directory WPC20 Err
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty exc4 exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Server Migration wizard to migrate GroupWise
mailboxes, the following error message may appear:

   Microsoft Exchange Server Migration Wizard

   GroupWise Shared Directory "WPC20" not specified in the Registry. Cannot
   continue with the GroupWise Migration.

This error occurs when you select Migrate from Novell GroupWise in the Migration
Wizard.

CAUSE
=====

The Novell GroupWise 4.1 Windows client is not installed or the GroupWise Shared
Code is not registered correctly on the computer you are running the migration
from. The GroupWise Shared code is registered in the HKEY_ROOT\WpConfig\SHWin2x
registry key. If the key is not present, or the information is invalid, you will
need to re-install the GroupWise client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - Install or re-install the Novell GroupWise 4.1 client. This will install and
   register the GroupWise Shared Code.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Exchange Server GroupWise Migration utility uses the GroupWise client to
access the GroupWise post office. Currently, only GroupWise 4.1 post offices can
be migrated.

GroupWise is manufactured by Novell, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make
no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
