TITLE   :XCLN: Exchange Client Won't Register for New Mail Notification
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0; WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Neither the Microsoft Exchange Client 4.0 or later, nor the Microsoft Outlook 97
client will register for new mail notifications on non-default message stores.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The only way either of the above-mentioned clients will register for new mail
notifications for a specific message store is if the message store advertises to
the messaging subsystem that it can be a default store. These clients will only
register for new mail notifications with the message store that is listed as the
default message store in the current profile. These clients will not register
for new mail notifications in any other message store other than the default
message store in the same profile in a given session.

If you have two message store providers listed in a given profile, one, and only
one, can be the default message store. For any session that uses this profile,
the Exchange and Outlook clients will register only with the default message
store listed in the profile for new mail notifications. Any other message stores
in the profile are ignored for new mail notification.
