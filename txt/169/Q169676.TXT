TITLE   :XCON: DirRep Messages NDR Due to Connector Restrictions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to submit Directory Replication (DSA) messages between Microsoft
Exchange Sites where a delivery restriction (limiting size or
accepting/rejecting messages from specific sender addresses) is configured for
the connector, DSA messages may be rejected with the following Event ID in the
Windows NT Event Viewer Application log:

   MSExchangeMTA
   Event ID: 290
   A non-delivery report (reason code restricted-delivery and diagnostic
   code Omit any diagnostic code) is being generated for message.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 applies any configured connector
restrictions to system messages such as DSA and Public Folder Replication
messages. System messages such as those described should be exempt from any
existing delivery restrictions which may exist for a configured connector.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
