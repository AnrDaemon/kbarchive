MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Command window, type following commands:

   SET DATE to Taiwan
   SET CENTURY OFF
   *** Note : Year 2000 is equivalent to Taiwan Year 0089
   ? {^2000-01-01}

   "89/01/01" displays on the FoxPro desktop (or in the active window).

2. Place the same setting within a text box of a form and set the "Readonly"
   property to .F. The result is "0089/01/01."

3. Add a TextBox control within a form.

4. Change the property "Century" of the TextBox to "0 - Off."

5. Change the property "DateFormat" to "8 - Taiwan."

6. Change the "value" of the TextBox to {^2000-01-01}, which is January 1, 2000,
   and run the form.

NOTE: The display of the TextBox will be "0089/01/01." The TextBox value,
however, is "89/01/01."
