 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS

Canceling an installation of Routing and Remote Access Service can cause
problems with the legacy Windows NT Server 4.0 Remote Access.

CAUSE

When you cancel an installation of Routing and Remote Access, the original
Oemnsvra.inf file does not get restored. This can cause problems in binding or
updating of legacy Windows NT 4.0 RAS components.

Copy and expand the original Oemnsvra.inf file from the Windows NT Server CD
into the %SystemRoot%\System32 directory.

STATUS
======

Service Update. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
