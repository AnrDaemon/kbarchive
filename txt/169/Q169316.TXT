SUMMARY
=======

This article tells you how to install WAN services for Eicon on Windows NT
Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To Install WAN Services for Eicon on Windows NT Server 3.51:

1. Get the WAN Services for Eicon from the Eicon CD.

2. Make sure to apply the appropriate service packs after adding the software.
   Refer to Eicon documentation on how to install the WAN Services. The WAN
   Services for Eicon must be V3R4b.

To install WAN Services for Eicon on Windows NT 4.0:

1. Install the EICON WAN Services for Windows NT from the Windows NT 4.0 CD. The
   WAN Services for Eicon must be V3R4b.

2. Exchange Server also requires the X.25 NLD Toolkit for Windows NT 1.3b Build
   105 (X25ntm9.dll). This file is installed by Exchange Server Setup under
   Exchsrvr\Bin and Exchsrvr\Connect\Msmcon\Bin.

In order for Exchange Server to perform correctly you must be running the correct
version of WAN Services for NT. If the EICON X.25 service fails to start this is
probably a driver version issue. If the EICON service starts but no messages are
received it could be an EICON/Exchange configuration issue.
