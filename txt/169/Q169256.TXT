KEYWORDS:kbdisplay kbfield word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you scroll through your document, some of the text may seem to disappear.
Turning on field codes for viewing by pressing ALT+F9 allows you to see all of
the text.

CAUSE
=====

You may have an ADVANCE field in your document. To view the field, turn on field
codes for viewing by pressing ALT+F9.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the following steps to remove the ADVANCE field
from the document:

1. Turn on field codes for viewing by pressing ALT+F9.

2. On the Edit menu, click Replace.

3. Click in the Find What box and then click More.

4. Click the Special tab and then click Field.

   The Find What box will contain the text "^d."

5. Press the SPACEBAR once and then type "advance" (without the quotation
   marks).

6. Leave the Replace With box blank.

7. Click Find Next, and then click either Replace or Replace All.

To adjust text placement, try using the Font, Paragraph, or Tabs command (on the
Format menu) instead of using the Advance field.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

ADVANCE fields first appeared in Microsoft Word 6.0 and will most commonly
appear in documents that are converted from WordPerfect to Microsoft Word. When
field codes on are turned on for viewing, this field would appear as follows

   {ADVANCE [Switches ]}

The ADVANCE field offsets the starting point of text that follows the ADVANCE
field to the right or left, up or down, or to a specific horizontal or vertical
position.
