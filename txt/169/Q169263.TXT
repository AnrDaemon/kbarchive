PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the passwords in User Manager and Internet Server Manager are not identical,
you will get the following error message:

   HTTP 1.0 Server 500 Error: The referenced account is currently
   locked out and may not be logged onto.

CAUSE
=====

If in User Manager, under account policies, the Account Lockout security feature
has been selected, and the passwords for the anonymous Internet account
(IUSR_machine-name, by default) are different in User Manager and Internet
Service Manager, then when you establish an anonymous connection, you will get
an incomplete header message returned the first time. On subsequent login
attempts, you will get the following error message:

   Server 500 error: THE REFERENCED ACCOUNT IS CURRENTLY LOCKED OUT
   AND MAY NOT BE LOGGED ONTO.

This occurs because IUSR tried to log onto the server with an incorrect password.
After x attempts (where x is defined in User Manager, Policies, Account, Lockout
after x bad login attempts), the account becomes locked out.

WORKAROUND
==========

To restore this account, you must first go into User Manager, open the
properties for the account, and clear the check box in the account locked out
check box. Next, you must change the passwords in User Manager and Internet
Server Manager making sure that they are identical.
