KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsmsUtil smsutil

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using RSERVICE to install the Package Command Manager (PCM) service for
client computers running Windows NT, you may receive the following error:

   Cannot install service SMS_PACKAGE_COMMAND_MANAGER_NT on
   <COMPUTERNAME>!
   [Error 203. The system could not find the environment option that was
   entered.]

WORKAROUND
==========

The service is installed correctly; however, when the /deinstall option is used,
the service is not removed. Therefore, you can remove pcmsvc by using instsrv or
instsvc from the Windows NT Resource Kit.

STATUS
======

version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
