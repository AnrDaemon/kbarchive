======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, version 2.65 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG #: 16924 (SQL)

SYMPTOMS
========

The SQL Server ODBC driver may generate an access violation (AV) error if an
application is inserting data from a remote stored procedure that contains ORDER
BY clause. The access violation occurs when the application calls SQLExecDirect
or SQLPrepare/SQLExecute to execute the INSERT statement.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC
driver version 2.65. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the ORDER BY clause from the remote stored
procedure.
