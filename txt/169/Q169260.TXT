PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There are no command line equivalents for "Create Site Map" or "Check
Hyperlinks". These features are only available through the Web menu in the
Visual SourceSafe Explorer after you have designated a project as a Web
Project.

Deploy is the only command available in both the Visual SourceSafe Explorer and
the Command Line.

Syntax:

   ss Deploy Project Path

You must have the Read access right to use this command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To specify a project as a Web Project in Visual SourceSafe, do the following:

1. From the SourceSafe Administrator, select Tools and then Options.

2. Click the Web Projects tab. This tab contains five text fields. The first
   field (called "This Project Represents a Web Site") and either or both of the
   next two fields (called "URL" and "Virtual Root") must be filled in before
   you can designate a project as a Web Project.

   NOTE: For more information on how to designate a project as a Web Project, see
   page 173 of the User's Guide for Visual SourceSafe 5.0.

3. After you have specified a project as a Web project from within the
   Administrator, restart the Visual SourceSafe Explorer. Now you will see the
   Web glyph on the project you designated as a Web project.

4. Select the project. The Deploy, Check Hyperlinks, and Create Site Map
   commands are now active in the Web menu.
