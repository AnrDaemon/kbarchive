TITLE   :MDG: Offline Symbol Caused by Corrupted Mailbag
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.2,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The offline (or net disconnect) symbol may appear in the status bar of Microsoft
Mail for Windows for one or more mailboxes. This results in being unable to send
or receive messages. However, if you log on with the same mailbox from the
MS-DOS mail program, there does not seem to be a problem.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused if:

 - The user's MMF file resides on a Novell file server and is in an ownerless
   state.

 - The user's KEY and MBG files are corrupted or are not accessible.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - Ensure that all files on a postoffice that resides on a Novell file server
   have an owner.

 - Use the Mailq16.exe utility that ships in the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
   Resource Kit to reset or rebuild the KEY and MBG files for the user.
