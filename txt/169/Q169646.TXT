TITLE   :XADM: Simeon 4.1.1 Does Not Support Multipart/Related Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


The Simeon Mail client version 4.1.1 does not support multipart/related messages
delivered by an Exchange Server computer. The Simeon user will see a message
indicating that this will be supported in a future release.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

Administrators of Exchange Server should configure the mailbox of a Simeon user
for plain text:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, bring up the mailbox of the
   Simeon client user and select the Protocols tab.

2. Select IMAP4 (Mail) and clear the from "Use Protocol Defaults" check box.
   Under MIME Encoding, select the "Provide Message Body as Plain Text" check
   box

When future versions of Simeon support multipart/related messages, these settings
can be changed.
