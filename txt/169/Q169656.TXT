SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Message Transfer Agent (MTA) may fail to start.
The following error will be logged in the Windows NT Application Log:

   Event ID 2143 MSExchangeMTA
   Internal Processing
   A fatal MTA database server error was encountered. Call Microsoft
   Product Support.

Running MTACHECK will produce no errors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem usually occurs on high use systems that participate is Directory
Synchronization (DXA) with Microsoft Mail PO's. The issue is the DXA is serviced
by an MTA queue that is also used for handling message reports. Whenever a
report is handled by the MTA; the queue is reset. If the DXA was in the process
of reading or writing into the queue at the time of the reset, the APDU
(Application Packet Data Unit) becomes correct and this causes the problem
