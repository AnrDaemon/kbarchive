PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbother kbusage winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a mail merge to electronic fax using Microsoft Fax or some
other fax software, a cover page is not sent with each fax.

CAUSE
=====

Your fax software is not set up to send a cover page.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before you perform the mail merge in Word, turn on the cover page option in your
fax software. See your fax software documentation for instructions about how to
do this.

If you are using Microsoft Fax, use these steps to select the Send Cover Page
option:

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Mail And Fax icon.

3. On the Services tab, click Microsoft Fax, and then click Properties.

4. On the Message tab, under Default Cover Page, click to select the Send Cover
   Page check box, and then click OK.

   NOTE: You can select which cover page you want to include with your fax.

5. Click OK to close the Properties dialog box.

STATUS
======

This functionality is by design. Microsoft Word cannot provide a cover sheet
when you perform a mail merge. Microsoft Fax, or any other fax software, must
provide the fax cover sheet.
