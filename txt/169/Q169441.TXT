======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Human Body for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to print the driver's license from Magic School Bus Explores
the Human Body to a Hewlett Packard (HP) DeskJet printer, the program may become
minimized or seem to disappear.

CAUSE
=====

The Magic School Bus (MSB) Human Body and the HP DeskJet Status Monitor are
running on your computer at the same time and competing for the same resources
in Windows 95. The HP DeskJet Status Monitor software is installed when you
install your DeskJet's printer driver.

When you try to print a driver's license, MSB Human Body must minimize because
the HP DeskJet Status Monitor software begins running. MSB Human Body is still
running, but it has been minimized and moved to the taskbar.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the two methods outlined below.

Method 1: Maximize MSB Human Body
---------------------------------

1. Locate the taskbar; it is the strip that contains the START button and is
   usually found running across the bottom of the your Windows 95 desktop.

2. Locate the MSB HUMAN BODY button on the taskbar and click it once to activate
   it.

3. The MSB Human Body program should now be running at normal size on your
   desktop. You will need to repeat these steps each time you want to print from
   the driver's license screen.

Method 2: Remove the HP DeskJet Status Monitor
----------------------------------------------

1. Use the right mouse button to click the taskbar and then click Properties on
   the menu that appears.

2. On the Start Menu Programs tab, click the Remove button.

3. Click the plus sign (+) to the left of the Startup folder to expand the
   branch.

4. Select the HP DeskJet Status Monitor shortcut and then click the Remove
   button.

5. Click Close.

6. Restart your computer.

With the HP DeskJet Status Monitor disabled, your DeskJet printer will still
print, but MSB Human Body will no longer be minimized.
