TITLE   :INFO: Actions That Perform an Implicit GET

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Certain SourceSafe operations by default implicitly GET a local copy of a file.
This is partially documented in the Online Help for the -G command line option

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following commands perform a GET when they are executed from the command
line or the Visual SourceSafe Explorer:

   Pin
   Recover
   Rollback
   Share
   Undocheckout
   Unpin

This is by design. SourceSafe assumes that changes made to files in a project
should be echoed to the project's working folder (directory). The GET does not
happen under two conditions:

1. If there is no working folder set for the project in the Visual SourceSafe
   Explorer.

2. When you use the -G- switch on the command line.

For some of these operations, the Visual SourceSafe Explorer provides a way to
override the default behavior. For more information, please refer to the User's
guide and Online Help for the individual commands.
