TITLE   :Unattended Err Msg: Setup Was Unable to Create the Following...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2000,4.0

KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When performing an unattended installation in which Sysdiff is used to install
additional applications, you may receive the following error message during the
initial phase of the installation:

   Setup was unable to create the following directory on the target drive:

   <drive letter>:\$\$$\<directory path>

   Check the target drive and make sure no files exist with the names that
   coincide with the target directory. Also check cabling to the drive.

   Setup cannot continue. Press ENTER to exit.

CAUSE
=====

If you have verified that your drive cabling is functioning properly and there
are no duplicate directory or file names, this error may be caused by the length
of your directory path. The maximum number of characters allowed in the
directory path is 55; this does not include the drive letter, colon, or any
backslashes.

WORKAROUND
==========

Two options are provided to work around this problem. Option B requires more
advanced knowledge of Sysdiff and the unattended installation process.

Option A
--------

1. Note the directory path shown on the screen when you receive this error.

2. On the computer that you are using to create the Sysdiff or diff file, either
   shorten the directory names, or move the directories in order to shorten the
   length of the path. If the directory that is causing the problem contains a
   software program, you may have to remove and re- install the program to a
   new, shortened directory path.

   Keep in mind that the Sysdiff program will truncate each directory name to
   eight characters. (Refer to the directory path from step 1.) Therefore, if
   you shorten the directory names, you must shorten them to fewer than eight
   characters.

   If the original directory is a subdirectory of the %Systemroot% directory
   (that is, C:\Winnt\<path>), the maximum number of characters cannot
   exceed 52. If the original directory is a subdirectory of the root partition
   (that is, D:\<path>), the maximum number of characters cannot exceed
   53.

3. After you have shortened the directory path to contain less than the maximum
   number of characters, you must re-create the Sysdiff or diff file and the
   Sysdiff or inf image.

Option B
--------

1. Note the directory path shown on the screen when you receive this error.

2. Locate this directory path in your $Oem$ subdirectory of the I386 share, and
   modify the length of the path by shortening the directory names to fewer than
   eight characters each.

   You need to shorten only as many directory names as required to reduce the
   length of the entire path to the maximum allowed characters. If the problem
   is with a subdirectory of the $Oem$\$$ directory, the maximum is 52. If it is
   a subdirectory of $Oem$\C or $Oem$\D, then the maximum is 53 characters, as
   counted from the first character following the $$ or the drive letter, not
   counting the backslashes.

3. Modify the $$Rename.txt file from the appropriate location (that is,
   $Oem$\$$\$$Rename.txt or $Oem$\c\$$Rename.txt) to reflect the modifications
   you made to the actual directory path in step 2 above.

   The $$Rename.txt file is used to rename the truncated directory and file names
   to their original names before the Sysdiff program truncated them to the
   MS-DOS 8.3 format.

   Be sure to make a copy of the $$Rename.txt file and review the existing format
   carefully before making any changes. A section header, which is the parent
   directory enclosed in brackets, must precede each directory that needs to be
   renamed. For example:

The directory path $Oem$\$$\Profiles\Alluse~1\Startm~1\Programs\Myprog~1 needs to
be renamed C:\Winnt\Profiles\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\My Programs.

The $$Rename.txt file should appear as follows:

    [Profiles]
    ALLUSE~1="All Users"

    [Profiles\ALLUSE~1]
    STARTM~1="Start Menu"

    [Profiles\ALLUSE~1\STARTM~1\Programs]
    Myprog~1="My Programs"
