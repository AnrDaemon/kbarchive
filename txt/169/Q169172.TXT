TITLE   :Allowed Directions Option Available for Leased SDLC Connection
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Allowed Directions options for a leased line SDLC connection are available
for selection under the SDLC Connection properties dialog in SNA Server Manager.
Allowed Directions is used to specify whether the SNA Server, the remote device,
or either can initiate the connection.

The Allowed Directions option was greyed out for leased line SDLC connections
under SNA Server 2.x because it does not apply for leased lines.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are no known workarounds, however leased line SDLC connections do not use
the Allowed Directions option. This is a cosmetic problem that has not caused
any communication problems.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
