TITLE   :XGEN: Help File for Mailbox Migration Tool Has Wrong Bitmap
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::Part 1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit Part 1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit includes a Mailbox Migration Tool. The
documentation included for this tool is incomplete. In addition, the help file
does not include the correct bitmap for the user interface.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The purpose of the tool is to make a complete copy of the mailbox content from
one server to another when the servers are in different sites or organizations.
A help file, Exchtool.hlp is included with the BackOffice Resource Kit that
documents the Mailbox Migration Tool and the other tools included in the
Resource Kit.

The help file (Exchtool.hlp) section "Running the Mailbox Migration Tool" does
not include the correct bitmap for the user interface. The released Migrate.exe
includes a Log File option that allows you to choose the path to the log file or
to allow you to append an existing log file. This option is missing from the
help file and the description for the option is also missing from the help file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
