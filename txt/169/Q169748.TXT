SUMMARY
=======

When distributing Systems Management Server packages to a NetWare distribution
server, you may receive an Event ID 108 error:

   108 Failed to install package to X. Verify the package server is up and
   running and has sufficient disk space. The SMS service account must exist on
   the package server and has the same password as the site server, and the
   service account must have admin privilege. If the package server is a NetWare
   server, verify the volume exists.

This event is also generated when the Everyone group does not exist on that
NetWare server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Systems Management Server Despooler fails to set permissions on the package
directory on the NetWare server because it cannot find the Everyone group.

The Despooler Log shows the following message:

   NWScanObject for user or group EVERYONE; return: ffff
   6/01/97 3:25:15 PM
   NWScanObject for user or group EVERYONE; return: ffff
