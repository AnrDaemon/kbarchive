TITLE   :Print Session Hangs in Spooling Status and Printing for Session
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An SNA Server 3270 Print Session gets stuck in Spooling status forever and all
printing for that print session stops. You have to stop the SNA Print Service
and restart in order to recover.

CAUSE
=====

The problem happens when print sessions are stopped while print jobs are still
being spooled and other print sessions are still running. The Spooling status
bit is never unset (because of a bug in the code that was supposed to do this),
and SNA Manager will display this status in preference to any other status bit
which may be set (closing, inactive and so on). Therefore, the status bar sits
at Spooling and never gets updated with the real status.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 sp1. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, printing status is set to idle whenever SNA Print Service
ends the current print job.
