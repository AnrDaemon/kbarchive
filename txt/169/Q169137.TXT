TITLE   :XADM: Exchange Mailbox Template Cannot Be Changed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The default template information as appears within the Exchange Administrator
when creating a new mailbox cannot be modified.

For example, the general property page of the mailbox cannot be modified to
replace the words Zip Code with the words Postal Code.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Custom Attributes property page of the mailbox object contains 10 unique
fields. Use the Custom Attributes property page on the mailbox object or while
creating a new mailbox to track any information about the recipients in your
site.

You can also define site wide custom attribute fields using the DS Site
Configuration object Custom Attributes property page. The fields you define on
the DS Site Configuration object Custom Attributes property page appear on the
Custom Attributes property page for all recipients in your site.

For example, suppose your company uses an employee ID numbering system. You can
create a custom attribute field called "Employee ID#" on the DS Site
Configuration object Custom Attributes property page. The Employee ID# field
then appears on the Custom Attributes property page of every recipient.

Additional Information
----------------------

Use details templates to customize Microsoft Exchange Server dialog boxes as seen
within the Exchange Client.

You can use the Templates property page to view all the fields and controls that
make up an existing Microsoft Exchange Server dialog box.

You can modify existing controls, add new controls, or remove controls. You can
also test the appearance of the dialog box before accepting your changes. To do
this, perform the following steps:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program.

2. In the left pane, double-click on the following container objects:

   a. Site

   b. Configuration

   c. Addressing

   d. Details Templates

3. Also in the left pane, double-click one of the template objects.

4. In the right pane, double-click Mailbox.

5. Click the Templates tab. On this properties page, you can modify, add, or
   delete items from the template. It also allows you to preview the template
   before accepting it.
