PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message from Microsoft Exchange Server containing some Nordic
characters, the characters are not translated correctly. The characters affected
by this are:

 - (ALT 145) is incorrectly translated to ae

 - (ALT 146) is incorrectly translated to AE

This character is also in the same code position as the Hebrew Zayen character,
and this also gets incorrectly translated to ae.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a problem in the MS Mail Connector.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
