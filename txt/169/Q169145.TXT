TITLE   :Event ID: 5511 - Mismatched SIDs

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Domain synchronization may fail with the following error:

   Source: NETLOGON
   Event ID: 5511
   The servers <DOMAINCONTROLLER1> and <DOMAINCONTROLLER2> both claim
   to be an NT Domain Controller for the <DOMAIN> domain. One of the
   servers should be removed from the domain because the servers have different
   security identifiers (SID).

CAUSE
=====

The easiest way for this error to occur is to install a domain controller while
either it or the other domain controller is disconnected from the network or
off-line. This will create a domain with the same name but it will have a
different security identifier (SID). As far as Windows NT domains, machine
accounts, and trusts are concerned, you have created a new domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

The problem domain controller must be re-installed when it can connect to the
primary domain controller.


Additional query words: trust installed account sync logon replication synchronization
