TITLE   :BUG: SQLState S1000 with SQL_AUTOCOMMIT_OFF/SQLTransact
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,3.0,7.0,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, versions 2.5, 3.0 
 - Microsoft Access 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG #: 4841 (Brazos)

SYMPTOMS
========

If an application does the following in the Microsoft Access 7.0 or 97 version
of the ODBC drivers more than seven times

   SQLSetConnectOption(hdbc, SQL_AUTOCOMMIT, SQL_AUTOCOMMIT_OFF);
   SQLTransact(henv, hdbc, SQL_COMMIT);

The error generated is:

   *szSqlState = "S1000", *pfNativeError = -1103,
   *szErrorMsg = "[Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access 97 Driver] "

If the application calls SQLExecDirect with any SQL statement, the error
generated is:

   szSqlState = "S1000", *pfNativeError = -1103, *pcbErrorMsg = 110
   szErrorMsg="[Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access 97 Driver] Couldn't start
   transaction; too many transactions already nested."

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not set the SQL_AUTOCOMMIT option repeatedly
within a connection. The SQL_AUTOCOMMIT option is a per-connection option. Once
this option is set, it stays valid until the connection is dropped; an ODBC
application does not have to set the option repeatedly within a connection.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Access ODBC driver
version 3.50.3602. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
