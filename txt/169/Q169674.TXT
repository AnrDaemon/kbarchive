TITLE   :XADM: Read Receipt May Not Be Delivered If Message Read Offline
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are working offline and read a message that requests a Read Receipt, the
Read Receipt notification message should be sent the next time you connect to
the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server. However, if you have exceeded
your mailbox quota, the Read Receipt notification will not be delivered. In
addition, a message similar to the following will be in the Deleted Items
folder:

   13:21:53 Synchronizing Mailbox 'John Doe'
   13:21:53 Sending off-line mail
   13:21:53 Error sending message
   13:21:53[8004010F-501-0-0]
   13:21:53The client operation failed.
   13:21:53Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store
   13:22:00 Synchronizing Folder 'Inbox'
   13:22:011 item(s) updated in online folder
   12:22:011 item(s) changed read-state in online folder
   13:22:01 Synchronizing Views
   13:22:01 Done

CAUSE
=====

When the Read Receipt message is submitted to Microsoft Exchange Information
Store (IS), the message is marked as a normal message, rather than a system
generated message. Since the Read Receipt message appears to be a regular
message, quota checks are performed against it. Because the quota check fails,
the message is not sent.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
