SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up a multilingual Web so that visitors to your
Web can view your content in their choice of language, such as English, Spanish,
or German.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up a multilingual web in FrontPage Explorer, follow these steps:

1. Set up the default home page in the <Root Web>.

2. Create a subweb for each language you want.

3. Set the default language property and HTML encoding for each subweb. To do
   this, follow these steps:

   a. On the Tools menu, click Web Settings.

   b. Click the Language tab.

   c. From the Default Web Language list, select the language you want to use.

   d. From the Default HTML Encoding list, select the type of HTML encoding you
      want. Click Apply.

   e. Click OK.

   If your FrontPage web is hosted on a supported UNIX web server, you are done.
   If not, go to step 4.

4. On the FrontPage compact disc, open the \frontpg\misc folder. There are five
   *.msg files in this folder--one for each language. Copy the *.msg file you
   want to use to the <frontpageroot>\version2.0\bin folder on the hard
   disk.
