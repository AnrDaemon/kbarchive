======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Windows 95/98 Dial-Up Networking (DUN) client to dial a Windows
NT Remote Access Service (RAS) server and you attempt to log on to a Windows NT
domain, your logon scripts may not run and you may receive the following error
message:

   No domain server was available to validate your password.
   You may not be able to gain access to some network resources.

In addition, when you attempt to gain access to a network share, you may receive
the following error message:

   Error 58: This operation cannot be performed by the specified server. Make
   sure that you have specified the correct computer name and command. If the
   problem persists, contact your network administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when both TCP/IP and the IPX/SPX compatible protocol are
installed on a Windows 95/98 client, and both protocols are enabled for the
dial-up connection. The IPX/SPX Netlogon requests may reach the primary domain
controller (PDC) before the TCP/IP Netlogon requests.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, "unbind" Client for Microsoft Networks from the IPX/SPX
protocol on the Windows 95/98 client:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Network.

2. Click the Configuration tab, click "IPX/SPX Compatible Protocol -> Dial-Up
   Adapter", and then click Properties.

3. Click the Bindings tab, and then clear the "Client for Microsoft Networks"
   check box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the PDC is configured for both TCP/IP and the IPX/SPX compatible protocol,
the PDC responds only to the first Netlogon request it receives, regardless of
other protocols configured on the server. Because the IPX/SPX Netlogon request
arrives before the TCP/IP Netlogon request, the server responds with an IPX/SPX
type 20 broadcast. By default, the RAS server does not forward IPX/SPX type 20
broadcast packets to the client unless two-way broadcasting of type 20 packets
(NetBIOS over IPX) is enabled on the RAS server.

Because of additional bandwidth requirements, do not enable two-way broadcasting
of IPX/SPX type 20 (14h) broadcast packets.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q173607 Client Not Authenticated by Domain Through RAS Member Server

Auditing successful logon and logoff attempts at the PDC shows the user
successfully logged on, and a Network Monitor capture shows the IPX/SPX Netlogon
requests arriving first.
