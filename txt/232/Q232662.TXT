TITLE   :Problems Accessing Secured Site with Czech WinNT SP4 and IE 5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The information in this article applies to the 
Czech version(s) of Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install the Czechoslovakian version of Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 on a
computer with the Czech version of Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 4,
you may experience problems gaining access to secure HTTP Web sites. For
example:

   https://microsoft.com/

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by an incorrect version of Schannel.dll that was
included with the Czech version of Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4. To display
secure http Web sites properly, the version of Schannel.dll has to be at least
4.85.1900.1877.

RESOLUTION
==========

This fix upgrades Schannel.dll so that secure sites are displayed properly. A
supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The Czech version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:
