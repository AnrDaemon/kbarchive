TITLE   :Error Message When Using a Colon in File or Folder Name in SFU
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Services for UNIX Add-On Pack 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Services for UNIX Client for NFS component to create a file or
folder name that contains a colon on an NFS file share, you may receive an error
message. For example, if you attempt to create a folder named 7:5, you may
receive an error message similar to the following example:

   MakeDir cannot create 7:5 : Not owner.

CAUSE
=====

When only one character precedes a colon in a file or folder name, Windows NT
interprets the file or folder name as a drive letter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, do not use file or folder names that have only one
character preceding a colon.
