SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4), you cannot connect to a
downlevel server or share using a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that is
longer than 32 characters. The NET USE command does not work and the following
error message is displayed:

   system error 67: The network name cannot be found

This behavior occurs when you connect to a downlevel server and the server
message block (SMB) dialect negotiated is LAN Manager 2.1 (dialect number 6).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because there are several changes to the redirector in SP4.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
