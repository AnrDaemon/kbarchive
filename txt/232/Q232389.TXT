WORKAROUND
==========

There are two workarounds:

 - On all servers that are initiating the connection:

   1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program.

   2. In the left pane, click the Connections object, and in the right pane,
      double click the Dynamic Ras Connector to be modified.

   3. Click the RAS Override tab, and specify an account other than Service in
      the Connect As portion.

   The alternate account specified must have Service Account Admin permissions on
   the remote Exchange Server computer.

 - Copy in Rassapi.dll from a Windows NT Service Pack 3 installation to the
   Winnt\System32 directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Dynamic RAS fails to transfer if the account specified on the Override tab is
called Service. The problem has been known to occur when you dial computers
running Windows NT Server that have been upgraded to Service Pack 4.

After the upgrade is complete, accessing the Service account through the RAS
Administrator interface yields the following error message:

   Error 6: The handle is invalid.
