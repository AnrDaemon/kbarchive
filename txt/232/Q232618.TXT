TITLE   :XADM: Importing Custom Recipient Logs Event ID 236
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to import a custom recipient through the Exchange Administrator
Program by using Directory Import on the Tools menu, the following stop error
Event ID 236 may be logged in the application log.

   Event ID:236
   Source: MSExchangeDSImp
   Type: Error
   Category: None

   Unable to process custom recipient <Name of custom recipient> because
   target address SMTP:(user@<company_name>.com) has already been assigned
   to Address Book entry /o=DomainName/ou=Site/cn=Recipients/cn=user.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you are importing a custom recipient that has an SMTP
alias that already exists. When the same address already exists for the user you
are importing, you cannot import the custom recipient.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the .csv file and change the duplicate e-mail address for the specified
custom recipient. Try the directory import operation again.
