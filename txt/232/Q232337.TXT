PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbDatabase kbGrpDSVCDB kbDSupport kbDAO360

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the MFC AppWizard or ClassWizard with a DAO data source and an Access 2000
.mdb file causes a failure with the following error message:

   Unrecognized Database Format

CAUSE
=====

The Wizards use DAO version 3.5, which cannot read Access 2000 .mdb files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Convert the .mdb file to a previous version to use it with MFC AppWizard or
ClassWizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To convert the Access 2000 .mdb file to Access 97 format complete the following
steps:

1. From the Access 2000 main menu, click Tools.

2. Select Database Utilities.

3. Click Convert Database.

4. Select To Prior Access Database Version.

NOTE: The .mdb file can also be converted programmatically by using the DAO
DBEngine CompactDatabase method.
MFC version 6.0 will by default use DAO 3.5. In order for your application to use
DAO 3.6 and work with Access 2000 the .mdb files, you need to define the
following in your application:

   AfxGetModuleState()->m_dwVersion = 0x0601;
