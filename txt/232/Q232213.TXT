AddReservedIp:

Description: Adds a reserved Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP) address to an already existing scope.

Command syntax: "Dhcpcmd ServerIpAddress AddReservedIp ScopeAddress ReserveIp
HardwareString [Clientname] [ClientComment] [DHCP|Bootp|Both]" (without the
quotation marks)

Example: "dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 addreservedip 11.101.0.0 11.101.13.53 08002B30369B
nursvd1 dhcp" (without the quotation marks)

RemoveReservedIp:

Description: Removes a reserved TCP/IP address from the existing scope it belongs
to.

Command syntax: "Dhcpcmd ServerIpAddress RemoveReservedIp ScopeAddress ReserveIp
HardwareString" (without the quotation marks)

Example: "dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 removereservedip 11.101.0.0 11.101.13.53
08002B30369B" (without the quotation marks)

GetVersion:

Description: Displays the DHCP server version

Command syntax: "Dhcpcmd ServerIpAddress GetVersion" (without the quotation
marks)

Example: "dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 getversion" (without the quotation marks)

MibCounts:

Description: Displays DHCP server statistic information for the current DHCP
server.

Command syntax: "Dhcpcmd ServerIpAddress MibCounts" (without the quotation
marks)

Example: "dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 mibcounts" (without the quotation marks)

ServerConfig:

Description: Displays and sets server parameters.

Command syntax: "Dhcpcmd ServerIpAddress ServerConfig [<ConfigParameter>]
[<Value>]" (without the quotation marks)

Where <ConfigParameter> is any of the DHCP server parameters, and
<Value> is the value you want to set that parameter to.

NOTE: Type "dhcpcmd serveripaddress serverconfig" (without the quotation marks)
to display a list of the DHCP server parameters.

Examples: "dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 serverconfig" (without the quotation marks)

"dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 serverconfig backupinterval 15" (without the quotation marks)

The first example displays DHCP server parameters, and the second example sets
the BackupInterval parameter to 15.

Checkdb:

Description: Displays the DHCP scope information database.

Command syntax: "Dhcpcmd ServerIpAddress checkdb scope_address [Fix]" (without
the quotation marks)

Example: "dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 checkdb 11.101.0.0 fix" (without the quotation
marks)

NOTE: The Fix parameter reconciles the database. If you do not use the Fix
parameter, only the DHCP server version and the "command successfully completed"
informational message are displayed.

Subnet Commands
---------------

CreateSubnet:

Description: Creates a new subnet, and should be immediately followed by the
AddIpRange command. If not, your computer can be inconsistent and the server may
not behave as expected.

Command syntax: "Dhcpcmd server_IP_address CreateSubnet scope_address scope_mask
scope_name" (without the quotation marks)

Example: "dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 createsubnet 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 mysubnet" (without

DeleteSubnet:

Description: Deletes an existing subnet.

Command syntax: "Dhcpcmd ServerIpAddress DeleteSubnet scope_address <
force_flag>" (without the quotation marks)

Where <force_flag> = dhcpfullforce or dhcpnoforce

If you use dhcpfullforce, all clients with active leases in that scope are
deleted before the scope is deleted. If there are clients with active leases in
a scope, dhcpfullforce must be specified or deletesubnet does not work.

Example: "dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 deletesubnet 10.0.0.0 dhcpfullforce" (without the
quotation marks)

This command deletes the subnet 10.0.0.0 and any leases that are present for this
subnet.

SetSubnetState:

Description: Enables and disables a subnet.

Command syntax: "Dhcpcmd ServerIpAddress setsubnetstate scope_address state"
(without the quotation marks)

Where state has a value of 0 if the scope is to be enabled and a value of non-0
if the scope is to be disabled.

Example: "dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 setsubnetstate 10.0.0.0 0" (without the quotation
marks)

(without the quotation marks)

AddExcludeRange:

Description: Adds a range of exclusion addresses to the scope.

Command syntax: "Dhcpcmd ServerIpAddress AddExcludeRange scope_address start_excl
end_excl" (without the quotation marks)

Example: "dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 addexcluderange 10.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.10" (without
the quotation marks)

This command excludes IP addresses between 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.10.

RemoveExcludeRange:

Description: Removes an existing exclusion range.

Command syntax: "Dhcpcmd ServerIpAddress RemoveExcludeRange scope_address
start_excl end_excl" (without the quotation marks)

Example: "dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 removeexcluderange 10.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.10"
(without the quotation marks)

This command removes an existing exclusion of IP addresses from 10.0.01 to
10.0.0.10

Active-Lease Commands
---------------------

EnumClients:

Description: Lists the lease information in a different format.

Command syntax: "Dhcpcmd ServerIpAddress EnumClients ScopeAddress [-v | -h]"
(without the quotation marks)

Where -v displays detailed lease information and -h displays lease and hardware
information.

Example: "dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 enumclients 11.101.0.0 -h" (without the quotation
marks)

scope belongs to some another scope. If the value is 0, an error message is
returned if the scope belongs to another superscope.

Example: "dhcpcmd 127.0.0.1 setsuperscope newsuperscope 10.0.0.0 1" (without the
quotation marks)

DeleteSuperScope:

Description: Deletes a superscope and optionally converts all subordinate
elements to a different superscope. If the target superscope does not exist, it
is created.
