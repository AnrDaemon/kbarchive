TITLE   :LPD Job May Cause TCPSVCS to Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you send a print job by using LPR to a TCP/IP print server, the TCP/IP
print server may stop responding (hang) and causes over 90 percent CPU usage in
TCPSVCS.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the print job contains a value of 0x1B (ESC) at offset
0xFFF (4095). TCPSVCS has a routine to detect PCL or PostScript jobs; this
routine enters an infinite loop under these conditions.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
