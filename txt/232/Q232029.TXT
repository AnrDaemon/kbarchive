TITLE   :XFOR: Scheduled Dirsync Retries when Import Container Missing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you schedule directory synchronization (dirsync) for the Microsoft Exchange
Connector for Novell GroupWise to run automatically, the service initiates the
dirsync process in both directions. If you do not specify a Recipients container
in either the Import or Export containers' properties, the dirsync process runs
indefinitely.

CAUSE
=====

The scheduled dirsync process starts a dirsync cycle for both directions. If a
Recipients container is missing, dirsync runs continuously until it is stopped
manually.

RESOLUTION
==========

Specify a Recipients container for both the Import and Export containers. If you
want one-way dirsync, use the filtering mechanism on the GroupWise Connector to
filter out GroupWise recipients from becoming custom recipients in the Exchange
Server directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
