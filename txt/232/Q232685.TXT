TITLE   :XADM: Error 1084 Reports Corruption in an RTF Attachment
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A number of errors appear in the application log on the Exchange Server computer
and contain the following information:

   1084: MSExchangeIS

   There is corruption in rich text format (RTF). Compressed RTF size %1.Extra
   data: dwMagic %2. size %3, raw size %4, CRC-32 %5. Logon: %6 Message ID: %7
   From: %8 To: %9 Cc: %10

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the clients are using a utility called "Secrets for
Windows" or a similar client-side encryption application.

Secrets for Windows encrypts data at the file level, not message level. When
these encrypted files are attached to a message and sent through Exchange Server
to another user, Exchange Server is unable to process the message correctly
because the RTF format attachment no longer contains the correct checksum in the
header.

RESOLUTION
==========

Exchange Server is operating by design. The attachment will still be delivered
unaltered (remaining encrypted). The recipient will still be able to decrypt the
attachment correctly using the Secrets for Windows application.

The Event ID:1084 "RTF corruption" is reporting properly, because it is not a
valid RTF format.

MORE INFORMATION
================
