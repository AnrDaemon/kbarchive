SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Network Monitor gives you the capability to connect to other computers
and capture traffic from another computer. You can do this across a router or a
Remote Access Service (RAS) connection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The two primary components of Network Monitor are the Network Monitor Agent and
the user interface. The Network Monitor Agent binds to the user interface and
passes traffic up to the program. The Network Monitor Agent can run on any
compatible computer while the program is running on a separate computer.

How to Use Network Monitor Agent on a Second Computer
-----------------------------------------------------

On the Network Monitor Agent host computer:

1. Install the Network Monitor Agent (in Control Panel, click Network, click
   Services, click Add, and then click Network Monitor Agent).

2. In Control Panel, click Services, click Network Monitor Agent, and then click
   Start. (If you want the Network Monitor Agent to start when the computer
   starts, click Startup, and then click Automatic.)

To connect to a remote Network Monitor Agent:

1. Start Network Monitor.

2. From the Capture menu, click Networks.

3. Click the name of the remote connection, and then click Connect.

   NOTE: Until you make a connection, this entry is REMOTE. After you make a
   connection, REMOTE is replaced by the NetBIOS name of the remote computer.

4. In the Agent Name box, specify the name of the agent to which you are
   connecting. This name is the NetBIOS name of the remote computer. A universal
   naming convention (UNC) path name is not required.

5. In the User Comment box, click a comment to associate with the agent name you
   specified. This comment is displayed when users attempt to connect to the
   Network Monitor Agent.

6. In the Agent Status Update Frequency dialog box, specify the frequency (in
   seconds), in which you want the statistics from the remote capture displayed
   on your local computer. This number must be between 1-65 (the default is 2).

7. Click the Slow Link option. This option extends the period of time that your
   connection can be idle before Network Monitor concludes that the connection
   is unsuccessful and disconnects from the Network Monitor Agent. This option
   is recommended for all asynchronous connections.

8. Click Connect. If the Network Monitor Agent on the remote computer is
   password protected, you are prompted to type a password. If the Network
   Monitor Agent is running on a computer with only one network adapter
   installed, Network Monitor connects to that network adapter. If the Network
   Monitor Agent is installed on a computer that is multihomed, a dialog box
   that lists the network adapters installed is displayed. An asterisk appears
   next to the network adapter that Network Monitor used to make the connection
   to the remote computer. This network adapter is connected to the same network
   segment to which you are connected. Unless you want to capture statistics
   from your own your local network segment, you should select one of the other
   network adapters that is displayed.

9. Click Capture/Start to begin capturing data.
