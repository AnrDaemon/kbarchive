SUMMARY
=======

The Collection object in Visual Basic provides a convenient way to refer to a
related group of items as a single object. This article shows a simple sample
that demonstrates a way to return the Visual Basic Collection to an Active
Server Pages (ASP) page and display the contents in the browser

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Collections in Visual Basic have a base of 1 by default. You'll use the FOR
loop and a Collection's COUNT property to iterate and display each element in
the collection.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

 - Open a blank new Visual Basic ActiveX DLL project.

 - Rename the project as "prjCol" and class as "clsCol."

 - Add this code to class clsCol:

   ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   ' ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
   ' TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR A
   ' PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

   ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
   Dim MyCol As New Collection
   Public Function RetCol() As Variant

       MyCol.Add "Bill", "1"
       MyCol.Add "Paul", "2"
       MyCol.Add "Steve", "3"
      
       Set RetCol = MyCol

   End Function

   Public Function ColCount() As Integer
       ColCount = MyCol.Count
   End Function

 - Save and Compile the project.

 - Create a blank new ASP page and add the following code:

   <%
   ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
   ' THIS CODE AND INFORMATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
   ' ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
   ' TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR A
   ' PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

   ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
   dim obj
   dim col
   dim i

   set obj = server.createobject("prjCol.clsCol")

   set col = obj.RetCol

   for i = 1 to obj.ColCount
   	Response.Write col.Item(cstr(i))
   next

   set obj = Nothing

   %>

 - Save the ASP page under one of the virtual roots, run and test the page.
