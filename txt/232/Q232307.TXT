SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to one-off address mail from Microsoft Exchange
Server to SNADS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To one-off address mail to SNADS, perform the following:

1. From the Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook client, compose a new
   message.

2. In the To field, type the following:

   [SNADS:DGN(DEN)]

   where DGN is the recipient's Distribution Group Name and DEN is the
   recipient's Distribution Element Name. DGN and DEN are addressing components
   of a SNADS address. DGN is similar to a post office (or just a grouping of
   users); DEN is similar to a username. For example:

   [SNADS:MICROSFT(USERID)]
