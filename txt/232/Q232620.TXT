TITLE   :Spooled Print Jobs Are Deleted from Queue Without Being Printed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Quota Server from Northern Technologies on a print server, print
jobs are successfully spooled, then deleted from the queue, but are never
printed.

When you use Perfmon.exe to observe Paged Pool bytes for the Spoolss.exe process,
a continual increase over time and a sharp decrease during the same period of
time that print jobs are reportedly lost is displayed. During this same time
period, the Quota Server service (Qsserver.exe), may display CPU usage at 70
percent or higher.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, please contact Northern Technologies software support
for an update of Quota Server for Windows NT.
