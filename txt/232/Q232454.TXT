SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to manually configure a cluster's media access
control (MAC) address in Windows NT Load Balancing Service (WLBS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

By default, WLBS derives the cluster MAC address from the virtual IP (VIP)
address that you type in the Primary IP Address field in the WLBS Setup dialog
box. The MAC address automatically appears in the Network Address field and
cannot be modified. When you configure the VIP address in cluster hosts, WLBS
ensures all hosts use the same cluster MAC address.

To manually configure the cluster MAC address:

1. Set the IPToMACEnable registry value to 0.

   NOTE: When this value is set to 1 (the default), WLBS automatically derives a
   MAC address from the VIP address.

2. At a command prompt, type "wlbs stop" (without the quotation marks).

3. At a command prompt, type "wlbs reload" (without the quotation marks) to
   reload registry parameters.

4. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, double-click Network,
   and then click the Adapters tab.

5. Click WLBS Virtual NIC, and then click Properties.

6. Modify the MAC address, and then click OK.

7. Close Control Panel, and then restart the computer.

NOTE: When you manually configure a cluster's MAC address, make sure the MAC
address is the same for all cluster hosts.
