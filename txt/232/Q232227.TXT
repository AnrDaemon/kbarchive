TITLE   :SMS: Inaccurate Installation Date Is Reported in the Inventory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you take an inventory of a Systems Management Server-based client
computer, an inaccurate installation time/date may be visible in Operating
System properties.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the operating system installation time/date
inventory item is obtained from the following registry key on individual client
computers:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\installdate

This value represents a time/date as an offset in seconds from midnight, January
1, 1970. This value is populated incorrectly during the installation of the
operating system. When the Systems Management Server inventory agent later
converts this value to a time/date to report as inventory, the value is
converted correctly, but because the value itself is in error, the time/date
reported is inaccurate by several hours.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
