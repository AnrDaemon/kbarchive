SUMMARY
=======

Free Busy information is message based. Specifically, each user sends a single
message to the Schedule+ Free Busy folder with all of their calendar information
in the message. Each time a user makes changes to the calendar, a new message is
sent to the system Free Busy folder (which overwrites the previous message).

You may need to rebuild the Schedule+ Free Busy information using the Guidgen.exe
or Mdbvu32.exe utilities, which delete Schedule+ Free Busy messages for users.

   Q152960 XADM: Reassigning Site Roles after Removing the First Server in an
   Exchange Site


The Schedule+ Free Busy folder is repopulated when users create new calendar
items or accept meeting requests. During this period some users' Free Busy
information is temporarily unavailable because they have not created or accepted
any meeting items.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Until a user logs on to the server and makes or accepts an appointment (a "busy"
time), there is no Free Busy information to view.

Users who are out of the office when the Schedule+ Free Busy folder is recreated
have no viewable Free Busy information.

If there is no busy time (a meeting or accepted meeting request) in a user's
calendar, an automatically accepted meeting booked as tentative does not create
a new Free Busy message for that user.
