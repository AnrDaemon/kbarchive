OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) on your Compaq Deskpro
(2000, 4000, or 6000) computer, the following error message may be displayed
during the power-on self test (POST):

   1782 Disk Controller Failure

The error message is displayed after a warm boot (clicking Start, clicking
Shutdown, and then clicking the "Restart the Computer" button, or clicking
Start, clicking Shutdown, clicking the "Shutdown the Computer" button, and then
pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL).

The error message is not displayed after a cold reboot (clicking Start, clicking
Shutdown, clicking the "Shutdown the Computer" button, and then physically
turning off the computer for 60 seconds).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the synchronization in the timing between the
controller and the hard disk is unsuccessful. There are certain BIOS revisions
in the Compaq Deskpro 2000, 4000, or 6000 that cause this behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, update the system BIOS of the Compaq Deskpro computer.
