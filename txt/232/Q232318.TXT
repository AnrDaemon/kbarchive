SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to one-off address a message to a user on PROFS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To one-off address a message to a PROFS user:

1. From the Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook client, compose a new
   message.

2. In the To box, type the address in the following format:

   "[PROFS:NODEID(USERID)]" (without the quotation marks)

NODEID and USERID are addressing components of a PROFS address, each of which can
contain up to eight characters. NODEID is similar to a post office (or just a
grouping of users); USERID is similar to a username.

For example:

   [PROFS:MICROSFT(JOHNDOE)]
