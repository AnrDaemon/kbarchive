KEYWORDS:kbprint kbGDI kbPrinting kbSpooler kbOSWin95 kbOSWin98 kbGrpDSGDI

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SetPrinter() API can be used to change/query a printer's settings. The
settings that are available vary depending on the level of the call. It is
possible to change/query the port name for a printer using levels 2 and 5.
However, on Win9x, when trying to change the port on a printer using
SetPrinter() with level 5 , the port is not changed even though no errors are
detected.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, call SetPrinter() with level 2 and a properly
populated PRINTER_INFO_2.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
