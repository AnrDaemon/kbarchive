TITLE   :MMC Does not Show Physical Directories under FTP Root
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbiis400 kbiis500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When looking at the directories under the FTP root with the Microsoft Management
Console (MMC), only the virtual directories are displayed even though physical
directories are present.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. The MMC will only display virtual directories under
the FTP root.

WORKAROUND
==========

To see a list of all directories, both physical and virtual, present under the
FTP root you will need to create a virtual directory pointing to the physical
directory. This will have to be done for every physical directory.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
