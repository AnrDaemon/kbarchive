SUMMARY
=======

With the Web Site Certificate Wizard, you can perform many certificate
management tasks, including assigning an existing server certificate to a Web
site that was added after the certificate was created.

Note: The server certificate must already exist in your certificate store. If the
public and private keys are not accessible, this process fails.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To assign an existing server certificate to a Web site, do the following:

1. Start the Internet Services Manager.

2. Navigate to your Web site and right-click the name.

3. Click Properties.

4. Click the Directory Security tab, and under the Secure Communications
   section, click the Server Certificate button. This starts the Web Site
   Certificate Wizard.

5. Click Next, choose Assign an Existing Certificate, and then click Next.

6. The screen that follows displays all available certificates found in your
   certificate store. Choose the certificate you want by highlighting it, and
   then click Next.

7. On the summary screen that shows the certificate you are going to use on this
   site, check the common name to make sure that this is the name users will use
   when they access your Web site. Check the expiration date as well.

8. Click Next, and then click Finish.

For more information about the Certificate Stores and importing certificates for
use in the certificate stores, see the "Certificates" section in the Windows
2000 documentation.
