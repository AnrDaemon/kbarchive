TITLE   :XCON: MTA Is Leaking During Content Conversion
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you configure an X.400 connector as shown below to disallow MS Exchange
Contents to an Exchange Server site, and you send several messages out this
X.400 connector, you may see a small but noticeable memory leak. This memory
leak is logged just before content conversion is done.

X.400 Connector Configuration
-----------------------------

On the Advanced tab, click X.400 Link Options, and clear the Allow MS Exchange
Contents check box.

CAUSE
=====

In this configuration, the received native MDBEF formatted message must be
converted to pure X.400 (P22) format. During this conversion, a memory leak
occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
