SYMPTOMS

When you are starting your computer, you may be prompted to insert a

   screen.

 - You receive an error message with exception code 0D at 0C7A:0000794D.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this behavior from occurring, use any of the following methods:

 - Insert the driver disk before you click Browse.

 - Insert the disk after the driver is not found, and then click Back to let
   Windows locate the driver.

 - If you click Other Locations, insert the driver disk and then type "a:"
   (without the quotation marks) when you are prompted for the path to the
   driver.

If you do not use any of these methods and you receive an error message, simply
restart the computer and follow the instructions on the screen.
