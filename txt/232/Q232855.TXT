========================================================================

The Corporate Update (corpupd.exe) is a companion package for the Windows
95 Y2K Update (w95y2k.exe) provided in response to corporate customer
feedback regarding the Windows 95 Y2K Update package.  

The Windows 95 Y2K Update needs to be installed before installing the
companion Corpupd.exe.  

========================================================================

Corpupd.exe supports the following install switches:

   There are several installation options available to advanced users 
   when installing the Corporate Update. You can view these options at
   any time by clicking Start, clicking Run, typing corpupd.exe /? and
   then clicking OK.

   To use the optional installation parameters below, type
   corpupd.exe <option>

   /Q - Quiet mode (skips all user prompts) - Useful for silent 
        installations in batch setups.
   /T: <full path> - Specifies a temporary working folder.
   /C - Extract files only to the folder when used also with /T - 
        Allows an administrator to download files into a specified 
        location.
   /C: <cmd> - Override install command defined by author - Not used 
        for this update.

========================================================================

Corpupd.exe addresses the following concerns:

Confusion regarding a Windows 95 Hotfix (Q172707)
  1. The hotfix registered itself to display in Control Panel, Add/Remove
     Programs and QFECheck.exe.  The Windows 95 Y2K Update supercedes the
     hotfix but did not remove the registry entries.  Corpupd.exe corrects
     this by removing the hotfix registry entries that are no longer
     needed and removing the ability to inadvertently uninstall.
  2. The hotfix mistakenly copied command.com to the windows\command
     folder.  Corpupd.exe corrects this by removing command.com from 
     the windows\command folder.  The Windows 95 Y2K Update correctly 
     updates command.com in the appropriate locations.

Registering the Windows 95 Y2K Update so QFECheck identifies the install.
   Corporate customers requested that the Windows 95 Y2K Update is 
   displayed in QFECheck.exe to easily determine that the Windows 95 Y2K
   Update is installed.  Corpupd.exe adds the registry entries needed for
   this.

Confusion regarding VDHCP.386
   The Windows 95 Y2K Update included a Y2K compliant VDHCP.386 for "clean"
   installs of Windows 95 or Windows 95 OSR2.x.  It did not include a Y2K
   compliant version of VDHCP.386 for systems which had installed either the
   Microsoft DUN 1.3 or Winsock2 Updates.  A Microsoft DUN 1.3/Winsock2 Y2K 
   Update is now available which includes a Y2K compliant version of
   VDHCP.386 for systems running the Microsoft DUN 1.3 or Winsock2 Updates.
   Corpupd.exe includes the Microsoft DUN 1.3 or Winsock2 Y2K Update.
