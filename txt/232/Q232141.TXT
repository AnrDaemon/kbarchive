SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to load balance Telnet using Windows NT Load
Balancing Service (WLBS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To load balance Telnet:

1. Configure a port rule on all cluster hosts with a port range from 23 to 23,
   and choose TCP as the protocol.

2. Click Multiple Hosts, and then click None for the Affinity value.

NOTE: A Telnet session spans just one TCP connection, so Affinity is not needed.
