TITLE   :Permissions on the Temp\x Folder Are Incorrectly Reset
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 4, Terminal Server Edition,
a user may receive an "access denied" error message when attempting to gain
access to the %SystemRoot%\Temp\<x> folder (where <x> is the session
ID assigned to the user).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when a user improperly quits a Terminal Server session; the
%SystemRoot%\Temp\<x> folder is not properly deleted.

When a second user logs on and receives the session number used by the first
user, the second user does not have the correct permissions to the
%SystemRoot%\Temp\<x> folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, delete the first user's %SystemRoot%\Temp\<x>
folder, or view the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Server
4.0 Service Pack 4, Terminal Server Edition.
