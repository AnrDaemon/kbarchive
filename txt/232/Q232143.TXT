SYMPTOMS
========

When you are logged on as a standard user and you run a Microsoft Installer
(MSI) package, you may receive error messages similar to the following messages
during the installation phase:

   Error 1913, Could not update the file... Verify that the file exists and that
   you can access it.

   -or-

   1321 The Installer has insufficient privileges to modify this file:
   <filename>

   -or-

   1401 Could not create key: <registry key>

Other error messages may occur, depending on whether the change was made in the
registry or the file system, but the error message usually reports a lack of
privileges on the part of the user or service to perform an action relating to
the installation of the software.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because SYSTEM has been denied access to the directory,
file, or registry keys necessary to install the software.

RESOLUTION
==========

In order for Windows Installer to finish its function with elevated privileges,
the file system and the all registry keys must allow SYSTEM full control over
these components to allow for installations to take place.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
