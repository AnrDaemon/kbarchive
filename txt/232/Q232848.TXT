SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT Diagnostics, also known as WinMSD, is a utility used to gather
detailed configuration information about computers running Windows NT. It can be
beneficial for Microsoft Support Professionals to use this information to
troubleshoot issues. End users can also use this utility to record current
configuration information on each of their computers for archival purposes.
WinMSD can be run from the graphical user interface (GUI) or at an MS-DOS
command prompt.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WinMSD usage:

winmsd [\\computername] [/a /s /f /p]
/a  Causes a complete system report to be generated
/s  Causes a summary system report to be generated
/f  Causes the system report to be sent to a file
/p  Causes the system report to be send to the current printer

If you run the utility from the command prompt without switches, a GUI appears,
which has multiple tabs that allow you to view specific information. The default
tab is the Version tab, which indicates the version, service pack, and serial
number.

WinMSD can be run from a command prompt or from the Start Menu.

For troubleshooting purposes, a common command would be:

   "winmsd /a /f " (without the quotation marks)

This queries the local computer and creates a text file (computername.txt) in the
current directory.

Another common usage is:

   "winmsd \\computername /a /f" (without the quotation marks)

This queries a remote computer (computername) and creates a text file
(Computername.txt) in the current directory.

To use the GUI version:

1. From the Start menu, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
   then click Windows NT Diagnostics.

2. Click Print.

3. Set the following option:

   Scope = All Tabs, Detail Level = Complete, Destination = File

4. You can name and locate the file anywhere you wish.
