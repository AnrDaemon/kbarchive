TITLE   :IIS: Export Private Key Opt Gray Exporting Server Certificate
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbIIS kbiis500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Certificates snap-in in Windows 2000, you can do many tasks regarding
certificates and certificate management. One of these tasks is exporting server
certificates for use in an Internet Information Services 5.0 web server. In
order for a server certificate to be used by the web server, you must export the
private key along with the certificate. Without the private key, data encryption
(and therefore secure communications) is not possible.

When exporting the server certificate from the server's personal certificate
store, you may not have the option to export the private key. If this is the
case, when the certificate was imported, the option to allow the private key to
be exported may have been unchecked. This is a security measure to prevent a
possible compromise of the server's private key. Since this could be a potential
security risk, the option to mark the private key as exportable is not checked
by default.

RESOLUTION
==========

In order to correct this problem, you will need access to the original
certificate backup (.pfx) file. To ensure this problem does not happen in the
future (should you want to export the private key again) make sure during the
import process that you select the box "mark the private key as exportable."
