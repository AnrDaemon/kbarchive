TITLE   :XFOR:Meeting Updates Cause Multiple Meeting Requests w/GWC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a meeting update is sent to a GroupWise user, the original meeting
scheduled in the GroupWise user's calendar will not be updated correctly.
Ideally, the original meeting will be deleted and replaced with the new updated
meeting. However, all meeting updates are sent as new meeting requests. The
meeting update will be a new meeting request with a prefix "Updated:
<original subject>" in the subject line.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a limitation in the interoperability between the
Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise and the API Gateway.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that this problem does not affect the Web 3 version of the GroupWise
Connector, only the next version of this connector.

Additional query words: meetings, multiple updates
