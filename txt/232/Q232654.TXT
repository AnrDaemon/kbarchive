TITLE   :BUG:CommonDialog FilterIndex Always Returns Default Filter Index
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0,2.0,2.11,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp600bug kbOSWinCEsearch kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - Microsoft Windows CE versions 2.0, 2.11 for the Handheld PC 
    - Microsoft Windows CE version 2.11 for the Palm-size PC 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The FilterIndex property of the CommonDialog control that ships with the
Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 (VBCE6) will always return the
index for the first defined filter despite being changed by the user at run
time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code will behave differently between VBCE and Visual Basic 6.0.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Windows CE HPC Project in Visual Basic.

2. Select Components from the Project menu and reference the Microsoft CE Common
   Dialog Control 6.0.

3. Add a Common dialog and a Command Button to Form1.

4. Paste the following code into Form1:

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       CommonDialog1.Filter = "Text (*.txt)|*.txt|Pictures (*.bmp)|*.bmp"
       CommonDialog1.FilterIndex = 1
       CommonDialog1.ShowOpen
       
       MsgBox "FilterIndex: " & CommonDialog1.FilterIndex
   End Sub

5. Run the project and click the Command Button.

6. Select a text file to open and notice that the message box will display
   "FilterIndex: 1."

7. Click the Command Button again and select a bitmap file to open.

Notice that the message box will again display "FilterIndex: 1," when it should
display "FilterIndex: 2." This is inconsistent with how the Visual Basic 6.0
CommonDialog control works where the FilterIndex will reflect the user's
selection.
