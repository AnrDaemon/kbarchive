TITLE   :Content Ratings Dates/Times in MMC Use Time Zone of Client
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the IIS snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to makes
changes to the Content Ratings expiration date on a remote server, the values
saved to the metabase use the time zone of the client and not the server.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The IIS snap-in for the MMC is designed to use the time zone
of the client computer that the Web administrator is using and not the server
when making changes. This allows a Web administrator located in one part of a
WAN to set ratings to expire based on the Web administrator's location instead
of the server's location.
