TITLE   :XCON: MTA Loses Attachment on FTBP Messages with No Subject
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Exchange Server Message Transfer Agent (MTA) receives a native X.400
message from a foreign MTA that was sent with a File Transfer Body Part (FTBP)
and the originator did not add a subject to the message, depending upon whose
foreign MTA sent the message, when the message is viewed by a client, the
original attachment is lost, and a zero length attachment called Att.dat is
present. If the originator did add a subject, the attachment will be viewed
correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The MTA did not correctly handle the different ASN.1 encoding used by the
foreign MTA.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
