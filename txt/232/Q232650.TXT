The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

In order to display and print JPG images that are stored in Visual FoxPro
general fields, there must be an OLE server for JPG files installed on that
computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To display any file type in a general field, and be able to view and print it,
the object type must have a OLE Server associated. This OLE server provides
information about the file being linked or embedded. This information tells
FoxPro how to display and print the file.

One example of an OLE server for JPG files is the Microsoft Image Editor, which
is included in the Microsoft Office CD's.

If a JPG file is embedded or linked in a Visual FoxPro general field before the
OLE server is installed, that object (the JPG file) will need to be re-added to
the project. You must perform this step because the OLE server adds a lot of
information to the file that tells Visual FoxPro how to reference the file.
