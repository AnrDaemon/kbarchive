SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a computer, the Terminal Server Client Configuration window
may be displayed even though you have already configured it to use a terminal
server connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. On the client computer, configure the terminal server connection.

2. In the registry, note the name of the key under the following registry key:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client

   NOTE: Each terminal server connection creates a registry key.

3. Close Registry Editor.

4. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

5. In the Named box, type "mstsc.exe" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click Find Now. Note the folder where the Mstsc.exe file is located.

6. Close the Find window.

7. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows NT Explorer.

8. Browse to the following folder

   <WINNT>\Profiles\All Users\Start Menu Programs

   where <WINNT> is the folder in which you installed Windows NT.

9. Right-click a blank area in the right window pane, point to New, and then
   click Shortcut.

10. In the Command Line box, type the path and file name you noted in step 5, or
   click Browse to browse to the Mstsc.exe file, and then click Open.

11. At the end of the path and file name, type the following text

   "<RegistryKeyName>"

   where <RegistryKeyName> is the name of the registry key you noted in
   step 2.

12. Click Next, click Next, and then click Finish.

NOTE: If you need to configure multiple workstations, you can copy the registry
keys mentioned, using a .reg file or a Regini script. The Regini.exe tool is
available with the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit.
