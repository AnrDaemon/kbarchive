The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Embedded Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE 2.10 Enhancement Pack for Windows CE Embedded Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Platform Builder, versions 2.11, 2.12 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the PPSH or CESH connection is broken, it cannot be reestablished without
restarting the Windows CE device.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The kernel services that communicate over the PPSH or CESH connection will
timeout and disable PPSH or CESH support shortly after the connection is broken.
The kernel will not attempt to reestablish the CESH connection until the system
is restarted.

In addition, if the CESH utility is using a connection through ESHELL on the
host, and the CESH process is ended, restarting CESH will not be able to
register its service with ESHELL until the CE device is restarted.
