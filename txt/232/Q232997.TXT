SUMMARY
=======

Each server in a Windows NT Load Balancing Service (WLBS) cluster receives all
inbound requests to the Virtual IP Address (VIP). Convergence is the process in
which the servers (through a proprietary hashing algorithm) agree in advance
which server handles a given request. The decision is made based on the packet's
source IP address and possibly TCP or UDP port number (if Affinity is not used).

MORE INFORMATION
================

WLBS balances load in a statistical manner; all of the client IP:port space is
mapped to the servers as a consequence of the convergence process. Each server
is assigned parts of this space in order to achieve load distribution.

The convergence process is started when servers are added to or removed from a
cluster. Cluster integrity is monitored by the periodic exchange of heartbeats
between cluster members. When a member misses a user-defined number of
heartbeats from a server, it initiates the convergence process to form a new
cluster. When a new server is added to the cluster, the existing servers detect
the heartbeat from the new server and the convergence process is initiated.

The convergence process takes approximately three seconds, and cluster operations
continue during this time. Convergence is complete when all present hosts
exchange consistent information and a sufficient number of status messages are
exchanged.
