TITLE   :SMS: Logon Discovery in Multiple-Site Environments
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a Systems Management Server (SMS) hierarchy that contains several sites
managing a single Microsoft Windows NT domain, you should enable Logon Discovery
on only one site.

When a Logon Point receives a Data Discovery Record (DDR), it replicates that DDR
to all site servers that manage the domain.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To ensure that SMS does not create network saturation issues, disable Network
Logon Discovery for all but one site in the hierarchy. When you are using
Windows Network Logon Discovery in a multiple-site environment, this can cause a
great deal of network traffic. Symptoms of network saturation include slow
network response and possibly Error 53 ("The network path is not found") error
messages.
