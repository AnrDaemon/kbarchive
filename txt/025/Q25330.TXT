SUMMARY
=======

When you paste text to Microsoft Windows Write, the text usually appears in the
font you are using in Write. However, when you paste from one Write document to
anther Write document, the text appears in its original font.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Write "document A" is open when the text is pasted to Write "document B," the
original formatting is retained in document B. You can work around this behavior
by cutting or copying the text from Write document A, closing document A and
then pasting the text into document B. The text in the Clipboard loses its
formatting as soon as Write document A is closed. When pasting into Write
document B, the text appears in the format of that document.
