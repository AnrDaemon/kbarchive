SYMPTOMS
========

When you import ASCII text files from other word-processing programs into
Windows Write, the Write autowrap and text-justification features do not work
properly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because text files are stored in ASCII format. When creating
a document, each word processor uses its own unique control codes to indicate a
soft carriage return when autowrap is being used. When the document is converted
to an ASCII file, these control codes are changed to hard carriage returns by
convention. Therefore, these ASCII files do not autowrap or justify when
initially brought into Windows Write.

WORKAROUND
==========

For autowrap to work properly, you need to remove most of the hard carriage
returns. To do this, use the Search Change command as follows:

1. Enter ^p (^p is the Write program's control code for a hard carriage return)
   in the Find What box, and leave the Change To box empty.

2. Use the Find Next and Change buttons together (or use the Change, then the
   Find button) to selectively delete only those hard carriage returns inserted
   during the ASCII conversion. (Do not use the Change All button unless you
   want to delete all hard carriage returns in the document, including those
   marking the end of the paragraphs.)
