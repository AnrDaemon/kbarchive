SUMMARY
=======

When you run a non-Windows-based application (such as Microsoft Word for MS-DOS)
under Windows, no mouse support is available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MS-DOS-based applications running under Windows use their own mouse drivers. To
have mouse support in these applications under Windows, the mouse drivers need
to be loaded before Windows starts. In the case of Microsoft Word for MS-DOS, it
is necessary to load MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS before starting Windows. For other
applications, refer to the program and mouse manuals for the names of the
necessary drivers.
