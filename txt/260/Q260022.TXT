TITLE   :XADM: Isscan Utility Stops w. ecBadVersion w. Post-SP3 Store.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: Intel x86 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the Isscan.exe utility, which is used to aid in the removal of
virus-affected messages and attachments from the information store, against a
post-Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 version of the Store.exe file, the
Isscan utility stops responding and the following error message is displayed:

   ecBadVersion


CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the internal version of the information store is
changed with post-Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 hotfixes to the Store.exe
file (starting with build 5.5.2561.23), and this renders earlier versions of the
Isscan.exe utility incompatible.

==========
