TITLE   :XCON: Cannot Delete X.400 Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to delete an X.400 connector, you may be unable to delete it and
you receive the following error message:

   The "X.400 TCP /IP connector <connector_name> cannot be deleted because
   it is the only connector providing the mail connectivity from the local site
   to the replicated site <replicated_site_name>.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if an already existing Directory Replication connector
uses the X.400 connector to replicate both sites. This behavior functions as a
safety lock, and is designed to prevent accidental deletion of X.400 connectors
to the replicated sites.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, delete the Directory Replication connector, and then
delete the X.400 connector.

Additional query words: dirrep
