-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Offline Address Book generation process, you may receive the
following error message:

   An error occurred while generating the offline address book... ID no:c1031662

Also, you may receive the following error in the Event Viewer application log:

   Source: MSExchangeSA
   Event ID: 5004
   Description:
   Generation of the offline Address Book is complete. Result: The required MAPI
   profile cannot be created because the file MAPISVC.INF cannot be modified.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server service account does not have appropriate rights to the
Winnt/System32 folder.

Give the Service account full control rights to the System32 folder.

Administrator group on member servers, or the Domain Administrator group on
domain controllers.
