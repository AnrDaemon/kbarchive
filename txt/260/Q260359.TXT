======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Without an ON KEY LABEL in effect, no noticeable effect occurs when you issue
the following command:

   KEYBOARD "{RIGHTMOUSE}"

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, issue the following command (with the appropriate
coordinates) instead:

   MOUSE RIGHT CLICK AT MROW(), MCOL()

   -or-

   MOUSE RIGHT CLICK AT 0,0

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

At first glance, it seems as though KEYBOARD "{RIGHTMOUSE}" fails if you issue
it from the Command window. However, it is not that simple.

   ON KEY LABEL RIGHTMOUSE WAIT WINDOW "He plays the violin..."
   KEYBOARD "{RIGHTMOUSE}"

This code produces the specified message, and right-clicking the mouse also
produces the message. If you use the MOUSE RIGHT CLICK command above, the wait
window flashes briefly. When you press the context menu key on keyboards that
include it, though, it does not trigger a {RIGHTMOUSE}; instead, you get a
context menu.
