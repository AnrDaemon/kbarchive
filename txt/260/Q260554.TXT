KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Mail Server (MS Mail) and the Microsoft Mail Connector
with Exchange Server 5.5 on a computer running Windows 2000 Server, the
Async.exe program in Exchange Server may leak memory if the following conditions
exist:

 - Multiple post offices exist on the computers running MS Mail.

 - A local post office exists on Exchange Server.

 - Post offices on MS Mail are connecting to Exchange Server 5.5 by using the
   Microsoft Mail Connector.

 - Post offices on MS Mail are configured as remote post offices for each other
   as follows:

    - The post offices on MS Mail connect to post offices on Exchange Server
      directly.

    - The post offices on MS MAIL connect to post offices on MS Mail indirectly.

 - You send e-mails to some recipients on other post offices on MS Mail.

In Windows 2000 Performance Monitor, the Task List utility, and the Process
Viewer utility, an increase in memory usage is displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the method of memory management in Windows 2000
Server is different than the method that Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 uses, and the
Microsoft Mail Connector in Exchange Server 5.5 may not release the memory if it
is installed on a computer that is running Windows 2000 Server. This causes the
memory leak.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

Knowledge Base:

version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
