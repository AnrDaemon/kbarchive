TITLE   :Cannot Change Expired Domain Password When Accessing Web Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user with an expired Windows NT password tries to access a Web page on a
server that requires authentication, the browser is redirected to a password
change dialog box. Under special circumstances, the password change process
fails and the following error message occurs:

   Cannot find Server

   The page cannot be displayed

CAUSE
=====

The browser tries to open an SSL connection to the Web server to transfer the
username and password. By design, the SSL connection is enforced, because the
Windows NT account information would otherwise be exposed during the transfer to
the server. If the Web server does not allow SSL connections because no
certificate is installed, then the error message occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install a certificate on the Web site to enable SSL connections.
