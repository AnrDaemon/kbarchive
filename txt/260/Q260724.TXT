PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Public folders that are set up as calendars do not publish Free/Busy data.

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Free/Busy data is stored in a system public folder and is associated with a
mailbox. Public folders do not have mailboxes, and do not publish their
Free/Busy information.

To set up a public folder as a calendar, you must use Outlook to create the
Folder. Select Appointment Items for the "Folder contains" option during the
creation of the new folder.
