TITLE   :SMS: Variables May Not Work Properly in a Program Command Line
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbClient kbConfig kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbPackage kbSoftwareDist kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use environment variables in program command lines, the variable may
not be expanded (replaced with the actual value of the variable) before you run
the command. A non-batch file command line receives the actual environment
variable (for example, %TEMP%) rather than the actual value of the variable.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use the command line within a batch file to allow
the environment variable to be replaced with the actual value.

NOTE: This may not resolve all types of packages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2. This problem was first corrected in Systems
Management Server version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
