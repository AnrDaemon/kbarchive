TITLE   :PRB: Attempting to Print to Remote Printer Via a TCP/IP in SNA
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1 and above,4.0,4.0 SP1,4.0 SP2,4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport sna4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Print Server session is configured to print to a remote print device
through a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol. The
print session is configured when you specify either the universal naming
convention (UNC) name of the printer share or the IP address. The SNA Print
session may not respond at the pending status and the following event ID is
recorded:

   

   Event Type:	Warning
   Event Source:	SNA Virtual Print Driver
   Event Category:	None
   Event ID:	9
   Date:		4/20/2000
   Time:		3:15:03 AM
   User:		N/A
   Computer:	SNA01
   Description:
   The GDI routine OpenPrinter has returned an error to the SNA Virtual Printer Driver.<BR/>
     Error Returned: 1801.<BR/>
     Printer: \\XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

The return value of 1801 is the following printer device error:

   

   ERROR_INVALID_PRINTER_NAME

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the SNA Print Server is unable to resolve the UNC
name to the proper IP address. This is caused because of a problem with the
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server in the Windows NT domain. The SNA
Print Server does not support the configuration of the IP addresses to direct
the SNA Printer to the remote print server queue.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove the IP address entered in the printer
destination in the SNA Print session. Type in the UNC print server queue name,
and then save the configuration. Create a Lmhosts file resolving the UNC name of
the print server to the IP addresses. The Lmhosts file resolves the UNC name of
the print server to the necessary IP address until the WINS server problem has
been corrected.
