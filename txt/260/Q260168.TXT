TITLE   :SMS: Err Msg: Unable to Read Site Data from Caplist.ini File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are performing a remote Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS)
client installation, you are unable to install the SMS client software on the
remote Microsoft Windows NT computer. The Wnremote.log file from the client,
logs the following error:

   ERROR: Unable to read site data from CAP list file
   "C:\WINNT\sms_temp\caplist.ini" (-2147467259) The operation completed
   successfully.
   Error locating CAP (-2147467259) C:\WINNT\sms_temp\CCMBtLdr.exe 4/18/2000
   1:28:24 PM 235 (0xEB)
   Could not spawn CCMBoot.exe -

On the client computer, in the %windir%\sms_temp folder, the Caplist.ini file is
not present.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Caplist.ini file is not present in the
SMS\Inboxes\Clidata.src folder. Therefore, it is not being copied to the client
computer's %windir%\sms_temp folder. The client computer needs to check the
Caplist.ini file in the %windir%\sms_temp folder in order to get the information
it needs to communicate with the client access point (CAP) in order to continue
the remote installation.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, copy the Caplist.ini file from the
CAP_<XYZ>\Clidata.box folder to the SMS\Inboxes\clidata.src folder of the
CAP, where <XYZ> is the site code.
