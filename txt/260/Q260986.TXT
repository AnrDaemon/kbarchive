-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The information in this article applies to the 
Japanese version(s) of Word 97.

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, when you set Ruby in a certain form table
through a certain operation, Word 97 may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the following conditions are true:

 - You create a table that has five columns.

   -and-

 - You enter a string that contains four or more characters that are delimited
   spaces.

The problem is caused by a combination of how the EQ fields are created by the
Power97.dot file and some field update code in Word 97. Power97.dot creates the
EQ fields a bit at a time. At some stages, the fields are incomplete and
therefore invalid; however, Word still tries to update them.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
