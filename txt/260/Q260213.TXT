TITLE   :SMS: Bindery Logon Server Manager Causes Logon Problems
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) Bindery Logon Server Manager causes logon
problems if there are mapped drives in the system path. Bindery logon server
runs the LoadLibrary function looking for a Novell NetWare redirector at the
start of every update cycle. This occurs if bindery support is installed on the
site, regardless of whether the Bindery logon point is created.

If there is a network resource in the system path to which the SMSService account
does not access rights, the system may experience poor performance and a
possible SMSService account lockout on the remote system.

CAUSE
=====

SMS Bindery Logon Server Manager tries to load the Microsoft NetWare
dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) and the Novell NetWare DLLs by using the
LoadLibrary function.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use the appropriate method:

 - Load the Novell NetWare DLLs only from the local computer (the %SystemRoot%
   folder or the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder). Do not use the default behavior
   of the LoadLibrary function. The network abstraction layer (NAL) may search
   the network drive for network DLLs. This may lead to increased network
   traffic. To work around this behavior, remove network drives from the path.

 - If the Novell NetWare DLLs do not work, load only the Microsoft NetWare DLLs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
