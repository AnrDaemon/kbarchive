 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX version 2.0 Administrator
tool, you may receive the following error message:

   Internet Explorer Script Error

   An error has occurred in the script on this page.

   Line: 60
   Char: 5
   Error: Automation server can't create object
   Code: 0

   Do you want to continue running scripts on this page?

NOTE: The information in the URL line of the error message is the path to the
script, and varies depending on your computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you install Services for UNIX in a folder whose name
contains a space or spaces. This also occurs if the folder name contain a tilde
(~) character.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install Services for UNIX in a folder whose name does not
contain a space, for example, C:\Sfu, or a tilde (~) character.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can easily detect this problem by reviewing the URL value in the error
message. For example:

   C:\Program Files\UnixSvcs\Admin\About.htm

The Program Files folder name contains a space and causes the error message.

This behavior is also described in the Services for UNIX 2.0 Readme.txt file:

   Special Requirements and Alerts

   Install this software in a directory that does not include a space (or tilde)
   in its name. If you do install this software in a directory that has a space
   (or tilde) in its name, some shortcuts cannot work correctly. In addition,
   you may experience problems with Network File System (NFS), some UNIX
   utilities, and scripts.
