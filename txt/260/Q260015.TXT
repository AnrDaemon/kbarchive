TITLE   :PC DirSync: Dispatch Does Not Work on Windows 2000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.x
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Dispatch program runs until it tries to initiate NSDA to start the directory
synchronization (dirsync) process. Then the Dispatch program stops, and
generates an OS/2 subsystem error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, run a forcedos command that precedes the normal command
line, for example:

   forcedos dispatch -dmo

MORE INFORMATION
================

You are attempting to start a bound MS-DOS-based OS/2 application. This
application uses an unsupported OS/2 application programming interface (API),
and therefore cannot be started by the OS/2 subsystem. After the application
stops, you can try to restart it by using the forcedos command, because the
MS-DOS-based subsystem supports the application.
