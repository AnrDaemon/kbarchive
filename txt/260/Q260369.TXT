TITLE   :PRB: Err Msg "Can't Load DLL '?????L?' " Running Deployed App

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you deploy an application that uses the CreateWorkspace method to create an
Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) WorkSpace, the application raises one of the
following errors:

   Run-time Error '3633' Can't load DLL "?????L?"

   -or-

   Run-time Error '3633' Can't load DLL "MSRDO20.DLL"

CAUSE
=====

When the call to CreateWorkspace creates an ODBC WorkSpace, it uses ODBCDirect,
which is dependent on the Remote Data Objects (RDO) Msrdo20.dll file. Because
there is no actual Reference to ODBCDirect in the project (just the type of call
that is made in code), the Package & Deployment Wizard (PDW) does not know
to include the Msrdo20.dll file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the Msrdo20.dll file to the Package. There are two different methods to
accomplish this when running the PDW:

1. If you are presented with a DAO Drivers screen, move ODBCDirect over to the
   Included Drivers column. This includes the Msrdo20.dll file.

2. From the Included Files screen, click the Add button and manually add the
   Msrdo20.dll file to the Package.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
