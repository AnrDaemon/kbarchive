TITLE   :XADM: Mailbox Manager Stops Responding Clicking the Policies Tab
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access the Policies tab in Mailbox Manager, the information
is not displayed and you do not receive an error message or any response from
the Exchange Administrator program.

CAUSE
=====

When you create a recipient container object in an invalid location in the
Exchange hierarchy, the .dll file for mailbox manager is unable to display any
valid recipient containers on the Policies tab. Because the Exchange
Administrator program has more strict rules than the Exchange Server directory,
the object cannot be created by the Exchange Administrator program. You can,
however, create the object by using a client such as a writeable Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) client or third-party Directory Application
Programming Interface (DAPI) utility.

RESOLUTION
==========

To get a response back from the Mailbox Manager program, you must remove the
invalid object. It may be possible to remove this object with the Exchange
Administrator program, but it may be necessary to use the utility that created
the object.
