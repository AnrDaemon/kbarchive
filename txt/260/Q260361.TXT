TITLE   :TCP/IP Protocol Is Missing from Network Tool in Control Panel
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may not be able to add the TCP/IP protocol because the TCP/IP protocol is
not listed in the Select Network Protocol dialog box in the Network tool in
Control Panel.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Oemnxptc.inf file is missing from the
%SystemRoot%\System32 folder, or if the Oemnxptc.inf registry key and values are
missing under the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Ncpa\InfOptions

This issue can occur if you accidentally delete the Oemnxptc.inf file. If you
delete the file, the registry key is also deleted automatically when you start
the Network tool in Control Panel.

RESOLUTION
==========

Manually expand the Oemnxptc.in_ file from your original Windows NT CD-ROM to
Oemnxptc.inf in the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder. If this does not resolve the
problem, you may need to add both the Oemnxptc.inf file and the registry key
manually. If that does not resolve the problem, you must reinstall Windows NT.
