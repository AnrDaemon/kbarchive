TITLE   :HEAD Request Returns Both Header and Body
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWin2000SP2Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you map an extension to Ssinc.dll to use server-side include files, if you
send a HEAD request for such a mapped file to the Web server, the request
returns both header and body rather than just the header.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Ssinc.dll does not recognize the HEAD request.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add the HEAD request type to the "exclusion" list
in the Application mapping properties of the Web site. The problem no longer
occurs because the Web server (not Ssinc.dll) handles the verb checking.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
