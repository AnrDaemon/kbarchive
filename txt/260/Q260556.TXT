TITLE   :Can't Associate NT Accounts with Exchange Mailboxes with LDAP MA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to associate a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 account with a
Microsoft Exchange mailbox by means of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) Management Agent (MA), a mailbox is created and the Assoc-NT-Account
attribute is populated. However, the mailbox is not created correctly. When you
try to view the mailbox properties, the following error message is displayed on
your computer screen:

   The parameter is incorrect. Microsoft Windows NT ID no. 0xc0020057.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur because the Exchange LDAP Management Agent does not have
the built-in option that can associate an Exchange mailbox with a Windows NT
account. This feature is only available for the MAPI Management Agent.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, use the Exchange MAPI Management Agent instead of the
Exchange LDAP Management Agent.
