TITLE   :XFOR: Event ID 5016 from the GroupWise Calendar Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to view the Free/Busy information of a Novell GroupWise user,
you may receive the following event in the application log:

   Event ID: 5016
   Source: MSExchangeGWiseCal
   Description:
   Could not receive a returning probe message. Please make sure both Microsoft
   Exchange Router for Novell GroupWise service and GroupWise API Gateway are
   running. Probe message checking, Continue.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because of an error in the configuration of the
Microsoft Exchange Calendar Connector. The Calendar Connector is configured to
point to a GroupWise domain (a format of domain.gateway).

GroupWise supports having multiple domains within a GroupWise environment. In
many cases, the connector for mail flow resides in a domain separate from the
domain for GroupWise users. The Calendar Connector must point to the domain
where the users reside.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, modify the Calendar Connector to point to the
domain where the GroupWise users reside.
