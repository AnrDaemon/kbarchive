   Title: Microsoft Site Server Analysis

   Whois did not return any results. Please check that the local domain of your
   DNS server is specified correctly under options, IP servers. After importing
   data, IP resolution should be performed before performing whois.
   It took 23 seconds.

CAUSE
=====

InterNIC changed the WHOIS servers from whois.internic.net to
whois.networksolutions.com. Because UIMPORT.exe is hard coded to look
specifically at whois.internic.net, most WHOIS lookups fail as of November 30,
1999.

==========

Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
