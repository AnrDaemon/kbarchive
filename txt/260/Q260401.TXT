TITLE   :XADM: Install Doesn't Work on Stand-Alone Windows 2000 Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::2000,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Exchange Server 5.5 on a stand-alone Windows 2000
Server-based computer, the following error message may be displayed:

   This computer must belong to a Windows NT domain before Microsoft Exchange
   can be installed.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the computer that you want to install Exchange
Server on must be a member of either a Microsoft Windows NT or Windows 2000
domain, and cannot be part of a workgroup.

A stand-alone server, by definition, is a computer that runs Windows 2000 Server
but does not participate in a domain. A stand-alone server has only its own
database of users, and it processes logon requests by itself. It does not share
account information with any other computer and cannot provide access to domain
accounts.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, add your Windows 2000 Server to an existing Windows NT
4.0 or Windows 2000 domain:

1. On the desktop, right-click My Computer.

2. On the Network Identification tab, click Properties.

3. Under Member Of, click Domain.

4. Type the name of the domain that you want to join.

   NOTE: You may be prompted for the user name and password of an account that
   has permissions to join the domain.

5. Click OK.

6. A message is displayed that states the following:

   Welcome to the <your_domain_name> domain.

7. Click OK. You are prompted to restart the server to complete the process of
   joining the domain.

If you want to create a new domain with your Windows 2000 Server-based computer,
you can run the dcpromo command (click Start, and then click Run). For
additional information about the Dcpromo utility and the Windows 2000 Active
Directory, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
