If two or more clients on a Terminal Server attempt to gain access to a resource

point, the terminal server may stop responding (hang).

A deadlock can occur between the Dfs client and the redirector on a Terminal
Server if two clients on the same Terminal Server try to gain access to the same
remote Dfs resource at the same time.
