TITLE   :Error Message Generated when Exporting Foreign Users to Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool MMS

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the Microsoft Exchange LDAP management Agent, you may receive the
following error message in the operator's log during the process of Updating the
Connected Directory's Foreign Users

   Invalid addition response: 21 - INVALID ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX for object
   cn=<user name>,cn=Exchangecontainer,cn=recipients,ou=site,o=org

where <user name> is a name with an apostrophe, such as John O'Neil.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the templates use a $unquote() function with the
second parameter set to 1. Because of this, quotation marks and apostrophes are
removed. When a name contains an apostrophe (for example, O'Neil), the
apostrophe is removed from the Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) but the
Distinguished Name (DN) still contains the apostrophe. The problem occurs
because Exchange needs the RDN and the DN of the entry to match exactly. When
these values do not match, the user is not permitted to be imported and the
error message is recorded in the operator's log.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, edit the Crt.st file and the Exp.st file by changing the
value of the second parameter of the $unquote() function from 1 to 0:

1. Select the MA where the problem is occurring.

2. Click Properties to view the Properties dialog box.

3. Click the Record Templates tab.

4. Click "Record this MA's templates to it's Working Directory".

5. In the MA's working directory, edit the following files:

   Crt.st
   Exp.st

   Change the following syntax from

   "$v_rdn = $unquote($v_rdn, 1)"

   to

   "$v_rdn = $unquote($v_rdn, 0)"

   NOTE: If you are unfamiliar with the storage locations of the template files
   listed above, click the "Intermediate Files and Logs" tab in Management Agent
   Properties. The files and their locations are located in the Working
   Directory tab.

6. Click to select the ""Update this MA from its working directory's templates
   located at: DirPath"." check box in the properties of the Management Agent
   Recording Template tab.

7. Click Update Management Agent on the Action Panel to update the management
   agent based on the templates you modified in the working directory.

8. Click Operate MA, run the MA again, and then check the operator logs to
   verify that the error message is not generated.
