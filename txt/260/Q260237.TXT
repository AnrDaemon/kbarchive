SUMMARY
=======

PicClip.exe is a sample that demonstrates how to use an ActiveX PictureClip
control to select an area from a source bitmap and display the image in an
ActiveX FoxHWND control (FoxHWND.ocx). By using the PictureClip control
(PicClp32.ocx), the user can select a specific area from a source bitmap as an
object that can then be passed to another control that is capable of accepting
an object reference.

The PictureClip control provides an efficient mechanism for storing multiple
picture resources in a single bitmap file. Instead of using multiple bitmaps or
icons, you need to create a source bitmap that contains all of the bitmap images
that are required by your application. When you need to display an individual
bitmap, use the PictureClip control to select the region in the source bitmap
that contains the portion of the bitmap that you need.

You can specify the clipping region in the source bitmap in one of two ways:

 - Select any portion of the source bitmap as the clipping region. Specify the
   upper-left corner of the clipping region by using the ClipX and ClipY
   properties. Specify the area of the clipping region by using the ClipHeight
   and ClipWidth properties. This method is useful when you want to view a
   random portion of a bitmap.

 - Divide the source bitmap into a specified number of rows and columns. The
   result is a uniform matrix of picture cells numbered 0, 1, 2, and so on. You
   can then display individual cells by using the GraphicCell property. This
   method is useful when the source bitmap contains a palette of icons that you
   want to display individually, such as in a toolbar bitmap.

Because the PictureClip control returns an object rather than a Bitmap, an image
control cannot be used to display the selected area of the source bitmap. To
display the selected area of the source bitmap, use a FoxHWND control to accept
and display the object.
