TITLE   :SMS: Multiple Advertisements May Not Work If One Is Unscheduled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you schedule multiple advertisements and then unschedule one of the multiple
advertisements in the Administrator console, the client receives an "Unable to
connect to the server... You can't schedule any programs to run at this time"
error message, and no advertisements run on the client workstation.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if multiple programs are advertised to run on a client and
the administrator unschedules one of the advertisements in the Administrator
console while the client is running the Advertised Programs Wizard and is
viewing the list of available programs. If the client schedules all the
advertisements to run, the error message is displayed and no programs are run.

WORKAROUND
==========

Cancel the selection of the unscheduled advertisement in the Advertised Programs
Wizard, or quit and restart the Advertised Programs Wizard to refresh the
advertisement list.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
