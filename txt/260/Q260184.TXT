MORE INFORMATION
================

In Exchange Administrator, you can add a Storage Limits column under the mailbox

for each particular user, and reports the users status according to the limits.
The following list defines the limits that are used in the Storage Limits
column:

 - No Checking:
   Mailbox limits are not enabled for this mailbox.

 - Below Limit:
   Mailbox has limits set, but the mailbox is below all set limits.

 - Issue Warning:
   Mailbox has reached the Issue Warning limit and a warning message is delivered
   to the mailbox.

 - Prohibit Send:
   Mailbox has reached the Prohibit Send limit and is no longer able to send
   messages.

 - Mailbox Disabled:
   Mailbox has reached the Prohibit Send and Receive limit and is now set to
   Disabled. You are not able to send messages from this mailbox, and this
   mailbox is unable to receive messages.

To add the Storage Limits column to mailboxes:

1. Start the Exchange Administrator.

2. Browse to the Servers container.

3. Click to expand the server.

4. Click to expand Private information store.
