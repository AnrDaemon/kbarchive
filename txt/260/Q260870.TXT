TITLE   :Restrict Anonymous Prevents Discovery of Windows NT 4.0 Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1,2.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services versions 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Discovery of a Microsoft Windows NT domain is performed, it may not
work. Also, the operator's log may contain the following error messages:

   Failed to list users for domain <domain name>
   Error: Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.

   Failed to enumerate groups for domain <domain name>.
   Error: Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.
   Discovered 0 groups
   Failed to list local groups for domain <domain name>.
   Error: Access is denied.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the primary domain controller (PDC) of the target
Windows NT 4.0 domain has the RestrictAnonymous registry parameter enabled, and
the MMS service is running in the context of the local system account.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue if in the same domain or a domain trusted by the Windows
NT 4.0 domain, start the service by using an account that is a member of the
administrators group in the domain, or run the Viaserver process as a console
program from the command line while you are logged on as a member of the
administrators group.

To work around this issue in the event that the MMS server is not a member of the
Windows NT 4.0 domain or a trusted domain, log on to the computer that is
running MMS by using a parallel local or domain account that uses the same user
name and password as an account in the administrators group on the Windows NT
4.0 domain and start the Viaserver process as a console program from the command
line.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the local system account is used by the MMS service, it attempts to make an
anonymous connection to the target PDC to enumerate users and groups in the
Windows NT 4.0 domain.

The list of users and groups cannot be obtained through an anonymous connection
when the RestrictAnonymous setting is enabled. For additional information about
