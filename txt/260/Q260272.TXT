KEYWORDS:kbtool kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MapPoint 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to link or import data from a data source that contains more
than 2000 records to Microsoft MapPoint 2001, your computer may stop responding
(hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions are true:

 - You attempt to link to or import more than 2000 records.

 - The records that you link or import include specific information such as
   street addresses.

Note: MapPoint 2002 has increased the allowable imported records to 10,000.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Make sure that the data source from which you link or import data contains a
   maximum of 2000 records.

 - Do not include street addresses in the records that you link or import.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can map all of the records from a data source that contains over 2000
records by using geographic information that is less specific than street
addresses, such as postal codes.
