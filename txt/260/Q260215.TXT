TITLE   :XADM: Setup Fails on Windows 2000 Cluster
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Exchange Server 5.5 on a Microsoft Windows 2000
cluster server, Setup fails when it attempts to start services and you receive
the following error message:

   Overlapped I/O operation is in progress.

   ID no: 0xc00203e5

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server service account does not have the required permissions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, add the Exchange Server service account to the local
Power Users group or local Administrators group on a member server. On a domain
controller, add the account to the built-in Administrators group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The minimum rights necessary for the Exchange Server service account on a member
server are Power Users rights. However, if installation problems occur when you
use the local Power Users group, add the Exchange Server service account to the
local Administrators group. Also, if the local Power Users group is not
available because of the type of installation that was performed, use the local
Administrators group.
