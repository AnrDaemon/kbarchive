SYMPTOMS
========

When you are attempting to make a dial-up networking connection on a Lotus Notes
server, you receive the following error message:

   Error 633: The port is in use or not configured for Remote Access Dial-Out.

CAUSE
=====

When the Lotus Notes client is configured to use one of the Component Object
Model (COM) ports, Lotus Notes takes control of that COM port and prevents the
remote access server (RAS) from gaining access for subsequent dial-out sessions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent the Lotus Notes client from taking control of the COM port, follow
these steps:

1. Start the Lotus Notes client on the server.

2. On the File menu, click Tools. On the Notes menu, click User Preferences.

   This opens the User Preferences dialog box where you can configure which ports
   the Lotus Notes client uses.

3. Click Ports, select the COM port that the RAS service is using, and then
   clear the Port Enabled option.

This ensures that the Lotus Notes client running on the server does not grab the
COM port before the RAS dial-out client.
