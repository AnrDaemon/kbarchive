======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open the Public Folders or System Folders containers in the
Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, the following error message may
be displayed:

   The attempt to log on to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer has failed.

   Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store
   ID no: 8004011d-0512-00000000

In Microsoft Outlook, when users attempt to expand the public folder hierarchy,
the users may receive the following error message:

   Unable to expand the folder. The set of folders could not be opened. The
   attempt to log on to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer has failed.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Exchange Server computer that you are connected to
in the Administrator program points to another server as the public folder
server, and the Public Information Store object has been removed from the
Administrator program of that other server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. In the Private Information Store properties of the server that is receiving
   the error message, click the General tab, and then click to select the
   "Public folder server" check box. This check box is most likely clear.

2. Click another server in the list, and then apply this change.

3. After you make the change, quit and then restart the Administrator program.
