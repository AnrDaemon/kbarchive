TITLE   :XADM: Exchange Categorization Count Displays 4294967296
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix kbgraphxlinkcritical kbExchange2000SP1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows NT Performance Monitor may display a value of 4294967296 when
you view the Categorization Count counter for the MSExchangeIS Private or
MSExchangeIS Public objects. When you restart the information store, this count
starts at a value of 0.


CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the information store allows this counter to become
negative. Performance Monitor displays the value 4294967296 for negative numbers
(the hexadecimal equivalent to 0x100000000). The value for the Categorization
Count counter should reflect the total number of categorization tables in the
private and public information stores, and this count should be preserved when
you restart the information store. Preservation of this number is not being
handled properly.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
