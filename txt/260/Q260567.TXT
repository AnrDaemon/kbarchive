TITLE   :BUG: LNK2019 When Building For Pocket PC Emulation
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbGrpDSETK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When building an application for Pocket PC emulation that uses the Windows CE
operating system functions, errors similar to the following may be encountered:

   <filename>.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol
   _CeDeleteDatabase referenced in function <function>

CAUSE
=====

These operating system functions use the _stdcall calling convention, but the
compiler is declaring them as _cdecl. This problem occurs with the Windows CE
Platform SDK for Pocket PC because the functions are incorrectly declared in the
Windbase.h file without a linkage type.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following workarounds:

 - Add the /Gz compiler switch to the configuration's project settings when
   building for Pocket PC emulation.

-or-

 - If the first workaround prevents other functions/libraries from linking in
   your project, then modify the Windows CE database function declarations in
   the Windbase.h file. For example, for the error in the "Symptoms" section,
   change the following declaration

   BOOL CeDeleteDatabase (CEOID oid);

   to read:

   BOOL WINAPI CeDeleteDatabase (CEOID oid);

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This bug affects the following function classes:

 - Windows CE Database
