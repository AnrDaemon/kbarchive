MORE INFORMATION
================

The PGC Migration Wizard is part of the SMS 2.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) CD-ROM
because an updated SMS Provider is needed with SP1. You can use the PGC
Migration Wizard from SP1 after you upgrade your site to SP2.

In addition, the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit tools Tlist.exe,
Pviewer.exe, and Depends.exe are not included on the SMS 2.0 SP2 CD-ROM. You can
find these tools on the SMS 2.0 SP1 CD-ROM or the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
Resource Kit.
