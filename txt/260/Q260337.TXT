SUMMARY
=======

The Sleep application program interface (API), causes the current program to
suspend execution for a specified number of milliseconds. This is useful when
you need to pause code execution in a DLL or multi-threaded DLL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Since you can not have an interface in a DLL, you can not use a WAIT or =INKEY
function. The following code shows you how to declare the Sleep API and then how
to call the Sleep API.

The number you pass to the API is in milliseconds.

   DECLARE Integer Sleep IN Win32API Integer
   =Sleep(5000)      && Pause for 5 seconds

NOTE: APIs are case sensitive. So, make sure that you type the command exactly as
shown.
