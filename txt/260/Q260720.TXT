SUMMARY
=======

When you troubleshoot communication problems in online games, you may need to
create a Modemlog.txt file. The Modemlog.txt file records a log of your
communication sessions.

This article describes how to create a Modemlog.txt file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, please consult your
product documentation to complete these steps.

To create a Modemlog.txt file:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Modems.

3. On the General tab, click the modem that you are using.

4. Click Properties.

5. Click the Connection tab.

6. Click Advanced.

7. Click to select the "Record a Log File" check box, and then click OK.

8. Click OK, and then click Close.

9. Close Control Panel.

The Modemlog.txt file is now created when you use your modem in any program that
relies upon the Windows Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI). The
Modemlog.txt file is located inside the Windows folder.

NOTE: If the "Record a Log File" check box is already selected, you need to
rename the existing Modemlog.txt file to record a log of only one communication
session.

To rename the Modemlog.txt file:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files or Folders."

2. In the Named box, type "modemlog.txt" (without the quotation marks).

3. In the "Look in" box, click My Computer, and then click Find Now.

4. In the list of found files, right-click the Modemlog.txt file, and then click
   Rename.

5. Type "modemlog.old" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

6. Close the Find: Files Named Modemlog.txt window.
