The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

The KEYBOARD command allows the {PAUSE nSeconds} option to be placed in a
keyboard buffer along with the documented key labels. This option results in a
pause of nSeconds in Visual FoxPro 5.0x and 6.0x. In Visual FoxPro 3.0x, it does
not result in a syntax error, but does not pause.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Command window, type:

"KEYBOARD '{PAUSE 5}'" (without the quotation marks)

and note that the cursor disappears from the Command window for five seconds
before returning when running Visual FoxPro 5.0x or 6.0x.

For more information on the KEYBOARD command, please see the Visual FoxPro
Language Reference.
