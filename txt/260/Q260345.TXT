The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you perform an installation of Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional with the
Brazillian OEM Preinstall Kit (OPK), the channel screen saver does not work.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a temporary workaround you can:

1. Start the screen saver. When the computer stops responding (hangs), press
   CTRL+ALT+DEL to open the Task Manager.

2. In the Windows Task Manager dialog box, click the Processes tab. Locate the
   exact screen saver file that is being run for the channel saver (it is
   PROTEI~1.SCR).

3. Find that .scr file and rename it to a different name.

Note that now the name in the drop-down combo box of the Screen Saver tab has
also changed. The screen saver will now work correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

After a complete installation of Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional (Brazilian)
OPK:

1. Select the Screen Saver tab in the Display Applet of Control Panel.

2. In the drop-down combo box for selecting the screen saver, choose "Proteo de
   tela do canal". This is the default Microsoft Internet Explorer channel
   screen saver.

3. Click Visualizar or the Preview button.

The cursor flickers but the screen saver never starts.
