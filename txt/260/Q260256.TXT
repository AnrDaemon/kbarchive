TITLE   :Java Plug-in Leaves Browser Processes and NTVDMs Running
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0 SP6
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty msient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: Intel x86 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: Intel x86 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Programs such as Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer 5, and
RealPlayer, as well as 16-bit programs running NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM),
may continue to use process resources after you close the programs. You must
then use Task Manager to quit the process; otherwise, the operating system
memory eventually runs out of resources and you need to restart the computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because Java Plug-in version 1.2.1 leaves orphaned
browser processes open after the browser is closed. This behavior does not seem
to occur when you browse Web sites or applets that do not use the Java plug-in.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, download and install Java Plug-in 1.2.2 from the
following Web site:

   http:java.sun.com
