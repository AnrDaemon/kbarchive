SYMPTOMS
========

When you install or reinstall Outlook Web Access (OWA) you may receive the
following error message:

   Access Denied Microsoft Windows NT ID no: 0xc0020005

The following event may also be logged in the application event log of the
Windows NT Event Viewer.

   Event ID: 14, Source: W3SVC, description: "exchfilt.dll could not be loaded."

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if a folder or file is corrupted. It can also be
the result of a locked file, a lack of appropriate permissions, or a service
that does not stop or start.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Because there is more than one possible cause for this error message, to resolve
this issue perform the following steps (these are steps that have resolved this
issue in the past):

1. Stop any unnecessary services. These include, but are not limited to:
   antivirus software, backup software, and any third-party Internet-related
   services.

2. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, make sure that the permissions
   for the Organization, Site, and Site Configuration containers are sufficient.
   Generally there is an Administrator account that has Permissions
   Administrator rights and a Site Service account that has Service Account
   Administrator rights. Make sure that there are no unnecessary entries, such
   as a user or group that has Search rights.

3. Make sure that you are logged on with an account that has Administrator
   rights to the domain and at least Permissions Administrator rights in
   Exchange Server. (To test permissions, try to stop and start the World Wide
   Web Publishing service manually.)

4. Look for an Exchsrvr\Webdata folder. If one exists, back up any customized
   Active Server Pages (ASP) files, and then delete this folder.

5. Locate a Exchsrvr\Webtemp folder; if one exists, delete it.

6. Locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeWEB

   If this key exists, back the key up, and then use Registry Editor to delete
   the key.

7. Locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup\Web Connector

   If this key exists, back the key up, and then use Registry Editor to delete
   the key.

8. Use the Add/Remove option in your Exchange Server Setup program to reinstall
   Outlook Web Access.
