======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When making changes to the Notifications tab in the properties dialog of the
Available Programs Client Agent in Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0, the
settings are not propagated to existing clients. These settings are also not
updated on the clients even after they complete their next 23-hour ccim32
cycle.

To verify this, you can open the Advertised Programs Monitor applet within
Control Panel on the client, and select Options... from the System menu. This
problem does not affect new clients. New clients reflect the current site
settings when they are installed.

CAUSE
=====

This can occur if the "Client cannot change settings" option is not enabled. To
verify the status of this setting, view the General tab of the Available
Programs Client Agent Properties dialog within the Client Agents node of the SMS
Administrator Console.

WORKAROUND
==========

To force the settings in the SMS Administrator Console to take effect for
existing clients, enable the "Clients cannot change agent settings" check box in
the Advertised Programs Client Agent properties.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
