PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you change the display name for a mailbox, the Mailbox column under
Mailbox Resources in the Exchange Administration program still displays the old
display name for the mailbox.

CAUSE
=====

When you update the Display Name field in the mailbox Properties dialog box, the
change is made to the mailbox entry in the Exchange directory (the dir.edb
file). The corresponding change to the mailbox object in the Exchange
Information Store (the priv.edb file) is not made until one of the following
events occurs:

 - The client logs on to the mailbox.

   -or-

 - A message is sent to the mailbox.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, log on to the mailbox as a client to update the Mailbox
column in Mailbox Resources, or send a test message to the mailbox.
