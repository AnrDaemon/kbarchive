TITLE   :FIX: Forward Reference to Segment Name Gives Phase Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1,5.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.1, 5.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A forward reference to a segment name in the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)
versions 5.0, 5.1, and 5.1a will incorrectly cause the following error to occur

   error A2006: phase error between passes

RESOLUTION
==========

A workaround is to declare empty segments at the top of your MASM source code,
defining all segments in the order needed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 5.1 and 5.1a. This
problem was corrected in MASM version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following source example demonstrates the problem. As a work around, place
the following code fragment at the top of the source file.

         CSEG segment para public 'CODE'
         CSEG ends
         SSEG segment stack 'STACK'
         SSEG ends

Because the sseg segment is declared before the MOV instruction references it,
the phase error is eliminated. The cseg segment is also declared to ensure that
the ordering of the two segments is unchanged.

Note that this problem does not occur with MASM 6.0 or later since phase errors
are only generated by two pass assemblers and MASM 6.0 and later are N-pass
assemblers.

Sample Code:
------------

   ;Assemble options needed: none

   cseg SEGMENT para public 'CODE'
        assume cs:cseg

   main PROC near
        MOV bx, seg sseg               ;will generate phase error
        RET
   main ENDP

   cseg ENDS

   sseg SEGMENT stack 'STACK'
        db 100h dup(?)
   sseg ENDS

   END main
