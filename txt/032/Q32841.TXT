SUMMARY
=======

An application developed with one of the Microsoft compilers above stores
bitfields from low memory to high memory. For example, consider the following
declaration:

   struct x {
      unsigned field_one:3;
      unsigned field_two:9;
      unsigned field_three:5;
   };

Compiled with a 16-bit compiler, the above code stores field_one in bits 0- 2 of
the first word, field_two in bits 3-11 of the same word, and field_three in bits
0-4 of the next word (because the field cannot fit in the remaining four bits of
the first word and bit fields do not cross byte boundaries). Compiled with a
32-bit compiler, the same code stores the struct in the 17 least significant
bits of a word.
