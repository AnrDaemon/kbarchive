Version 5.10 of the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) includes a new command-line
option, /LA, which adds all code generated by the assembler to the listing
file.

given as an option by the command masm /help.

The command-line option /LA displays the results of the simplified segment
directives and code generated by the high-level language support features. The
following is a sample source file with simplified segment directives and a
