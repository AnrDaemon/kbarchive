SUMMARY
=======

If you try to delete the entire contents of a directory, MS-DOS prompts you to
verify the operation. While this helps protect you against inadvertently erasing
a large number of files, it also forces you to go through two steps to perform a
single operation. The experienced MS-DOS user can place the following command in
a batch file in order to make available the option of deleting the contents of
directory in one step:

   echo y | del %1\*.*

If the above line is placed in a batch file called, for example, DELALL.BAT, you
can then tell MS-DOS to delete all the files in the current working directory by
invoking the batch file as follows:

   " delall . " (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: This example may want to include more error checking, since invoking this
batch file and forgetting to provide the %1 argument would delete all of the
files in the root directory.

If you are using MS-DOS 6 or later, you can simply use the DELTREE program. For
more information on DELTREE, type "help deltree" (without the quotation marks)
at the MS-DOS 6.x command prompt and then press ENTER.
