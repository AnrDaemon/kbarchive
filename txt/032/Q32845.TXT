SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses switch settings for the IBM Token-Ring Network PC
Adapter.

The following are switch-configurable parameters for the Token Ring adapter and
conflicts that may occur:

1. The Interrupt Line address may conflict with devices such as the Microsoft
   Bus Mouse, hard drive controllers, serial and parallel ports.

2. The Base I/O address may conflict with expanded memory boards.

3. The Memory Map Address may conflict with the memory addresses used by
   expanded memory board drivers, 3270 cards, ESDI hard-drive controllers, and
   display adapters.

It may be necessary to change switch settings on the Token Ring Adapter and/or
other cards in the system to avoid such conflicts.
