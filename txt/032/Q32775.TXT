======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

A copy of the ground terrain appears on the screen every 215,000 feet, causing
the "phantom airports" that are seen in the sky at high altitudes.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Versions 3.00 and 4.00. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view these phantom airports, do the following (this demonstration assumes you
are at Chicago's Meigs Field, runway 36):

1. Press "5" on the main keyboard for the NAV/COM menu.

2. Press "9" on the main keyboard to turn on Slew Mode.

3. Press "A" for Position Set.

4. Enter 215900 in the Altitude field.

5. Press the SPACEBAR to exit the menus.

After this process is completed, you should be 200-300 feet above the "Phantom"
Chicago Meigs airport. Flying is much the same (you can still crash into
buildings, etc.), except that you can also fly under the ground.

As soon as the altimeter drops below zero, however, the airplane will react as if
it is flying at 215,000 feet again and begin to fall through the "thin"
atmosphere. These phantom cities remain visible until the airplane drops below
108,000 feet.
