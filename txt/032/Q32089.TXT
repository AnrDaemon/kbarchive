The following are Nondirectional Beacon (NDB) instructions:

1. Set the Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) to the NDB frequency. The NDB
   frequencies are given in the README.DOC file for Flight Simulator version
   3.00 and documented on the maps for Flight Simulator version 4.00. To obtain
   the maps for Flight Simulator Version 4.00, contact Microsoft Customer
   Service at (800) 426-9400.

2. Turn the airplane so that the needle on the ADF instrument points to zero.
   Flying straight will keep you on course to the NDB beacon.
