Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

When multiple instances of the MAZE application are started, MAZE draws a
bouncing ball in the client area of one of its instances. MAZE creates a DDE
communications link between instances of the MAZE application and uses this link
to pass the ball to other instances at random. MAZE also creates a DDE
conversation with Excel and passes statistical information about the ball to
Excel.

MAZE demonstrates how to use DDE to pass information between applications and how
to use PeekMessage to allow other applications to run simultaneously with a
process-intensive task.
