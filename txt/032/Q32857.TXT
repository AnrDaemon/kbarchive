-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Beginning with MS-DOS Version 3.30, BACKUP, when used with the /A option,
prompts you to insert the last disk of the backup set into the target drive. In
previous versions of BACKUP, there was no such prompt.

The reason for this prompt is to ensure that the last diskette in the series is
in the drive. Trying to append anything but the last disk in the series may
cause problems.

Additional query words: 3.30 3.30a 4.00 5.00 5.00a
