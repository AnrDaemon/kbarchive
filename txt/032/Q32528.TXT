SUMMARY
=======

In Flight Simulator Versions 3.00 and 4.00, a beeping noise is emitted as soon
as you come inside the outer airport marker to which you have tuned the NAV
radio for the airport's ILS frequency.

You can turn off the sound by pressing the "Q" key. This will turn off all sound,
including engine noise, until the "Q" key is pressed again.
