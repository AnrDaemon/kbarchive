SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft C and C/C++ compiler command lines can include files with the
.DEF, .LIB, and .OBJ filename extensions.

If you specify one or more of these files on the command line, the CL driver
passes them appropriately as arguments to LINK.EXE. If the name of a file does
not have an extension, CL treats it as a .OBJ file and appropriately passes it
to the linker.

The following command line builds an application called MYAPP.EXE by compiling
MYAPP.C into MYAPP.OBJ, then linking MYAPP.OBJ and MYSUB.OBJ with the MYLIB.LIB
library and the MYDEF.DEF module definition file:

   cl myapp.c mysub mylib.lib mydef.def

Additional query words: 8.00 8.00c 9.00
