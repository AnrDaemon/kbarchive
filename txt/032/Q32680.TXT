The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The ValidateFreeSpaces() function does not work as documented on page 4-454 of
the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Reference Volume 1" for version
3.0. On page 964 of the "Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions" manual
from the Windows 3.1 SDK, the ValidateFreeSpaces() function is correctly
documented.

MORE INFORMATION
================

ValidateFreeSpaces() returns a void, not a LPSTR, as documented. Under the
debugging kernel, ValidateFreeSpaces() will RIP if it finds overwritten free
space; under the retail kernel, it does nothing.

To use ValidateFreeSpaces(), the WIN.INI file must include the following
statements:

   [KERNEL]
   EnableHeapChecking=1
   EnableFreeChecking=1

If an application calls ValidateFreeSpaces() and it discovers an error, it will
RIP with a fatal exit code of 0x00ff, "FREE MEMORY OVERWRITE AT," and the
address of the byte that was overwritten as Segment:Offset.

To build a fairly solid detector of wild pointers, an application writer can use
the following statements in the [KERNEL] section:

1. EnableHeapChecking=1 to cause the kernel to regularly check the global arena.

2. EnableFreeChecking=1 to let ValidateFreeSpaces() check global free space.

3. EnableSegmentChecksum=1 to cause the kernel to check for corrupted code
   segments.

If the application then calls ValidateFreeSpaces() and GlobalCompact(-1)
regularly, it will catch almost all wild global pointers. ValidateFreeSpaces()
checks for any overwritten free blocks, and GlobalCompact(-1) moves and discards
memory, thereby forcing heap and checksum checking.

Please note the following:

 - CCh is used for the free-space fill byte because it will cause the debugger
   to breakpoint if a jump into free space is executed.

 - If EnableSegmentChecksum=1 is used, setting breakpoints may cause spurious
   0x0409 RIPs.

 - Setting all of these checks will noticeably slow the system.

 - If bad free spaces exist, check for fatal exit FFs and LLLLLLLs before the
   address actually appears. A few fatal exits may have to be ignored before the
   address appears.
