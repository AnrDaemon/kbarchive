SUMMARY
=======

On Pages 22 and 23 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler 5.1 Updates and Microsoft
Editor" manual there is an example using various text macros called SaveRegs and
RestRegs. In this example, there are comment strings that overlap onto the next
line because of wrap around.

Please note that this is wrap around from the comment, and not a new instruction.
