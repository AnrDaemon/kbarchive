SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses jumper settings for the AT&T StarLAN network adapter
and the following problems that may occur:

 - The interrupt line address may conflict with devices such as the Microsoft
   Bus Mouse, hard disk drive controllers, and serial and parallel ports.

 - The base I/O address may conflict with expanded-memory boards.

 - The memory map address may conflict with the memory addresses used by
   expanded-memory board drivers, 3270 cards, ESDI hard disk drive controllers,
   and display adapters.

You may need to change jumper settings on the StarLAN adapter and/or other cards
in the system to avoid such conflicts.
