TITLE   :XADM: How to Disable a Mailbox in Exchange Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a user leaves a company, instead of removing that user's mailbox, you may
want to keep it, but not allow other users to send mail to or receive mail from
it.

In Exchange Server version 5.5, you can use the Exchange Server Administrator
program to view the properties of the mailbox, and on the Limits tab, change the
settings so that the mailbox cannot send or receive mail.

In Exchange Server version 5.0, the Exchange Server Administrator program only
allows you to change the settings so that the mailbox cannot send mail; you
cannot prohibit the mailbox from receiving, so other users can still send mail
to it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To disable a mailbox in either Exchange Server 5.0 or 5.5:

1. Use the Exchange Server Administrator program to open the mailbox properties.

2. Click the Advanced tab, click Hide From Address Book, and then click Apply.

3. Click the Limits tab, and in either the Prohibit Send box (in Exchange Server
   5.0) or the Prohibit Send and Receive box (in Exchange Server 5.5), enter
   either 0 or 1 kilobyte (KB).

   NOTE: You can add a user to the Delivery Restrictions tab to reject messages
   from certain users or accept messages from only certain users.

4. Click Apply.

5. Click the E-Mail Addresses tab, and then change the e-mail address for each
   proxy type (for example, SMTP, X.400, Lotus cc:Mail, and Microsoft Mail) for
   the user. Add additional characters to the user names, such as "XXX." For
   example:

   XXXsomeone@microsoft.com

   NOTE: You can also perform a directory export to a .csv file, modify the
   e-mail addresses in Microsoft Excel, and then perform a directory import to
   overwrite the information.
