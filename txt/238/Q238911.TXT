TITLE   :XADM: Delegate Stops Receiving Meeting Requests
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix kbgraphxlinkcritical

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The sender of a meeting request may receive a not read notification (NRN) for a
meeting request sent to a manager who has a delegate defined. The NRN appears to
originate from the manager.

For builds of the Exchange Server information store between 5.5.2580.0 and
5.5.2650.0, the delegate rule may stop working completely. A manager may start
receiving meeting requests, even though the manager has configured the client
with the "Send meeting requests and responses only to my delegates, not to me"
option. The delegate may also stop receiving meeting requests on behalf of the
manager.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the information store incorrectly processes the
delegate rule when a meeting request with an associated read-notification
request is sent to the manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

Sender Receives an NRN
----------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
