TITLE   :COBOL Wizard Specifies Variable as the Return Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP2,4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp2 kbsna400sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 4.0 SP2 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS (COMTI) Component Builder is
used to create a new component library by importing a COBOL program using the
Import COBOL Wizard. After completion, the variable selected to be the return
value appears, as an [output] parameter.

CAUSE
=====

The means of producing this error is fairly complex. At the point where the
wizard asks you to click Finish the operation, instead follow these steps:

1. Click Back

2. Click Back again.

3. Click Next.

4. Click Finish.

WORKAROUND
==========

One workaround is to redo the Import COBOL Wizard operation, avoiding the
sequence specified under the CAUSE section.

A second workaround is to manually correct the component's declarations using
Component Builder.

1. Right-click the method in the left pane and click Unlock.

2. In the right pane, select and delete the inconsistent parameter.

3. Right-click the method in the left pane and click Properties

4. Specify the correct return value using the Properties dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0
Service Pack 2 and Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.
