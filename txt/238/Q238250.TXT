======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) clients that have the Novell intraNetWare client
installed may make excessive calls to NetWare server(s) defined in the client's
PATH statement. This may cause the NetWare server(s) to become unresponsive
because of excessive traffic from the SMS clients. The clients use the
SMSCliSvcAcct& account when connecting to these servers.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use any of the following methods:

 - Remove mapped NetWare drives from the Windows NT PATH statement.

 - Enable the Guest account on the NetWare servers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMSCliSvcAcct& account is a local administrative account on Windows
NT-based SMS clients that is used by the Client service.

This issue has been confirmed only to affect Windows NT 4.0 and Systems
Management Server 2.0 with Service Pack 1 installed.
