How to Use SMS 2.0 to Install Windows NT SP6a
---------------------------------------------

The procedure that is described in this section assumes that you have already
downloaded the Windows NT SP6a files (Sp6i386.exe) from the following Microsoft
Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/SP6/allSP6.asp.

NOTE: You can also obtain Windows NT 4.0 SP6a from the Windows NT 4.0 SP6a
CD-ROM. The Windows NT 4.0 SP6a CD-ROM contains the N4sp6a.pdf file, which you
can use to automatically populate the SMS package and program properties.

1. Extract the Sp6i386.exe files to a Temporary folder.

2. Create a new folder named "NT4sp6a", and then move the Sp6i386.exe files to
   the new folder.

   NOTE: The NT4sp6a folder is the source of the Windows NT4 SP6a SMS package.

3. Start the SMS Administrator console, and then create a new package with
   "NT4sp6a" as the source folder.

   For more information about SMS software distribution and package creation
   options, refer to SMS Online Help.

   NOTE: This example describes how to create the SMS package and the SMS program
   and advertisement separately. You can also use the Distribute Software Wizard
   or the Windows NT 4.0 SP6a Package Definition File (Nt4sp6.pdf) if these
   tools are available.

4. Use the following command line to create a new program for the package you
   created in step 3:

   update\update.exe /q

   You can also manually edit the command line to use any of the Update.exe
   command-line switches that are described in the "Update.exe Command-Line
   Switches" section of this article.

   NOTE: It is important to verify that this command line conforms to the
   specific package source folder structure you have created. SMS is not able to
   browse the folder structure and the program will fail if it does not have the
   correct path to Update.exe.

5. Open the program properties, click the Environment tab, and then ensure that
   the program is either set to run with administrative rights or it is using a
   Windows NT client software installation account that has the proper
   administrative rights (if the Windows NT user does not have local
   administrative rights or if no user is logged on when you create the
   program).

   Typically, a Windows NT client software installation account is used only if
   either the installation source files are not on an SMS distribution point or
   if the installation process needs to access files that are not on an SMS
   distribution point.

6. Select the distribution points to which you want to send the NT4sp6a package.

7. Create a new advertisement for the NT4sp6a package or program that you
   created in step 4.

   Make sure that you select the correct package, program, and collection
   settings on the General tab of the advertisement.

8. If you want to run the service pack installation automatically, open the
   advertisement properties, click the Schedule tab, and then create a mandatory
   assignment for the program.

How to Use SMS 1.2 to Install Windows NT SP6a
---------------------------------------------

1. Use the procedure that is described in the preceding section to create the
   package source.

2. Use the following command line to create a new package for Windows SP6a:

   update/update.exe /q

3. Verify that the workstation command-line options are correctly set for the
   type of installation that you are using.

   The type of installation you select depends on the rights of the user that is
   logged on to the target client.

4. If you are targeting either a low-rights user who does not have local
   administrative rights or a server to which no one logs on, click "System
   (Background) Task".

   The Package Command Manager service handles the installation.

   NOTE: For any package that is using the Package Command Manager service to
   finish successfully:

    - You must configure the package to run completely silently and require no
      user interaction.

    - You must set the System (Background) Task option.

    - You must set the job to run as Mandatory.

   You must manually install the Package Command Manager service on SMS clients.
   For more information about how to use Rservice.exe to manually install
   Pcmsvc32.exe, refer to the Install.doc file that is included in SMS Service
   Pack 4 (SP4). If you do not select the System (Background) Task option, the
   installation is handled by the Package Command Manager program, it is run in
   the foreground, and it requires a logged-on user to have local administrative
   rights to finish the service pack installation.

5. Create a new job to distribute the Windows NT SP6a package, and then target
   it at the clients you want to upgrade.

   If you select the System (Background) Task option for your package, make sure
   to set the job to run as Mandatory. The mandatory date is set to one week in
   advance by default.

Both SMS 1.2 and 2.0 SP6a installations require you to restart the client after
the installation is complete.

NOTE: The service pack Setup program requires you to have administrative rights
after you restart the computer. Windows NT SP6a adds several keys to the RunOnce
registry key. If you have administrative rights, you must to log on to the
client for the service pack Setup program to complete. For additional
