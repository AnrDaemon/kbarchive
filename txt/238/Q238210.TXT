TITLE   :HTTP Keep Alive Header Sent Whenever ASP Buffering is Enabled
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Whenever ASP Buffering is enabled, either through the Microsoft Management
Console (MMC) or programmatically in the Active Server Pages (ASP) page
(response.buffer=true), an HTTP Keep-Alive header will be sent along with the
Content-Length.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

The header can be disabled by adding the following code to the top of the ASP
pages:

   <%response.flush%>

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs even if Keep-Alives are disabled in the MMC. The Keep-Alive
will be ignored by HTTP 1.0 (browser) clients. HTTP 1.0 Proxies will require the
Content-Length header to also be present. This is transmitted by default but
could be modified by an Internet server application programming interface
(ISAPI) filter. If a filter is used and the Content-Length is not sent, then you
will have to implement the workaround described above.

Additional query words: Keep-Alive, IIS, Header, ISAPI, Content-Length, keep alive, content length
