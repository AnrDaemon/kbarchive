TITLE   :XFOR: GroupWise Migration Fails with Event ID 4012
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Exchange Server Migration wizard to migrate users
from a Novell GroupWise 5.5 post office, the migration fails and the following
event is logged in the application event log:

   Event ID: 4012
   Source: MSExchangeMig
   Type: Error
   Category: None

   Description: The following GroupWise users have not granted sufficient access
   rights to the migration account.

In addition, you have verified that the GroupWise users to be migrated have
granted all appropriate proxy access rights to the GroupWise migration account
responsible for the actual migration.

CAUSE
=====

The GroupWise migration account may be residing in a different GroupWise post
office than the GroupWise users being migrated.

Because of limitations with inter-post office proxying in GroupWise, this
configuration is not supported.

RESOLUTION
==========

For each GroupWise post office involved with migration, select a GroupWise
account local to that post office.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange Server
Migration wizard.
