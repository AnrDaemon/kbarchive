STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6 and
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Both of these checking routines are disabled when you apply Microsoft Windows NT
4.0 Service Pack 6, so Windows NT 4.0 can easily support future processors.

This behavior is related to the processing of the data returned by the
KiSetProcessorType() function in the Windows NT 4.0 kernel for Intel-based
computers.
