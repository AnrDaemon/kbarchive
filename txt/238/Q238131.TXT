The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

You may need to disable socket pooling under the following conditions:

 - A low number of sites are being hosted.

 - There are special security concerns.

 - Another application or server has need of port 80 on an IP address.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Socket pooling causes Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 to listen to all
IP addresses, which can present a possible security risk for secure domains with
multiple networks. Also, bandwidth throttling and performance adjustments will
apply to all Web sites configured for the same port (for example port 80). If
bandwidth throttling or performance tuning is being done on a per-site basis,
socket pooling will need to be disabled.

To disable socket pooling, perform the following steps:

1. Start the command prompt and make sure you are in the X:\Inetpub\Adminscripts
   folder (where X is the IIS installation drive). To do this, type the
   following lines at the command prompt:

   X:

   CD\Inetpub\Adminscripts

2. After you open the Adminscripts folder, type the following line at the
   command prompt:

   cscript adsutil.vbs set w3svc/disablesocketpooling true

3. The command replies as follows:

   disablesocketpooling : (BOOLEAN) True

4. Stop and start the IISAdmin service.

5. Restart the WWW service.
