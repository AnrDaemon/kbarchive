The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains why the Browse button is disabled in the Microsoft
Management Console (MMC) when you are administering a remote server. This occurs
when you try to create or modify a virtual directory or virtual Web for a remote
server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are administering an IIS computer remotely, you may find it necessary
to modify the home directory of a Web or virtual directory. When you view the
properties for either of these, the Browse button is disabled (grayed) even
though you can specify the location by typing the path in the text box that is
available.

This is by design. The browse function is disabled because the control only
allows local directory browsing.
