TITLE   :SMS: Queries using SMS_R_SYSTEM Return Inaccurate Results
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a query that uses joins and that contains the SMS_R_SYSTEM
class, you may receive duplicate or inaccurate result sets for some records.
This can occur even if you enable the Omit Duplicate Rows (Select Distinct)
option.

NOTE: To determine if your queries use the SMS_R_System class, view the query
properties, and click Show Query Language.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the SMS_R_System class is an array, based on
several SQL tables.

A composite column is created from all the joined tables keys. This column is
used to order the results so that the query code can roll up the array values.
This column distorts the meaning of the unique directive, and may cause
duplicates.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use the SMS_G_System class instead of the
SMS_R_System class. SMS_G_System is displayed as the "Computer System" class and
SMS_R_System is displayed as the "System Resource" class in the SMS Admin
Console Query Builder Query Statement Properties dialog box. Note that when you
select the Object Type System Resource, you do not select the System Resource
class. If you need to query or report on IP information, you can use the Network
Adapter Config class instead of the System Resource class to avoid using
SMS_R_System.

If you receive duplicate rows when you use SMS_R_System in a query, you can use
the SMSExtract tool included in the Back Office Resource Kit 4.5 to export query
results to Microsoft Access or Microsoft Excel for reporting. After you open the
results in another program, you can remove the duplicate rows.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
