SUMMARY
=======

When you call a method that has optional parameters from Visual C++, you cannot
omit the optional parameters. You need to pass a special VARIANT instead.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some methods have "optional" parameters. In Visual Basic, you can omit them when
calling the method. However, when calling with Visual C++, you have to pass a
special VARIANT whose .vt field has the value VT_ERROR, and .scode field has the
value DISP_E_PARAMNOTFOUND. That is:

         // VARIANT used in place of optional-parameters.
         VARIANT varOpt;
         varOpt.vt = VT_ERROR;
         varOpt.scode = DISP_E_PARAMNOTFOUND; 

This is what Visual Basic is doing behind-the-scenes.
