TITLE   :SMS: Distributing SMS Network Monitor
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

To distribute the Network Monitor tool included with Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1), the package must have a folder structure that is
similar to that of the SMS 2.0 SP1 image. If it does not, the following error
message occurs during installation:

   Unable to find file License.txt under <Package_folder>\..\..\Smssetup

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because there is a hard-coded dependency on the folder
structure within the Network Monitor Setup.exe program.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to overcome this issue:

 - Use the entire SMS source image as the source folder so that the original
   folder and file structure is maintained.

 - Structure your package source similarly to that of the SMS source image, but
   reduce the size of the package by only including the minimal folder structure
   and files. The \Nmext and \Smssetup folder structures must be in place, and
   Setup.exe must be run from the Nmext\<Platform> folder. However, the
   Smssetup folder needs to contain only the License.txt file and no other files
   or folders.
