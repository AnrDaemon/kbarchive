The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 2.0

SYMPTOMS
========

On a server with multiple catalogs, any query page that is not querying the
default catalog needs to specify in its code the catalog it is querying against.
This article provides examples of how to specify the catalog within ASP files
that are using the IXSSO object to query Index Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: This example uses the IXSSO object and is based on Query.asp, which is
installed by default with the Index Server.

In the Query.asp page, find the section that looks like the following:

   set Q = Server.CreateObject("ixsso.Query")
           set util = Server.CreateObject("ixsso.Util")
       Q.Query = CompSearch
       Q.SortBy = "rank[d]"
       Q.Columns = "DocTitle, vpath, filename, size, write, characterization, rank"
       Q.MaxRecords = 300

To specify a catalog in the ASP page, add a line so that section appears
follows:

   set Q = Server.CreateObject("ixsso.Query")
           set util = Server.CreateObject("ixsso.Util")
       Q.CATALOG="<catalogname>"
       Q.Query = CompSearch
       Q.SortBy = "rank[d]"
       Q.Columns = "DocTitle, vpath, filename, size, write, characterization, rank"
       Q.MaxRecords = 300

The Q.Catalog line that you add will have a value equal to the name of your
catalog as it appears in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for Index
Server.
