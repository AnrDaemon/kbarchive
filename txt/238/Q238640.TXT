The Microsoft Windows NT FTP Web site hosts a large amount of documents
available for you to download. Recently, the "How to Set Up the Microsoft
Network Client Version 3.0 for MS-DOS" document was added.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This document describes:

 - How to make a network installation startup disk.

 - How to make an installation disk set and run Setup.

 - How to modify the startup disk for NWLink frame types.

 - How to modify the startup disk network adapters that are not in the list.

 - Additional TCP/IP settings for the Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS.

From the Overview section of the document:

   The Microsoft Windows NT Network Client Administrator tool allows you to
   create a network installation startup disk. This startup disk allows a
   computer to start from a floppy disk that contains the basic MS-DOS system
   files with networking. This allows for an "over-the-network" installation of
   operating systems on computers that do not currently have an operating system
   or networking ability.

This document is available as Dosclnt.exe on the following Microsoft FTP Web
