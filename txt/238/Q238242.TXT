TITLE   :BUG: OLE Automation Returns "Element not found" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbAutomation kbSSafe600bug kbDSupport kbBug kbGrpDSSSafe kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to Visual SourceSafe (VSS) using OLE Automation, the following
error message appears:

   Element not found.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following two workarounds will resolve the problem described in the SYMPTOMS
section:

 - Unregister the VSS 5.0 OLE Automation .dll and register the VSS 6.0 OLE
   Automation .dll using the following commands from a DOS prompt:

      regsvr32 /u <path to 5.0 ssapi.dll>
      regsvr32 <path to 6.0 ssapi.dll>

 - Use early binding instead of late binding (See the REFERENCES section for
   more information on early binding).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem can exist in Visual Basic (VB), VBScript, WScript, or VC (if you
use the Class Wizard to wrap the DLL). The problem only happens on computers
that previously had SourceSafe 5.0 installed on them and then upgraded to
SourceSafe 6.0.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new VB project.

2. Add a button to the form and type the following in the Click event of the
   button:

      Dim objVSSDatabase
      Set objVSSDatabase = CreateObject("SourceSafe")
      objVSSDatabase.Open <"path to SourceSafe srcsafe.ini file\srcsafe.ini">,    <"login">, <"password">

3. Run the program and click the button you just added.
