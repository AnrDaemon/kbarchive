TITLE   :XADM: Event 6206 after Lotus Notes Directory Synchronization
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you perform a directory synchronization (dirsync) with Lotus Notes, there
may be 6206 events in the event log similar to the following:

   Source: MSExchangeNOTES
   Event ID: 6206
   Type: Warning

   MS Exchange Reports: Unable to process custom recipient
   f7afa2e9-b053f1db-852567be-4a3f83 because target address NOTES:Ralph
   Jones/LotusOrg@LotusOrg has already been assigned to Address Book entry
   /o=Ibiza/ou=Shuffletown/cn=Notes Recipients/cn=RalphJ.

CAUSE
=====

This event occurs because an Exchange Server custom recipient has been created
for this Lotus Notes user prior to the dirsync process. When the
Notes-to-Exchange Server dirsync is started, Exchange Server cannot create a
custom recipient because a custom recipient already exists in Exchange Server
for that user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem only occurs after you perform a Notes-to-Exchange Server dirsync,
and occurs after both an immediate full reload and an immediate update.
