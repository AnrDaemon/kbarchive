TITLE   :Partition Utilities Do Not Recognize Hard Drive Partitions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT 4.0 Setup program may not recognize some partitions created by
utilities on Compaq and Dell OEM computers. Therefore, the Windows NT 4.0 Setup
program makes the second partition the bootable partition. However, Setupdd.sys
from Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) writes a boot signature to the
partition table that NTLDR from Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) does not
recognize.


RESOLUTION
