KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 2000 version of this article, see Q200804.

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q238139.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you import files with the same name but with different case from a Unix
server into a Windows-based server, hyperlinks to at least one of the files will
break.

CAUSE
=====

Unix operating systems are case sensitive. For example, files called
"mypage.htm" and "Mypage.htm" are recognized as different files on the Unix
operating system. Because Windows-based operating systems are not case
sensitive, these two files are recognized as being the same file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Save the file with lowercase letters from a Web browser. Change the name of the
file, and then import it into FrontPage.
