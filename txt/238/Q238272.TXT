TITLE   :BUG: Show Difference Causes VSS to Hang on Large Text Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500bug kbSSafe600bug kbSSExplorer _IK kbGrpDSSSafe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Performing a Show Differences between the Microsoft Visual SourceSafe copy of a
5MB or larger text file that contains either Carriage Returns or Line Feeds, and
the Working Folder copy of the same file, causes Visual SourceSafe to either
hang or take an excessive amount of time to complete the request.

RESOLUTION
==========

Keep text files to less than 5 MB in size. Performing the "Show Differences"
operation on files that contain Carriage Returns or Line Feeds at the end of
each line, but are only 3 - 4 MB in size, results in no error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a 5 MB or larger text file with carriage returns or line feeds at the
   end of each line.
2. Add the file to Visual SourceSafe (VSS) by dragging it into the VSS Explorer
   over the root project "$/".
3. Right-click on parent project to select it and choose "Set Working
   Folder...", accept the default settings and click OK.
4. Right-click on the file and choose CHECK OUT.
5. At the next dialog box, click OK.

6. Modify a line of text near the top of your document. For example, on the 5th
   line of your sample file, change the a word to xxxxxxxx.
7. Modify a line of text near the bottom of your document. For example, on the
   5th line from the bottom, change a word to xxxxxxxx.
8. Save the file.
9. In the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, right-click on your sample text document
   and choose Show Differences.

Results:

The Show Differences command will either take a very long time to complete, more
than ten minutes, or it appears to hang.

Expected Results:

The Show Differences command should take a reasonable amount of time to complete.
