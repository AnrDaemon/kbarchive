SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows 2000 installation does not install a Messaging Application
Interface (MAPI) 1.0-based subsystem. There is also no direct way to install a
MAPI 1.0 -based subsystem as an optional component using the operating system
installation CD-ROM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Applications written to the MAPI 1.0 specification may work correctly on Windows
2000 only if the MAPI 1.0 subsystem is completely and correctly installed.
Currently, there are two supported methods to correctly install the MAPI 1.0
subsystem produced by Microsoft. You can either:

 - Upgrade from Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 (Workstation or Server) with MAPI 1.0
   already installed.

or

 - Install an application that contains a MAPI 1.0-based subsystem, such as
   Microsoft Exchange Client or Microsoft Outlook.

The following messaging technologies rely on the presence of an e-mail subsystem
based on the MAPI 1.0 specification:

 - Collaboration Data Objects

 - Active Messaging

 - OLE Messaging

 - MAPI

Applications that use these technologies may not work correctly unless one of the
installation options described previously has been correctly performed.
