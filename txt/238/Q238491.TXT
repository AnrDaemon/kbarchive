======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There is a large community using RFC 822-based protocols, Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol (SMTP), for mail services, who may want to communicate with users of
the Interpersonal Messaging System (IPMS) provided by X.400 systems. The
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Internet X.400 Enhanced Relay
(MIXER) defines a method for mapping message formats between RFC 822/MIME and
X.400.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Possible Configurations
-----------------------

 - A "gateway" between X.400 and SMTP networks. It is not a requirement that
   custom recipients be set up to map recipient addresses.

 - Routing X.400 messages over an Internet connection, or SMTP messages over an
   X.400 Connector.

 - Inter-working with other mail systems that use the RFC 822 Domain Defined
   Attribute (DDA) to encapsulate SMTP addresses. The MIXER message transfer
   agent (MTA) understands this DDA type, and also uses it (in place of the SMTP
   DDA type) when sending a message out of the site.

Address Mapping
---------------

The MTA MIXER supports four types of address mapping:

 - GAL: Use of the Exchange Server global address list (the current method). If
   a custom recipient or a mailbox exists that can map the address, then this
   mapping is taken, and MIXER is not invoked.

 - Encapsulation: An SMTP address can be provided by adding the DDA type RFC 822
   to the site's X.400 address. The value of the DDA is the SMTP address. For
   example, c=co; a=admd, p=Org,
   dda:rfc-822=<user>@<internet_address>.com. An X.400 address can
   be encapsulated in an SMTP address, as in the current product.

 - MCGAM Mapping: This is the MIXER Conformant Global Address Mapping. It is
   implemented in Exchange Server as a plain text file called Mcgam.in.txt,
   which is placed in the MTA's run directory (normally Mtadata). In this file,
   the administrator specifies exactly how addresses are to be mapped, by
   specifying domains and subdomains, and indicating how they are mapped to the
   Country, ADMD, PRMD, Organization, and OrgUnit values, and vice versa.

 - Algorithmic Mapping: RFC 2156/MIXER also specifies how SMTP address strings
   can be automatically mapped to X.400 addresses, for example, c=de; a=admd;
   p=microsoft; o=pss; s= <user_alias> is automatically mapped to
   <user_alias>@pss.microsoft.admd.de. If this mapping is not the one you
   want, then the administrator must define one in the MCGAM File.
