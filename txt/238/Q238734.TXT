SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) as a Remote
Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) client, you can selectively enable
or disable Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)
authentication by setting the OfferMSCHAP registry value.

If the host or router that is attempting to dial in does not support Microsoft
CHAP and does not correctly implement RFC 1331, you may observe delays during
authentication that lead to an unsuccessful Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
connection because of Link Control Protocol (LCP) timeouts.

RESOLUTION
==========

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6 and

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Because of a change made to an existing configurable parameter, you can disable
Microsoft CHAP authentication whether or not your RRAS server is operating as a
RADIUS client. To disable Microsoft CHAP:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rasman\PPP\CHAP

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

   DWORD: OfferMSCHAP
   Value: 0x00000000

4. Quit Registry Editor.

After you add this value, Microsoft CHAP is not offered to PPP clients.
