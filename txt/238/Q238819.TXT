MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is the abstract from the white paper:

   Remote management and diagnostics allow a systems administrator to maintain a
   network of computers from a remote location and to isolate and resolve system
   problems as they occur, without having to visit the individual desktop. In
   today's widely-distributed networks, remote management capability is key to
   efficient systems management and is crucial in any effort to reduce the total
   cost of ownership.

   Microsoft understands that end-to-end systems management is a huge topic. This
   white paper does not attempt to cover all aspects of management, but instead
   describes the remote troubleshooting and diagnostics capabilities of
   Microsoft Windows NT Server and Windows NT Workstation. This paper discusses
   tools included in Windows NT 4.0, the Windows NT Resource Kits, and various
   Microsoft add-on packages, including Microsoft Systems Management Server.
   Note that this document does not provide extensive procedures for using these
   tools, but instead describes situations where these tools are used remotely
   to accomplish specific objectives.
