TITLE   :BUG: WTSQuerySessionInformation() Returns Invalid Client Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAPI kbOSWin2000 kbOSWin2000bug kbSDKPlatform kbSDKWin32 kbDSupport kbGrpDSN

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You should use the WTSQuerySessionInformation function with the filtering flag,
WTSClientAddress, to get the client IP address on a Windows Terminal Client. The
buffer that is returned by this function contains a WTS_CLIENT_ADDRESS structure
for the client address family and address. However, on Windows NT Server version
4.0, Terminal Server Edition (TS4), the client address field is invalid.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround on TS4, you can first use the WTSQuerySessionInformation
function with the WTSClientName filtering flag to get the client name. The
client name is either a dotted IP address or a name string. If the client name
is a name string, use the gethostbyname function to resolve the name to an IP
address.

The following code fragment illustrates how to use the gethostbyname function to
resolve a client name string to its IP address:

      ...
      ...
      ...
      lphp = gethostbyname(szClientName);

      if (lphp == NULL)
      {
         printf("gethostbyname failed: %d", WSAGetLastError());
         return -1;
      }

      inAddr.s_addr = ((struct in_addr far *)(lphp->h_addr))->s_addr;
      printf("Client address: %s\n", inet_ntoa(inAddr));
      ...
      ...
      ...

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because of this bug, both the auditing event log and tsadmin do not show the IP
address of the client.
