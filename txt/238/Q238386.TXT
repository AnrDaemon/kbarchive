SUMMARY
=======

If you create an Address Book view, you may generate a large amount network
traffic.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To generate the Address Book view, Exchange Server sorts the attributes of all
of the items on the global address list and then replicates these changes
throughout the organization.

Depending on the amount of items on the global address list, network traffic may
become exponentially busier. Microsoft recommends that you generate the Address
Book view at a time when network bandwidth is available, preferably after
hours.
