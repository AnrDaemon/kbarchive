======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to branch a shared file you get the following error message:

   A more recent version is checked out.

CAUSE
=====

This error is seen when both of the following conditions are true:

 - The file you are trying to branch is pinned at a previous version.
 - The file it is shared with is currently checked out.

SourceSafe doesn't let you branch the file at a previous version while a more
recent version is checked out.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, see the following:

 - Check the shared file back in.
 - Perform the branch from the command line.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

2. Pin "$/Project2/file1" at current version.

3. Check out "$/Project1/file1" and make a change.

4. Check "$/Project1/file1" back in.
