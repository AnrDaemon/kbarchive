SYMPTOMS
========

During Setup for the Microsoft Zero Administration Kit (ZAK) for Windows 95, the
following Insert CD dialog box is displayed:

   Setup needs the file 'Msie*.exe' from CD 'Internet Explorer CD'. This CD is
   not currently in the drive.

If you click Cancel, Setup does not finish.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because ZAK is designed to detect and install Microsoft
Internet Explorer version 3.x.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue:

1. Create a file named Msie3.exe and place it on the hard disk.

   NOTE: You can create this file using Notepad or a similar program. Make sure
   that .txt is not added to the end of the file name.

2. Select this file when you are prompted to do so, and Setup continues
   normally.

3. After ZAK Setup is finished, replace the Msie3.exe file in the
   C:\Zak95\Setup\Ieak folder with the current Internet Explorer Setup files
   (for example, the IE4Setup.exe file downloaded from the Microsoft Web site or
   the Internet Explorer Setup files created using the Microsoft Internet
   Explorer Administration Kit).

4. Modify the [Office] section in the Msbatch.inf file to reflect the correct
   Setup string.

Original string:

   [Office]
   HKLM,Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce,Ieak,,
   "s:\ieak\MSIE3.EXE /q /r:n"

New string:

   [Office]
   HKLM,Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce,Ieak,,
   "s:\ieak\IE4SETUP.EXE /q /r:n"

5. Continue the installation.
