TITLE   :Software Inventory Creation Date Is Incorrect in SMS Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0

KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbInventory kbsms200sp2fix

The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server (SMS) Resource Explorer may display a created date for
an inventoried file that is different from the created date listed in the file's
properties in Windows Explorer. This problem occurs for two reasons:

 - The software inventory agent (sinv) did not use the file Creation Date as a
   key property. Therefore on a single client, files with the same name but with
   different created time stamps, were treated as the same and were not reported
   separately.

 - The stored procedure (sp_SoftwareInventory) that inserts software inventory
   information into the SMS database also did not use Creation Date as a key
   property. As a result, the time stamp that became associated with the file
   was simply the time stamp of the last reported instance across all clients.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
