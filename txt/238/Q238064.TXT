TITLE   :SMS: Sender Routing in Multi-Tiered Hierarchies

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article summarizes how packages that are configured and sent at a central
site are sent down to grandchild sites. The following hierarchy example is used
in this article:

Central Site
|
Primary Child Site
|
Secondary Child Site (grandchild to the central site)

MORE INFORMATION
================

A package that is configured at a central site and that is destined for all
child sites below it, is sent directly to each child site. However, if the
central site does not have an address to the grandchild site, or if the address
is unavailable (due to scheduling configuration), the central site sends the
package through the grandchild's direct parent. This is called routing.

Routing through the direct parent site is recommended in low bandwidth
environments where the child and the grandchild share the same link to the
central site (such as through dial-up or RAS). Routing is also recommended for
ISDN environments that are billed by connection time, as it prevents the same
package information from being sent twice over the same link.

For more information about senders and addresses, please refer to the Configuring
Site Communications section of the Administrator's Guide, Chapter 8. For
information about scheduling, please refer to the following Help file topics:
