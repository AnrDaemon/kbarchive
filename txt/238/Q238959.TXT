TITLE   :SMS: Access Violation in Winmgmt.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a server that is running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 or Service
Pack 5, Site Server 3.0 Service Pack 2, and the Systems Management Server (SMS)
2.0 client software (with the Hardware Inventory agent installed), you may
receive an "Access violation" error message and possibly a Dr. Watson error
message in Winmgmt.exe.

The access violation may occur shortly after the SMS client runs a Hardware
Inventory agent polling cycle.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is caused by a conflict between the Site Server Authentication
service and the Windows Management service.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a and Site Server
3.0 Service Pack 3.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you cannot install the service packs listed above, you can disable the Site
Server Authentication service to temporarily eliminate the problem. To disable
the Site Server Authentication service, use the Services tool in Control Panel
to stop the service and set it to manual startup.

The Site Server Authentication service is the component that uses information in
the Membership directory to authenticate users who attempt to use Site Server
services. Stopping the Site Server Authentication service disables this
functionality. For more information about the Site Server Authentication
service, please see the Site Server documentation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Site Server 3.0 Service Pack 2.
