SUMMARY
=======

The Windows CE device name can be set in the base registry file by editing a
.reg file (that is, Project.reg) to include the following:

      [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Ident]
      "OrigName"="WinCE"
      "Name"="MyCEPC"

Where "MyCEPC" can be a value of your choosing.

Without this change, the default device name is "WinCE" and you must change the
value in the Control Panel Communications applet.

Adding a preset computer name is useful for testing on the sample CEPC platform
which cannot be warm-booted to activate changes to the registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows CE Server Message Block (SMB) redirector requires that a unique
computer name be set before network file system services can be activated. The
network redirector checks for the existence of the "OrigName" value, and also
checks that it is not set to the same value as "Name".

Until a name is set, accessing network resources using the UNC naming convention
(\\ServerName\ShareName) is not possible.
