SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an Internet Information Server (IIS) ASP page to access a database,
the connection may fail with the following error message:

   Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80004005'

   [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default
   driver specified

CAUSE
=====

If you have used the C2 security program from the Windows NT Resource Kit on
your system, the following registry key may only have read permissions assigned
to the Everyone group:

   Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\ODBC

In order for the ODBC drivers to function properly, the Web user accounts must
have full control of this registry key.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To assign full-control permissions to the Everyone group, follow these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\ODBC

3. On the Security menu, select Permissions.

4. Select Replace Permission on Existing Subkeys and set the permissions for the
   Everyone group to full control.

5. Quit Registry Editor.
