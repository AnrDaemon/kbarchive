TITLE   :XIMS: MTA Queues Mail for "Inbound Only" Internet Mail Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the transfer mode on the Connections tab of the Internet Mail Service
Properties page is configured as "Inbound Only," the message transfer agent
(MTA) may still queue outbound mail for that Internet Mail Service even though
the Internet Mail Service does not pick up and deliver the mail.

CAUSE
=====

The Internet Mail Service has an SMTP address space defined on the Address Space
tab of the Internet Mail Service Properties page. This address space causes an
SMTP route for this Internet Mail Service to appear in the routing table. The
MTA sees that as a valid route for outbound SMTP mail. As a result, the MTA
queues mail for that Internet Mail Service.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem can be resolved by removing the Address Space from the Internet
Mail Service entirely. To do so, on the Internet Mail Service Properties page,
click the Address Space tab, and remove any address spaces that are defined
there.

After routing has been recalculated, the SMTP route for that Internet Mail
Service should disappear from the routing table. After this occurs, the MTA will
no longer queue outbound mail for that Internet Mail Service because it will not
see a route for it.
