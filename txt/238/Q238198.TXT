TITLE   :RAS Callback to a Hunt Group Does Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Callback feature on a Windows NT Remote Access Services (RAS)
server to perform a callback to a hunt group number, the callback authentication
does not succeed and the connection may be terminated with the following error
message:

   Event ID: 20077
   Description: The PPP negotiation is not converging.

CAUSE
=====

The RAS server uses only one port for a callback (when the Callback Security
feature is enabled), and that callback must occur on the same client port that
performed the dial-out connection.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A hunt group is a group of phone lines in which you are connected to the first
number available when you dial, or you receive a busy signal. If you receive a
busy signal, you try one of the other hunt groups.
