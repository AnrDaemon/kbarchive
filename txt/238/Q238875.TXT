TITLE   :PRB: C2471 or LNK1140 Error with PDB File Limits
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbDebug kbLinker kbVC kbVC500 kbVC600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following errors are normally related to running into the module and size
limits when a program database (PDB) file is created (a PDB file contains
information used by the debugger; the file has a .pdb extension):

Compiler Error:

   C2471: cannot update program database

Linker Error:

   LNK1140 "too many modules for program database; relink with /PDB:NONE"

CAUSE
=====

There is a limit of 4096 modules (.obj files) in a PDB file. The file also has a
total size limit of approximately 64 MB.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are several ways to reduce the size of PDB files:

 - Build some of the source files with the /Zd switch (line numbers only).

 - Build some of the source files as separate dynamic-link libraries (DLLs)
   instead of static libraries.

 - Build some of the source files without debug information.

 - Try the compiler switch /Fd"myproject.pdb" (including the quotation marks).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that the linker option /PDBTYPE:SEPT may have little affect in reducing the
project's PDB file size. In Visual C++ 5.0, if you choose to use the /Fd switch,
avoid using the linker option /PDBTYPE:SEPT if the PDB file name you choose is
the same under compiler and linker options.
