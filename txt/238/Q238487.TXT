PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Lotus Notes Connector may stop responding (hang) when a
message comes in from Lotus Notes if a colon (:) is at the beginning of the
address list. The connector hangs indefinitely until the message is removed; it
does not shut down or generate an error. The connector continually attempts to
process the message, causing mail to back up in the queue.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
