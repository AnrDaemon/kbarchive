TITLE   :W3C Log File Format May Contain Spaces in CS-Username Field
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbiis400

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Applications which use the IIS log files in W3C format may produce errors or
incorrect reports. This may be observed as parsing, or similar errors being
encountered during processing.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT SAM will permit user accounts that contain spaces in the name
such as "JOE BLOGGS". When IIS creates the log file entry for an access to the
site with this account, it does not delimit the cs-username field with quotes.
As the W3C log is delimited by spaces, this can cause problems for applications,
such as Site Server - Usage Analysis, which process these log files.

WORKAROUND
==========

Make sure that user accounts used for Web authentication do not contain spaces
in the username.

If this is not be possible, then the log fie will need to be pre-processed to
delimit the cs-username field before log file analysis can be performed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server 4.0.
