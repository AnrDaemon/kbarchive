   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to reroute messages through the Microsoft Exchange
Server information store before sending to the Internet. Enabling the rerouting
adds some advantage because the rerouted messages have more readable addresses.
These messages are re-routed through the information store by using the Registry
Editor (Regedt32.exe) to set the following registry value to 1:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters

   Value Name: RerouteViaStore
   Data Type: Reg_Dword
   Data: 1

MORE INFORMATION
================

When this registry value is set to 1, it internally enables two parameters
required for this option to work, if they aren't already enabled, namely the
P2Resolve and AddressRewrite parameters.

If you enable rerouting of the Internet Mail Service object, then outbound
messages are rerouted through the information store instead of being re-sent or
"bounced" as normal. The Rerouting tab is located on the Internet Mail Server
Routing property page, in the Configuration container.

Enabling rerouting adds some advantage because the rerouted message's P1 and P2
From field, and P2 recipients are replaced with any locally matched custom
recipient's reply address. Addresses without matching custom recipients are not
altered. P1 recipients continue to be rewritten in accordance with the routing
table.
