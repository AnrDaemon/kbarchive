PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbConfig kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbSiteComp kbsms200sp1fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SMS_NT_LOGON_DISCOVERY_AGENT service on some logon points may not start
because of a logon problem.

CAUSE
=====

The password for the SMSLogonSVC account may not be synchronized with the rest
of the Systems Management Server (SMS) domain, causing the service not to start
correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install SMS 2.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) or later. After you
have applied SP1 successfully to all the sites that share the same Microsoft
Windows NT-based domain, the NT Logon Discovery Agent services on domain
controllers are reinstalled with the new SMSLogonSVC account password during the
next senior site's Logon Server Manager domain update cycle.
