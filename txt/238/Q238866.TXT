-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On Systems Management Server 2.0 site and logon servers, you may see an error
message in the Microsoft Windows NT event log that is similar to the following
example:

   Event ID: 1011, Source: Perflib, The library file
   "D:\SMSLOGON\I386\SMSPERF.dll" specified for the
   "SMSPerfCountersForD:_SMSLOGON_I386_SMSPERF.DLL" service could not be opened.
   Performance data for this service will not be available. Status code is data
   DWORD 0.

This error message occurs on Compaq servers that have Compaq Insight Agents
installed. The error message usually occurs approximately 13 hours after
restarting, and repeats every two minutes thereafter until the next restart.

You may also see this error message on other types of servers. This error message
is usually related to a problem with the Smsperf.dll file.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of a conflict between Compaq Insight Manager (or
other type of performance data gathering software), and the Smsperf.dll file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the appropriate method.

NOTE: You can only use these methods for Compaq computers.

 - Upgrade the server to Compaq Insight Agents 4.23b or later, and install
   Microsoft Windows NT Service Pack 5 or later.

 - Uninstall Compaq Insight Agents and install a version of Compaq Insight
   Agents earlier than version 4.22.

 - Stop the Insight Host Agent and Insight Web Agent on the server every 12
   hours.
