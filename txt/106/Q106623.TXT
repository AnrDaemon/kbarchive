TITLE   :FFAPI: ERR MSG: Unknown Service or Bad Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:2.1,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit: FFAPI for Gateways and Applications, versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Mail File Format API (FFAPI) "put" programs may return the following
errors:

   151-1-2 - Unknown service xxx
   142-1-2 - Bad Address

CAUSE
=====

File Format API (FFAPI) uses address type CSI (for Consumer Software Inc.) to
denote a Microsoft Mail style address. For example, if a foreign directory
synchronization message is being submitted to MS Mail Directory Synchronization
from FFAPI, the "TO:" line could be one of the following:

   TO:CSI:net/po/$system
   TO:net/po/$system

Inside the message body, however, address updates and the reqname field use
address type PCM (for PC Mail) because this part of the message is processed by
directory synchronization. For example:

   [dirsync]
   task=export
   reqname=PCM:net/po
   transactions=inbody

   [dirsync-transactions]
   1200 A Martin, Robert PCM:net/po/rmartin

RESOLUTION
==========

Specify address type CSI or no address type at all whenever FFAPI has to
interpret the address. Otherwise, use address type PCM.
