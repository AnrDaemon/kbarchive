TITLE   :BUG: Sample Code for GRDEMO Contains Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling GRDEMO.FOR with extended error handling ($DEBUG or /4Yb) generates the
following error:

   GRDEMO.FOR(449) : error F2536: S : subscript 7 out of range

The default directory for the GRDEMO program is:

   \F32\SAMPLES\GRAPHICS\DEMO

CAUSE
=====

Subroutine "MonitorWarning" declares a local array S as:

      CHARACTER*60 S(6)

However, the corresponding DATA statement initializes seven elements.

There is also an error in the main program where variable iModesCur is set to 0
(zero) and then used to access an array.

RESOLUTION
==========

   On line 247, change

      iModesCur = 0

to the following:

      iModesCur = 1

On line 439, change

      CHARACTER*60 s(6)

to the following:

      CHARACTER*60 s(7)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0
and 1.0a for MS-DOS.

This example does not exist in FORTRAN PowerStation 32.
