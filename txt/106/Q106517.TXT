-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the NEC Ultralight Versalinear display driver is installed when you run the
upgrade setup program for Windows or Windows for Workgroups, Setup may stop
responding (hang) when you switch from MS-DOS mode to the graphical Windows mode
portion.


CAUSE
=====

The NEC Ultralight Versalinear display driver is designed to run only in 386
enhanced mode Windows. Since the graphical portion of Setup runs in standard
mode, Setup hangs when this display driver is installed. The behavior of the
Versalinear driver is similar to that of the ATI Mach 32 driver. The Versalinear
may or may not display a warning message indicating that the driver requires 386
enhanced mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

To successfully run Setup, do the following:

1. Run Setup from Disk 1.

2. From the Setup screen, choose Custom Setup.

3. On the System Information screen, change the display type from Ultralight
   Versalinear to VGA.

4. Continue through Setup. Once Setup is finished, run Setup within Windows and
   change the display back to Ultralight Versalinear.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Ultralight Versalinear is manufactured by NEC, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
