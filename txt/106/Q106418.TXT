======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you force Workgroups Schedule+ to automatically load by placing it in the
StartUp group or on the LOAD= line of your WIN.INI file, the cursor may remain
as an hourglass until you move the mouse.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

This situation does not occur if you start Schedule+ by placing it on the RUN=
line of your WIN.INI file. At this time, the only workarounds available are to
use the RUN= line, move the mouse to restore the pointer, or not automatically
load Workgroups Schedule+.
