SUMMARY
=======

When WINVER.EXE is executed from within Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11,
it reports "386 Enhanced Mode Windows Version 3.10," but when executed from an
MS-DOS Prompt or outside of Windows, it reports "Windows for Workgroups Version
3.11."

MORE INFORMATION
================

When executed from within Windows, WINVER.EXE does a "GetVersion" API call,
which returns version 3.10 from the kernel. The version that the kernel reports
was not changed for this version of Windows for Workgroups.
