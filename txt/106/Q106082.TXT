TITLE   :WFWG Setup May Not Detect Existing 32-Bit Disk Access Drivers

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade a Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.1 installation to
Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Setup may not detect existing 32-Bit Disk Access
drivers. As a result, Setup may add a second set of entries for the default
32-Bit Disk Access drivers, resulting in an error message at startup.

CAUSE
=====

Windows for Workgroups Setup does not check for a path statement when looking
for 32-Bit Disk Access drivers. For example, it would find

        DEVICE=CPQWDCTRL.386

but would not find

        DEVICE=C:\CPQ\CPQWDCTL.386

or

        DEVICE=C:\CPQINT13.386

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, edit the SYSTEM.INI file and remove the following
lines from the [386Enh] section:

      device=*wdctrl
      device=*int13

Additional query words: 3.11 fastdisk cpqint13.386 cpq int13 int 13 386 cpqwdctrl.386 access drivers
