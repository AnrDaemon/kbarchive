The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Windows NT Resource Guide (volume 1 of the Microsoft Windows NT
Resource Kit) on page 612 states:

London appears in the From box at the initial logon screen of Windows
NT computers in the Topeka domain. Thus a user from the Topeka domain
can log on at a computer in the London domain.

This information is incorrect.

The previous page (page 611) of the guide states that London trusts
Topeka. In this instance, Topeka appears in the From box at the
initial logon screen of Windows NT computers in the London domain.
Users logging on in the Topeka domain will only see Topeka and their
local workstation.

Additional query words: prodnt reskit trust
