======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft FORTRAN Compiler for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1, 5.0, 5.1 
 - Microsoft FORTRAN compiler for OS/2, versions 4.1, 5.0, 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a subroutine or an external function with entry points has an argument
passed by value, the compiler generates the following warning message for every
ENTRY statement in the code:

   warning F4201: ENTRY : formal argument : attribute VALUE : mismatch

RESOLUTION
==========

This warning message can be ignored, provided that there is no other problem
with the ENTRY statements.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was fixed in FORTRAN PowerStation
32, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code produces the F4201 warning message on compilation, but
will properly execute to yield correct results:

   63

Sample Code
-----------

   C No compiler options required

         subroutine x(i)
         integer i[value]
         print *, i*3

         entry y(i)
         print *, i*7
         end

         program test
         integer j
         j = 5
         call x(j)
         j = 9
         call y(j)

         end
