TITLE   :MS-DOS 6.2x ScanDisk Fails to Correct MDBPB Problem
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

ScanDisk may repeatedly detect corruption in the Microsoft DoubleSpace BIOS
parameter block (MDBPB) and report it has corrected the problem even though it
has not.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a ScanDisk rounding problem that occurs during the
calculation of the minimum estimated compression ratio (ECR).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reset the DoubleSpace compression ratio and then
run ScanDisk. For example:

1. Set the DoubleSpace compression ratio to any fixed value (that is, don't
   allow DoubleSpace to set it to the default). For example, type "dblspace
   /ratio=2" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
   press ENTER. If your compression ratio is already 2:1, set it to 3:1.

2. Run ScanDisk to correct the MDBPB problem.

3. Run DoubleSpace to reset the compression ratio. For example, type "dblspace
   /ratio" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
   press ENTER.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS ScanDisk version 6.2. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
