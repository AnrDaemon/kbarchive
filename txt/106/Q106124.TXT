TITLE   :Microsoft 6.x Backup Doesn't Back Up Empty Subdirectories
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Backup for Windows and Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS do not back up or
restore empty subdirectories during partial backups whether you select an empty
subdirectory or a group of directories that includes both an empty subdirectory
and populated subdirectories.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - You can back up and restore an empty subdirectory if you back up the entire
   source drive's contents by selecting All Files in the Backup From box.

-or-

 - You can back up a partial group of subdirectories and files by selecting the
   Restore Empty Directories and Prompt Before Creating Directories options
   after choosing the Options button on the Restore screen. However, be aware
   that you will be prompted for each unwanted subdirectory from the entire
   source disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally, when you select a directory in Backup for MS-DOS, the selected
directory appears with an arrow beside it, indicating that the directory
contains files and will be backed up. However, an empty subdirectory selected in
Backup for MS-DOS appears without an arrow.

If you select an empty subdirectory in Backup for Windows, a black square appears
beside it, which is the same symbol that appears when you select a populated
directory.

A partial backup of drives cannot restore empty subdirectories; empty
subdirectories can only be restored with full backups.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS versions 6.0 and 6.2. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
