KEYWORDS:msdos

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your Turtle Beach sound card may not function correctly after you run MemMaker.

CAUSE
=====

MemMaker does not detect the memory range used by the Turtle Beach sound card
ROM.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Edit your CONFIG.SYS file and add X= parameters to exclude the memory ranges
   used by your sound card. For example:

   device=c:\dos\emm386.exe noems highscan x=d000-d1ff x=d600-d7ff

   NOTE: To determine what the memory address your card uses, consult your
   hardware documentation or contact Turtle Beach.

2. Run MemMaker, choosing Custom Setup.

3. Choose Yes in response to the prompt "Keep current EMM386 memory exclusions
   and inclusions?"
