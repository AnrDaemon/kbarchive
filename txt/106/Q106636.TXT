TITLE   :FIX: Debugger Does Not Properly Trace Include Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The debugger does not highlight the current point of execution of an include
file containing executable statements.

CAUSE
=====

The debugger does not recognize that the include file is in a different source
window. All lines in the include file are interpreted by the debugger as being
in the same window as the main source.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0
for MS-DOS. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN PowerStation maintenance
release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "Link32 | more " from
\F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0,
and it will show version 1.0f for the maintenance release version 1.0a.

To demonstrate the problem:

1. Build the sample code with the project in debug mode.

2. Open a source window for both sample code files (note that the include file
   will not show up in the list of files associated with the project because the
   include statement has a label).

3. Single step; the current point will be line 1 of TEST.FOR.

4. Single step; the highlight showing the current point will be at line 2 of
   TEST.FOR, but the actual current point is line 12 of TEST.INC. The following
   will be printed to the F32 Debug window:

   Main Line 1

5. Single step; the highlight showing the current point will be at line 3 of
   TEST.FOR, but the actual current point is line 13 of TEST.INC. The following
   will be printed:

   Inc Line 2

6. Single step; line 4 of TEST.FOR is shown, but it actually is line 14 of
   TEST.INC. The following will be printed:

   Inc Line 3

7. Single step; line 5 of TEST.FOR is shown, and it actually is line 5 of
   TEST.FOR! Both lines 4 of both TEST.INC and TEST.FOR were executed. The
   following will be printed:

   Inc Line 4
   Main Line 4

Sample Code (TEST.FOR)
----------------------

     1   print *, 'Main Line 1'
   c 2
     3   include 'test.inc'
     4   print *, 'Main Line 4'
     5   end

Sample Code (TEST.INC)
----------------------

   c 11
     12  print *, 'Inc Line 2'
     13  print *, 'Inc Line 3'
     14  print *, 'Inc Line 4'
