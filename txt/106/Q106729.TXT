TITLE   :FIX: EOF and BACKSPACE Cause GP Fault When the Unit Isn't Open
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Passing an unopened unit number to the EOF intrinsic function or the BACKSPACE
command generates the run-time error:

FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS
-------------------------------

   DOSXMSF : fatal error DX1020: unhandled exception: General protection fault;

FORTRAN PowerStation 32 for Windows NT
--------------------------------------

   Application Error

   The instruction at "0x0001316e" referenced memory at 0x00000000". The memory
   could not be "read".

CAUSE
=====

The following run-time error should be produced:

   run-time error F6420: EOF()
   - unknown unit number

RESOLUTION
==========

Only use the EOF function and BACKSPACE command on units that are currently
open.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was fixed in FORTRAN PowerStation,
version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code generates a DX1020 error (GPF) when run:

Sample Code

   C Compile options: None
         logical l
         open(2,file='test.out')
