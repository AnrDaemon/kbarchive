======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to send a WinPopup message to a user or computer that does not exist
on the network or to yourself, you receive the following error message:

   An error occurred while sending the message. The message alias cannot be
   found on the local-area network.

However, if you send a WinPopup message to a workgroup that is not on the
network, you do not receive an error message; instead, you are informed that the
"message was successfully sent" even though this is not the case.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open WinPopup.

2. From the Messages menu, choose Send.

3. In the To box, select Workgroup.

4. In the text box, insert an invalid workgroup name (for example, "INVALID").

   NOTE: The Browse button is not accessible for workgroup names; it is available
   only for user and computer names.

5. Choose OK.

The following message appears even though the workgroup INVALID does not exist:

   The message was successfully sent.
