BUG# ODBCDBASE: 1858 (1.01.1928)

SYMPTOMS
========

The ODBC Access driver returns incorrect pcbValue when a column with the ODBC
SQL type SQL_TIMESTAMP is converted to SQL_C_DATE via SQLBindCol or SQLGetData.

The following assumes that there is a table called DATETEST in which column
number 2 is a column of type datetime:

 - SQLExecDirect the statement:

   select * from DATETEST

 - Do a SQLBindCol on col #2 so that fCType is SQL_C_DATE.

 - Do a SQLFetch.

 - Examine the value of *pcbValue.

It will be 10; while the expected =6.

The same (invalid) pcbValue is returned if, instead of SQLBindCol, data is
retrieved through SQLGetData with fCType = SQL_C_DATE.

Correct pcbValue is returned when fCType = SQL_C_TIME.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Access Driver version
1.01.1928. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 1.01.1928
