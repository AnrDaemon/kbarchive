1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   copy <path>:\wizard.dll <destination>

   where <path> is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
   extracting WIZARD.EXE file and <destination> is the drive and directory
   where you want the WIZARD.DLL file to reside. For example, if you ran the
   self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and you want your
   WIZARD.DLL file to be located in the WINDOWS directory on drive C, type the
   following command:

   copy a:\wizard.dll c:\windows

   directory, then restart Schedule+.
