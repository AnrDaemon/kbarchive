-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to resize a DoubleSpace-compressed drive, you may receive one of
the following messages (when drive C is compressed):

   DoubleSpace cannot change the size of drive C.
   There is not enough free space on drive C to complete this operation. Delete
   some unnecessary files from drive C and try again.

   -or-

   DoubleSpace cannot change the size of drive <H>.
   There is not enough free space on your original startup drive, which is now
   drive <H>. DoubleSpace will need at least <0.XX> MB of free space
   on that drive. Delete some files from that drive, and try this operation
   again.

where <H> is your host drive and <0.XX> is the free minimum space
needed on your host drive.

CAUSE
=====

The first error message is incorrect and can occur if you specify too little
free space to be left available on the host drive. For example, if your drive C
is compressed and you type "dblspace /size /reserve=0.00 c:" (without the
quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER, you receive
this error.

Although the second error message is accurate, you may not be able to delete
enough files from the host drive to allow the resize process to succeed.

RESOLUTION
==========

The minimum free space you can leave on the host drive (for a boot drive) varies
depending on the size of your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files; however, a
general rule is approximately 0.4 megabytes. If drive C is compressed and you
want to leave the minimum space free on the host drive, type "dblspace /size
/reserve=0.4 c:" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and
then press ENTER.

If you receive the second error message noted above, DoubleSpace cannot resize
your drive due to the large size of your AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, or
DBLSPACE.INF file. Use the following procedure to resize your
DoubleSpace-compressed drive:

1. Rename CONFIG.SYS to CONFIG.PSS. For example, type "ren c:\config.sys
   config.pss" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and
   then press ENTER.

   WARNING: If your CONFIG.SYS file contains references to device drivers that
   are needed to access your hard disk drive, do not rename your CONFIG.SYS
   file.

2. Rename AUTOEXEC.BAT to AUTOEXEC.PSS.

3. Reboot your computer and then resize your DoubleSpace-compressed drive.

4. If you still cannot resize your DoubleSpace-compressed drive:

    - Copy your DBLSPACE.INF file to DBLSPACE.PSS.

    - Edit your DBLSPACE.INF file and remove any comments or other lines you
      don't need.

    - Reboot your computer and then resize your DoubleSpace-compressed drive.

    - Copy DBLSPACE.PSS over the DBLSPACE.INF you modified. For example, type
      "copy c:\dos\dblspace.pss c:\dos\dblspace.inf" (without the quotation
      marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

5. Rename CONFIG.PSS to CONFIG.SYS.

6. Rename AUTOEXEC.PSS to AUTOEXEC.BAT

7. Reboot your computer so that the original AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files
   are processed.

To avoid this problem in the future, leave more free space on your host drive.
For example, to reserve one megabyte of free space, type "dblspace /size
/reserve=1 c:" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and
then press ENTER.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DoubleSpace copies the following files to the host drive so that it can continue
resizing the drive if the power fails during the resize process:

   AUTOEXEC.000              ; copy of C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT
   CONFIG.000                ; copy of C:\CONFIG.SYS
   DBLSPACE.EXE              ; copied from C:\DOS
   DBLSPACE.HLP              ; copied from C:\DOS
   DBLSPACE.INF              ; copied from C:\DOS
   DBLSPACE.WIN              ; file to keep track of Windows
   DEFRAG.EXE                ; copied from C:\DOS

If your AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, and/or DBLSPACE.INF files have grown
significantly since you resized your DoubleSpace-compressed drive to its minimum
size, you may not be able to resize the drive. If your DBLSPACE.INF file has not
changed, you need 339,646 bytes free on your host drive, plus the size of your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

NOTE: Using the DoubleSpace command-line switches, you can set the minimum free
space to be left on the host drive to .13 megabytes less than you can using the
user interface of the DoubleSpace maintenance program.
