 - Microsoft Wine Guide for Windows, versions 1.0, 2.0

SYMPTOMS
========

The animations in Art Gallery or Wine Guide may be distorted, or may fail to
play at all. This can occur if you are using an ATI video card and an ATI Mach
video driver (either Mach 8 or Mach 32).

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, follow these steps:

1. Open the ATI Flexdesk control panel. This utility ships with the ATI Mach
   video cards.

2. Click Advanced.

3. Set the Device Bitmaps setting for the video card to Off.

Changing this setting enables the animations in Art Gallery and Wine Guide to run
correctly.
