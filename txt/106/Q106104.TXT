======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Normally you should be able to drag and drop any program (executable file) from
File Manager to an active program group in Program Manager in order to create a
new icon in that group. If the directory in which the file resides has a 245
character-long name, the following error message appears:

   Invalid Path: The Path is Invalid

The icon is created, but the path is truncated. If you try to start the program
by double-clicking the icon, the following error message appears:

   Application Execution Error: Cannot find file <drive><long-
   directory><file name> (or one of its components): check to ensure
   that the path and file name are correct and that all required libraries are
   available.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here as it becomes available.
