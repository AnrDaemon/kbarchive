TITLE   :Windows for Workgroups Hangs at Startup with HP VxD HPVNPD.386

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows for Workgroups fails to load if you are using the Hewlett-Packard (HP)
virtual device driver (VxD) HPVNPD.386 with 32-bit file access (VFAT) enabled.

CAUSE
=====

HPVNPD.386 allows you to print from Windows for Workgroups directly to a printer
connected to the network by an HP JetDirect card. This VxD accepts data from
Print Manager and redirects it over the network using the DLC protocol.

Unfortunately, when both HPVNPD.386 and VFAT are enabled, Windows for Workgroups
stops responding (hangs) when you attempt to start it.

HPVNPD is calling Exec_VxD_Int. This service does not consistently work properly
under Windows for Workgroups. It works some of the time, but many times calling
Exec_VxD_Int causes the WIN386 event manager to become confused. Having VFAT
installed causes the WIN386 event manager to become confused every time
Exec_VxD_Int is called.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, disable VFAT or obtain an updated HPVNPD.386 driver
from HP.
