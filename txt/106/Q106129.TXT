TITLE   :Err Msg Running MemMaker: EMM386 DMA Buffer Is Too Small...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you run MemMaker:

   EMM386 DMA Buffer is too small. Add D=48 parameter and reboot.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you are running:

 - Qemm instead of EMM386.EXE version 4.48 (which is included with MS-DOS 6.2).

 - EMM386.EXE version 4.44 (which is included with Windows 3.1).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Change the EMM386.EXE command in your CONFIG.SYS file to correctly reference
   the version supplied with MS-DOS 6.2, and then run MemMaker. For an example
   of this command, see step 2 in the procedure below.

-or-

 - Replace the Qemm commands with the correct MS-DOS commands for HIMEM.SYS and
   EMM386.EXE and then run MemMaker. To do so:

   1. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and remove the Qemm statements to disable Qemm.

   2. Add DEVICE commands for HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE (including the D=48
      parameter). For example:

   device=c:\dos\himem.sys
   device=c:\dos\emm386.exe d=48

   3. Reboot your computer and run MemMaker.
