SUMMARY
=======

As a network administrator, when you install Creative Writer or Fine Artist to a
Novell network file server, you should give users the following rights:

 - Read on the root

 - Filescan on the root

Alternatively, you may use the map root command on the directory where you
install the program.

By default, Creative Writer or Fine Artist searches the root for the MSKIDS
directory or folder.

If you do not map root or provide your users the correct rights, they will
receive "can't find file" error messages when they try to run the application or
open files.
