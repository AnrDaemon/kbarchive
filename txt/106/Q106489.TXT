SUMMARY
=======

FoxPro for Windows requires a mouse. MS-DOS users who are used to using the
keyboard for creating screens are often confused by the lack of keyboard support
in the Screen Builder. In a graphical environment such as Windows, the mouse
provides a more effective means of locating and/or moving objects than the
keyboard does.

To complete the transition from designing with the keyboard to designing with the
mouse, icons have been added for every tool in the Screen Builder. These icons
take the place of the menu shortcuts that exist in FoxPro for MS-DOS.

Additional query words: VFoxWin FoxWin 2.50
