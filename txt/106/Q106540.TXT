TITLE   :Scenes 1.0: Cannot Install the After Dark Module
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you choose Custom Installation for Microsoft Scenes, you cannot install the
After Dark module. The After Dark option in the Custom Installation dialog box
is unavailable (dimmed).

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Scenes setup program searches the AD_PREFS.INI file in the Windows
directory for a PATH= line to determine where After Dark is installed. If the
AD_PREFS.INI is not present or there is no PATH= line in the AD_PREFS.INI file,
the After Dark module is not installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

AD_PREFS.INI is an initialization file that is created and used by After Dark.
If this file does not exist in the Windows directory, you can create one using a
text editor, such as the MS-DOS Editor or Windows Notepad. This file should
contain the following:

   [After Dark]
   path=c:\<directory>\ 

Where <directory> is the path to your After Dark directory. Save this file
to your Windows directory as AD_PREFS.INI.

If the file already exists in the Windows directory, add the PATH= line as shown
above.
