TITLE   :BUG: GPF on Expanding Adjustable Size Array After Execution
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After the program finishes execution under the debugger, expanding an adjustable
size array in the Watch window may cause a general protection (GP) fault.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0
for MS-DOS.

This is not a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation 32.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To duplicate the problem:

1. Build the following sample code in debug mode from the Visual Workbench:

         real*4 arr(20)
         arr = 7.
         Call Sub (arr, 20)
         End

         Subroutine Sub (arr,n)
         real*4      arr(n)
         arr(1) = n+1.2
         print*, arr(1)
         Return
         End

2. Set a breakpoint at:

         print*, arr(1)

3. "Go" (press F5).

4. Type "ARR" (without the quotation marks) in the Watch window, and expand it.

5. Shrink it back to "+ARR = {...}" (without the quotation marks) and press F5
   again.

6. After the program finishes execution, again expanding the variable ARR may
   cause a GP fault.
