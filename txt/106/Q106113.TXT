TITLE   :Doc Err: Mandatory Profiles Assigned to Local Groups
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

The information in this article applies to:

Step 4 on page 428 of the Windows NT Advanced Server System Guide
implies that mandatory user profiles can be assigned to local groups.
This is a documentation error. If you assign a mandatory profile to a
local group when you, as a user from that local group, attempt to log
onto a Windows NT computer other than the primary domain server in
that domain, you the following error message appears:

   The mandatory profile cannot be loaded.

You are then unable to logon.

This occurs because local groups can be accessed only by the domain
servers and not by the workstations. Also, the permissions on the
profiles assigned to local groups can be read only by the primary
domain controller of the domain.

You should assign mandatory user profiles to Global groups instead of
Local groups.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows NT
Advanced Server System Guide for Version 3.1. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
