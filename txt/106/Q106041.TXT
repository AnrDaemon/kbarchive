TITLE   :WFWG Chat Err Msg: No Connection to <Computername>
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The error message

   No connection to <Computername>

(where <Computername> is the machine you are attempting to use Chat with)
appears when you are using Chat in multiuser mode and attempting to communicate
with a user who has a Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or Microsoft Windows NT
machine.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs if you try to add a user to a Chat session when that
user is using an older version of Chat. Neither Windows for Workgroups nor
Windows NT support the multiuser feature of Chat.

NOTE: This error also occurs if a user elects to close Chat before answering
(that is, the user clicks on the "ringing" minimized phone and then clicks
Close.)

STATUS
======

There is no workaround for this problem.
