SUMMARY
=======

When you use using version 3.0 of Messaging Application Program Interface
(MAPI), the Compose operation is a combination of creating a message and opening
it. You can only subclass a message's Compose function when you subclass the
message's Open function. Therefore, in order for a dynamic- link library (DLL)
to be called when you select the Compose button, both the Compose and Read
operation flags must be 1. In addition, the Compose button is only tied to the
IPM.Microsoft Mail.Note type.

Example
-------

Below is an example of the MSMAIL.INI [Custom Messages] section. This example
starts the Notepad program when you select the Compose button. NOTE: The Read
operation is set to 1 in the working example.

The following example works:

   IPM.Microsoft
   Mail.Note=3.0;;;;appexec.dll;notepad.exe;1100000000000000;;;;;

The following example does not work:

   IPM.Microsoft
   Mail.Note=3.0;;;;appexec.dll;notepad.exe;1000000000000000;;;;;

Additional query words: 3.00
