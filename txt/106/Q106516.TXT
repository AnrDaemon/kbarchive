======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are typing in Creative Writer, the watch cursor may appear every time
you type a letter. This occurs if the text on the line you are typing is
formatted for a different size than the text on the previous line. This problem
only occurs when the line height of the two lines is different.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer versions 1.0, 1.1
and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, you may want to type all your text first, then change the
fonts or point sizes.
