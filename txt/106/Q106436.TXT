PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SmartVu display on Dell computers is bypassed if the virtual file allocation
table (VFAT) is enabled using Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because the system BIOS is bypassed when reading and writing to the
hard disk drive if VFAT is enabled. The most recently accessed cylinder (prior
to the loading of VFAT) on the hard disk drive is displayed in the viewing
window.
