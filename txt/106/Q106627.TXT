-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

Central Point Software PC Tools version 6.0 PC Shell may not be able to reliably
read DoubleSpace drives. If it cannot, it may show no files or directories on
the compressed drive, or it may show a corrupted directory tree.

When this problem occurs, if you use PC Shell to perform any actions that write
to the drive, the drive may become corrupted.

CAUSE
=====


RESOLUTION
==========

If you encounter this problem, do not try to write to or modify the drive. Exit
PC Shell and contact Central Point Software Technical Support for additional
information.

NOTE: This problem can also affect uncompressed drives that have 256 sectors per
FAT. This includes uncompressed drives that are 128 MB, 256 MB, 512 MB, 1024 MB,
or 2048 MB in size.
