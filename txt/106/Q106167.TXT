======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When you access shares on a Windows NT server from a Windows NT client and the
IRPstackSize parameter is set too low on the server, you may receive the
following error message:

   Not enough server storage is available to process this command.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The registry value IRPstackSize, which may be listed at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
SYSTEM\ CurrentControlSet\ Services\ LanmanServer\ Parameters defaults to 0x4 if
the value is not explicitly present. Valid values range from 0x1 to 0xC (1 to
12). Depending on the hardware configuration of a specific machine, the default
value may not be large enough for the Srv service to properly administer shared
directories on some of the physical drives. You may see one or both of the
following event messages:

   Event ID: 2011  Source: Srv
   The server's configuration parameter "irpstacksize" is too small for
   the server to use a local device.  Please increase the value of this
   parameter.

   Event ID: 0
   Source SRV
   Description:  Description for Event ID 0 could not be found.  It
   contains the insertion string \device\LanManServer

You may receive one of the above error message when a Windows NT client tries to
access certain shared directories on such a server.

When a Windows for Workgroups client tries to access the same shared directories,
the following message will be generated:

   Path not found.

To increase the value of the parameter when it is not already present, go to the
key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\
LanmanServer\Parameters. The value of IRPStackSize defaults to 0x4 if it is not
explicitly present. If the key is not present, choose Add Value in the Registry
Editor. The Value Name should be IRPStackSize and the Data Type is REG_DWORD..

If you are encountering this error message, try gradually increasing the value of
IrpStackSize in order to find the minimal value which resolves the problem.
Using a value that is larger than necessary can result in an unnecessary waste
of system resources. Other factors can also lead to this error message. If
problems persist with all legal values for IrpStackSize, restore IrpStackSize to
its original value and another explanation for the error must be sought.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.


If you receive this error message and you are running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0,
