TITLE   :FIX: Incorrect Path Causes Setup Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After confirming the installer's name and organization, the FORTRAN PowerStation
Setup program stops and displays the following message box:

   Setup program files have been modified or corrupted

After displaying an additional warning that the PowerStation did not successfully
install, the Setup program terminates.

CAUSE
=====

The path environment variable specified a Windows directory that does not
include the drive specification.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that in the PATH statement, the directory specified for Windows
contains the drive letter. In general, all directories in the PATH statement
should be fully specified, including the drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation
version 1.0 for MS-DOS. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN PowerStation
maintenance release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more" (without the
quotation marks) from \F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN
PowerStation 1.0 and will show version 1.0f for the maintenance realease version
1.0a.

The PATH statement below does not specify a drive letter for the Windows
directory, and therefore installation fails:

   path=c:\dos;\windows

Installation succeeds if the PATH is modified to contain the drive letter as is
shown below:

   path=c:\dos;c:\windows

Additional query words: 1.00
