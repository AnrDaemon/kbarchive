The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Undelete Delete Tracking is enabled, you cannot undelete a zero-byte file.

WORKAROUND
==========

You may be able to undelete the file by using the Undelete /DOS command as
follows:

1. Change to the directory that contains the deleted file.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following command and press ENTER:

   " undelete *.* /dos" (without the quotation marks)

If one of your applications (such as Lotus 1-2-3) uses a zero-byte file and you
cannot undelete it, contact your software vendor for assistance in replacing the
file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS Undelete versions 6.0,
6.2, and 6.21. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
