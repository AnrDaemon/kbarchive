PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Mail Administrator upgrades a version 2.1x Microsoft Mail for
PC Networks postoffice to version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail without upgrading the
administrative executable files, inaccurate messages may be displayed when the
Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) is run.

CAUSE
=====

The setup program included with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
allows you to upgrade the postoffice, to upgrade the administrative executable
files, or both.

If the administrative executable files are not upgraded, the error message files
ERRORADM.GLB and ERRORDYN.GLB will not be updated. This causes invalid or
inaccurate error messages.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, either copy the files from a 3.2 postoffice in which
the executable files were updated, or extract the files from Disk 2 - Server
Programs.
