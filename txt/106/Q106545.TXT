SUMMARY
=======

The Services for Macintosh utilities in the Windows NT Resource Kit allow
administrators to remotely administer their Windows NT Advanced Server from
their Windows NT workstations. If you already have Windows NT Advanced Server on
your local machine, it doesn't give you any new functionality.

The utilities also allow developers to write to the Microsoft AppleTalk stack
with Windows Sockets and have the protocol stack to test on their Windows NT
workstations without having Windows NT Advanced Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The administrator tool setup adds MacFile entries for your local Server Manager
and File Manager menus. The Windows NT Resource Kit DOES NOT support MacFile;
that is, it does not install the MacFile server on your local machine. This is
contrary to the misleading statement on page 437 in volume 1 of the Resource
Kit.

The AppleTalk stack is also provided in the Windows NT Resource Kit to allow
developers who do not purchase Windows NT Advanced Server to develop
applications using Windows Sockets for AppleTalk. Essentially, the AppleTalk
component in the Resource Kit is targeted at Windows NT installations only;
Windows NT Advanced Server includes all the necessary tools to build Windows
Sockets applications for AppleTalk.
