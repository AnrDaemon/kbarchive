-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to install the MS-DOS Upgrade packages from a network server;
this provides a more efficient way to upgrade multiple workstations.

This article covers the following topics:

 - Putting Unexpanded MS-DOS Files on the Network Server

 - Putting MS-DOS Files on a Server to Upgrade a Diskless Workstation

NOTE: These procedure do not change your licensing agreement. You still must have
one copy of MS-DOS (or a license) for each computer on which you install
MS-DOS.

Putting Unexpanded MS-DOS Files on the Network Server
-----------------------------------------------------

To put the unexpanded MS-DOS files on a network server:

1. Create a directory on the server (for example, DOS62).

2. Copy all the files from each MS-DOS Upgrade disk to that directory.

Instead of upgrading from floppy disk, each user on the network can now upgrade
his or her workstation from the network server.

Putting MS-DOS Files on a Server to Upgrade a Diskless Workstation
------------------------------------------------------------------

To install MS-DOS Upgrade on a diskless workstation, most network administrators
copy the MS-DOS files to the network and then prepare boot images.

If you have MS-DOS 5.0, you can copy the expanded MS-DOS files to the network
using one of the following methods:

 - Install MS-DOS 5.0 on a workstation that has both a floppy disk drive and a
   hard disk and then copy the MS-DOS files to the network server.

-or-

 - Using a workstation that has a floppy disk drive, run SETUP /F to install all
   MS-DOS program files to floppy disks and then copy the MS-DOS files to the
   network server.

If you have MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2, you can copy the expanded MS-DOS file to the
network using one of the following methods:

 - Install MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 on a workstation that has both a floppy disk drive
   and a hard disk and then copy the MS-DOS files to the network server.

-or-

 - Using a workstation that has both a floppy disk drive and a hard disk, run
   SETUP /Q to expand the MS-DOS files to a network drive. Using this method
   does not install the optional MS-DOS programs (Microsoft Backup, Microsoft
   Anti-Virus, Microsoft Undelete).

   NOTE: MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2 SETUP /F create only one disk containing a few of the
   MS-DOS files and therefore are not useful for putting the MS-DOS files on a
   network server.
