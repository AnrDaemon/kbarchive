======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you print to a shared Microsoft Windows for Workgroups printer, your
computer stops responding, or hangs. The print job finishes successfully.

CAUSE
=====

When you share a printer on a Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 computer, the
default configuration for the printer is to send printer alerts through the
Print Manager. These alerts can sometimes cause a computer to hang.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, disable printer alerts by adding the following
entry to the [Network] section of the SYSTEM.INI file on the print server:

   SendPrintMessages=no

NOTE: Disabling WinPopup does not disable printer alerts since these messages are
sent through Print Manager. The only way to disable printer alerts is to add the
line described above.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
