TITLE   :FIX: Debugger Error EE0044 for Arrays If Lower Bound Not 1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Locals and the Watch windows show error EE0044 instead of the values in an
array declared with lower bounds other than 1.

RESOLUTION
==========

If possible, EQUIVALENCE the array with lower bounds other than 1 with a
same-sized array with lower bounds of 1. Then view the elements in the array
with the lower bounds of 1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0
for MS-DOS. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN PowerStation maintenance
release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more" (without the
quotation marks) from \F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN
PowerStation version 1.0, and it will show version 1.0f for the maintenance
release version 1.0a.

Neither the Locals nor the Watch window can display the values in an array
declared with lower bounds other than 1. For example a(10) and b(1:20) work but
c(-1:5), d(0:34), and e(4:8) do not work.

Regardless of the actual declared lower bound, if it is not 1, then the debugger
will attempt to display the array as if the lower bound were 0 (zero). For
example, with A declared as A(2:4), the debugger will display five elements:
A(0) to A(4).

To demonstrate the problems:

1. Build the sample code with the project in debug mode.

2. Step to the print statement. At this point all three elements of ARR are
   100.3.

3. In the Watch window, enter "ARR" (without the quotation marks) and "ARR(2)"
   (without the quotation marks).

4. Click "+ARR = {...}" to display the full array. At this point the Watch
   window will show:

         -ARR
            (ARR)(0) = EE0044 Error: Type error.
            (ARR)(1) = EE0044 Error: Type error.
            (ARR)(2) = EE0044 Error: Type error.
            (ARR)(3) = EE0044 Error: Type error.
            (ARR)(4) = EE0044 Error: Type error.
          ARR(2) = EE0044 Error: Type error.

5. Open the Locals window. ARR will be displayed the same way.

Sample Code
-----------

   C Project options needed: Debug mode

         real arr(2:4)
         arr = 100.3
         print*, arr(2)
         end
