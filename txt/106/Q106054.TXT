-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the frame type being used on your Novell NetWare server is not set to
Ethernet_802.3, SPX-compatible applications, such as RConsole, may not work
correctly under Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

For example, if you start the RConsole application, some servers may be missing
from the list of servers to administer. This problem occurs if the server's
frame type is set to Ethernet_II, Ethernet_802.2, or Ethernet_SNAP.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Windows for Workgroups server defaults to the
802.3 frame type.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, choose the Network Setup icon and change the frame type
for the Windows for Workgroups IPX/SPX-compatible protocol to the same frame
type as the NetWare server.
