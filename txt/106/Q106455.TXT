The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

The code samples below demonstrate how to retrieve a list of pointers to all
open CDocument (and CDocument-derived objects) created by a CWinApp-derived
object. For MFC versions 3.x and below, Sample Code 1 shows the use of
CWinApp::m_templateList, CDocTemplate::GetFirstDocPosition(), and
CDocTemplate::GetNextDoc(). For MFC version 4.0, Sample Code 2 provides a
similar implementation, but uses CWinApp::GetFirstDocTemplatePosition() and
CWinApp::GetNextDocTemplate() to obtain the valid CDocTemplate pointers.

For both code samples, CMyApp is derived from CWinApp. Moreover, once a valid
CDocTemplate pointer is obtained, CDocTemplate::GetFirstDocPosition() and
CDocTemplate::GetNextDoc() are used in both samples to iterate through the list
of open documents for each document template. For MFC versions 3.x and earlier,
an application object's list of document template pointers is contained in
CWinApp::m_templateList, a CPtrList object. Sample Code 1 makes use of this
fact. For MFC version 4.0, CWinApp uses a CDocManager to maintain its list of
document templates and provides the GetFirstDocTemplatePosition() and
GetNextDocTemplate() member functions to traverse the list. Sample Code 2
exhibits this.

Sample Code 1 - MFC 3.x and prior
---------------------------------

   /* Compile options needed: none
   */ 

   void CMyApp::GetDocumentList(CObList * pDocList)
   {
      ASSERT(pDocList->IsEmpty());

      POSITION pos = m_templateList.GetHeadPosition();

      while (pos)
      {
         CDocTemplate* pTemplate = (CDocTemplate*)m_templateList.GetNext(pos);
         POSITION pos2 = pTemplate->GetFirstDocPosition();
         while (pos2)
         {
            CDocument * pDocument;
            if ((pDocument=pTemplate->GetNextDoc(pos2)) != NULL)
               pDocList->AddHead(pDocument);
         }
      }
   }

Sample Code 2 - MFC 4.0
-----------------------

   /* Compile options needed: none
   */ 

   void CMyApp::GetDocumentList(CObList * pDocList)
   {
      ASSERT(pDocList->IsEmpty());

      POSITION pos = GetFirstDocTemplatePosition();

      while (pos)
      {
         CDocTemplate* pTemplate = (CDocTemplate*)GetNextDocTemplate(pos);
         POSITION pos2 = pTemplate->GetFirstDocPosition();
         while (pos2)
         {
            CDocument * pDocument;
            if ((pDocument=pTemplate->GetNextDoc(pos2)) != NULL)
               pDocList->AddHead(pDocument);
         }
      }
   }

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Visual C++ version 4.0 Books Online document all of the following
functions:

 - CWinApp::GetFirstDocTemplatePosition

 - CWinApp::GetNextDocTemplate

 - CDocTemplate::GetFirstDocPosition

 - CDocTemplate::GetNextDoc

However, the GetFirstDocPosition and GetNextDoc member functions of CDocTemplate
are not documented in previous versions of Visual C++. These public member
functions are defined in the CDocTemplate class and provide simple functionality
for traversing the list of open documents as shown above. These functions
operate as follows:

CDocTemplate::GetFirstDocPosition Function:

Declaration: virtual POSITION GetFirstDocPosition() const;

Remarks:
Call this function to get the position of the first document in the list of open
documents associated with the template.

Return Value:
A POSITION value that can be used for iteration with the GetNextDoc member
function.

CDocTemplate::GetNextDoc Funcation:

Declaration: virtual CDocument* GetNextDoc(POSITION& rPosition) const;

rPosition:
A reference to a POSITION value returned by a previous call to the GetNextDoc or
GetFirstDocPosition member function. This value must not be NULL.

Remarks:
Call this function to iterate through all of the document template's open
documents. The function returns the document identified by rPosition and then
sets rPosition to the POSITION value of the next document in the list. If the
retrieved document is the last in the list, then rPosition is set to NULL.

Return Value:
A pointer to the view identified by rPosition.
