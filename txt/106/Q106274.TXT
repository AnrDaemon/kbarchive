TITLE   :Certain Network Adapters Can Use DMA Channels 0-3 Only
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 with a network
adapter that uses direct memory access (DMA) in Slave DMA mode, only DMA
channels 0, 1, 2, and 3 can be used.

NOTE: An example of a network adapter that uses Slave DMA mode is the
Hewlett-Packard 27248A EtherTwist card.

If the card operates in Master DMA mode, it can work on any available DMA
channel.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is due to a limitation in the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Virtual
Direct Memory Access driver (VDMAD).

WORKAROUND
==========

The only workaround is to use DMA channel 0, 1, 2, or 3 for your network
adapter.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11 VDMAD driver. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
