TITLE   :WFWG Err Msg: The 32-Bit File System Is Incompatible...SUBST
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you enable 32-bit file access and you use the MS-DOS substitute command
(SUBST), one of the following symptoms occurs when you start your system:

 - Your system stops responding (hangs) at a black screen after displaying the
   Windows for Workgroups logo.

   -or-

 - You receive the following error message:

   The 32-bit file system is incompatible with the SUBST utility. To use 32-bit
   file access, do not use the SUBST utility before starting Windows for
   Workgroups.

CAUSE
=====

The SUBST utility from MS-DOS allows you to substitute drive letters for
directory names. This method of redirection is incompatible with 32-bit file
access. When IFSMGR.386 detects SUBST, it prevents 32-bit file access from
loading to protect against data loss.

IMPORTANT: It is important to note that 32-bit file access is disabled for all
drives, not just the substituted drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

This error message is by design.

If you use 32-bit file access, you cannot use the SUBST command. To use the SUBST
command, you must first disable 32-bit file access.

Note that the following message is displayed if SUBST is used in an MS-DOS
virtual machine (VM) with 32-bit file access enabled:

   Cannot SUBST a network drive

This error message appears regardless of whether you are using a stand- alone
machine or one on a network.
