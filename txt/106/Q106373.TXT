The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When the number of mouse or keyboard events buffered internally by the driver in
nonpaged pool memory is too low, one of the following error messages gets logged
in the Event Viewer:

   

   Source      Category      Event      User
   -----------------------------------------
   Mouclass    None          11         N/A

   -or-

   Source      Category      Event      User
   -----------------------------------------
   i8042prt    None          12         N/A

Both of the above error messages have the following description:

   The ring buffer that stores incoming mouse data has overflowed (buffer
   size is configurable through the Registry).

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

Use the Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) to edit the following entry:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/i8042prt/Parameters

Make the value for KeyboardDataQueueSize and/or MouseDataQueueSize larger.

NOTE: The default value for both of these is 64.

The above service (i8042prt) name may vary, depending the type of mouse you are
using.

Note: If changing the registry does not solve the behavior, disable the NetFlex
adapter driver from the devices. With some of the NetFlex adapters, if the card
is not disabled, the events can occur and the computer may stop responding.
