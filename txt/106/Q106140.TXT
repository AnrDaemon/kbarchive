TITLE   :Cannot Run 32-Bit File Access with NE2000 ODI Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you load the Novell NE2000.COM ODI driver and use 32-bit file access with
the real-mode mapper (RMM.D32), you may experience a five- second delay when
loading applications from the Windows GUI interface. (This delay does not occur
when loading MS-DOS-based applications from an MS-DOS virtual machine [VM].)
This may also cause Windows for Workgroups to load more slowly.

CAUSE
=====

This delay occurs because the NE2000.COM driver is causing RMM.D32 to generate a
time-out, and the time-out value is hard coded to be five seconds. Once the
application loads, it then runs as fast as it should because it has been stored
in cache memory (VCACHE.386).

This problem is in the NE2000.COM MLID and only occurs when IPXODI, which is
needed to access NetWare servers, is loaded.

The NE2000 MLIDs known to cause this problem are from the Novell DOSUP7 client
files dated 1/18/93, DOSUP8 client files dated 7/30/93, and version 1.34 dated
6/3/91.
