TITLE   :BUG: RUNQQ Generates DX1420 for MS-DOS Extended Tools
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

RUNQQ generates the following error message when it invokes any executable that
requires the MS-DOS extended utility shipped with Microsoft language products:

   DOSXMSF : fatal error DX1420: cannot load program : invalid or corrupted .EXE
   file

For example, RUNQQ cannot execute the MS-DOS extended utilities such as NMAKE,
FL32, and LINK32, that are shipped with Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for
MS-DOS, version 1.0 and 1.0a.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS,
version 1.0 and 1.0a.

This is not a problem with FORTRAN PowerStation 32.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample program generates DX1420 when RUNQQ executes the MS-DOS
extended utility FL32.EXE. RUNQQ does not cause any problems when it spawns
16-bit programs and utilities.

Sample Code
-----------

   C No compiler options required
          include 'flib.fi'
          include 'flib.fd'
          i = runqq('fl32',' ')
          print '(A,I3)',' Return Code:', i
          end

The following output is produced when the above program is executed:

   DOSXMSF : fatal error DX1420: cannot load program : invalid or corrupted .EXE
   file
   Additional info: "C:\F32\BIN\fl32.exe"
   Return Code: 11
