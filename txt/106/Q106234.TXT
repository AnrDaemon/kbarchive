The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You check the "Remember Password" box in Windows for Workgroups Mail, but you
are still prompted for a password when you start Mail.

CAUSE
=====

Workgroups Mail uses the <username>.PWL file to cache (remember) the mail
password. If the network was not started, you do not have a network installed,
or there is no <username>.PWL file, the Workgroups Mail password cannot be
cached.


WORKAROUND
==========

To make sure that the password is remembered regardless of the network state,
add the following entry to your MSMAIL.INI file:

      [Microsoft Mail]
      Password=<password>

This entry forces Workgroups Mail to bypass the normal sign-in. Note, however,
that this entry allows anyone to access your mail file.
