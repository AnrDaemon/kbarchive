-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to print from a Windows for Workgroups computer to a Windows NT
computer that is sharing a printer on the network, the first print job prints,
but subsequent print jobs cause the following error to appear on the Windows for
Workgroups computer:

   !ERROR in Print Manager

Quitting and restarting Windows for Workgroups allows the computer to print
again, but the error appears again after the first print job.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be due to the Windows for Workgroups computer running Banyan
VINES software in addition to Windows for Workgroups.

Banyan VINES adds the following lines to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file of the Windows for
Workgroups computer:

      ban /nc
      redirall
      arswait
      Z:login
      Z:setmsgs off

In addition, Banyan VINES adds the following lines to the Windows for Workgroups
computer's SYSTEM.INI:

      [Boot]
      secondnet=vines.drv
      [386 enh]
      secondnet=vvinesd.386

      [network]
      multinet=vines500

RESOLUTION
==========

Removing the Banyan VINES software from the Windows for Workgroups computer.

The Banyan product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
