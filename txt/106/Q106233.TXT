The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 does not support
standard mode. However, the standard mode video grabber files from
previous versions of Microsoft Windows or Windows for Workgroups may
remain on the computer after version 3.11 is installed, as these files
are not updated or deleted by Windows for Workgroups Setup.

To increase available disk space, you can delete the standard mode
grabber files from your hard disk. Standard mode grabber files
typically have an extension of .GR2 or .2GR and are located in the
Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

NOTE: The active enhanced mode video grabber file is identified in the
"386Grabber=" line of the SYSTEM.INI file [Boot] section. This file
must remain in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory for Windows or Windows
for Workgroups to function properly.

Additional query words: 286Grabber 3.11
