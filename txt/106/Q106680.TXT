TITLE   :SFM: Macintosh Users Not Logged Off Despite Time Restrictions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Advanced Server allows for Logon Time Restrictions to be set on User
accounts. If a Macintosh client is already logged on to a Windows NT Advanced
Server and the allowable time frame for logging on has expired, that User will
not be logged off from the server and will not receive any messages regarding
time restrictions.

Usually, if the Time Restrictions expire, a User would be logged off and receive
a message stating their time restrictions have expired. However, once a
Macintosh client is logged on, any Time Restrictions set on the User account do
not apply until the User logs off and tries to log back on.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Advanced Server
version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
