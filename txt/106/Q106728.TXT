TITLE   :BUG: DX1010 Running PowerStation Application from NMAKE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using an MS-DOS extended version of NMAKE, the DOSXNT error

   DOSXNT : fatal error DX1010: DOS-Extended applications nested too deeply

occurs when attempting to run an application built with FORTRAN PowerStation from
the makefile.

CAUSE
=====

FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS comes with two MS-DOS extenders:

DOSXMSF.EXE -- This is the MS-DOS extender used by programs created with the
FORTRAN PowerStation.

DOSXNT.EXE -- This is the MS-DOS extender loaded by PowerStation utilities such
as NMAKE and FL32.

The DX1010 error occurs when attempting to load one MS-DOS extender while the
other MS-DOS extender is in memory. These two MS-DOS extenders are not
compatible (see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q106567 for more
information on the incompatibility between DOSXNT.EXE and DOSXMSF.EXE).

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two alternatives to avoid the conflict:

 - Do not use a version of NMAKE that loads DOSXNT.EXE.

 - Compile the programs that are run from the makefile with FORTRAN version 5.1
   or earlier.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0
and 1.0a for MS-DOS.

This is not a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation 32.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Running NMAKE that ships with the FORTRAN PowerStation on the sample makefile
below generates the DX1010 error when attempting to run HELLO.EXE:

Sample Makefile
---------------

   run: hello.exe
      hello
   hello.exe:
      fl32 <<hello.for
          print *, 'Hello'
          end
   <<KEEP
