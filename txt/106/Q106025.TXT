======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure Windows for Workgroups for a Novell/Anthem NE2000 card, you
can select an IRQ between 2 and 5 (inclusive)--even though the newer
Novell/Anthem NE2000 cards support IRQs 2-14.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows for Workgroups NETWORKS.INF file contains 2-5 as a valid IRQ range
for Novell/Anthem NE2000 cards to maintain compatibility with older cards.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have one of the newer Novell/Anthem cards (or a clone) and you are using
an IRQ in the 6-14 range, do one of the following:

 - Select "NE2000 Compatible" instead of "Novell/Anthem NE2000" when configuring
   Windows for Workgroups.

   -or-

 - Edit the PROTOCOL.INI file and change the IRQ to the correct value.
