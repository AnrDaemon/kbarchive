TITLE   :DBLSPACE /UNCOMPRESS Does Not Remove DBLSPACE.SYS Entry
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the DBLSPACE /UNCOMPRESS command to uncompress the last mounted
compressed drive, DoubleSpace may not remove the DBLSPACE.SYS line from the
CONFIG.SYS file.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when any portion of the DBLSPACE.SYS line contains one or
more lowercase letters. For example, the following line would not be removed
because of the lowercase letter e:

   DeVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.SYS /MOVE

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, edit the CONFIG.SYS file and manually remove the
DBLSPACE.SYS line.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DBLSPACE.SYS line contains lowercase characters only if it has been modified
by a user. If this line remains in the CONFIG.SYS file, DoubleSpace does not
generate an error message or alert the user of any problems when you boot.
Although it is present in the CONFIG.SYS file, the DoubleSpace driver does not
load into memory because DBLSPACE.BIN has been removed from the root directory
of the boot drive.
