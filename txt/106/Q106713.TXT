TITLE   :Incorrect I/O Address Detected on SMC Elite+ Network Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are upgrading to Windows for Workgroups 3.11 on a system that is running
Microsoft Workgroup Connections 1.0 and has an SMC Elite+ network adapter, the
correct I/O address may not be detected for the SMC adapter.

If the SMC Elite+ network adapter is not configured to use the default 0x280h I/O
address, you must select the correct setting when Setup prompts you for
confirmation.

CAUSE
=====

To determine the I/O address for the network adapter, Windows for Workgroups
3.11 Setup examines the existing PROTOCOL.INI file in use by Workgroup
Connections 1.0. If the network adapter is an SMC Elite+, the I/O address is not
found in the PROTOCOL.INI file. (The SMC Elite+ NDIS2 driver for use with
Workgroup Connections 1.0 does not require that an I/O address be stored in the
PROTOCOL.INI file.)

Since an I/O address is not found in the PROTOCOL.INI file, the default I/O
address of the SMC Elite+ network adapter is selected and you are given an
opportunity to confirm this selection.
