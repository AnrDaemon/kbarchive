-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

After using MS-DOS 6.2 DoubleSpace to uninstall DoubleSpace, you may receive the
following error message:

   Warning: unable to use a disk cache on the specified drive

This problem occurs when you have configured SMARTDrive to specifically cache the
DoubleSpace host drive. For example:

   <c>:\> smartdrv /x <h> 512 512

where <c> is your DoubleSpace-compressed drive and <h> is your host
drive.

CAUSE
=====

The DoubleSpace Uninstall program does not adjust the drive letters on the
SMARTDRV.EXE command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file after uncompressing your
DoubleSpace-compressed drives.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and specify the correct
drive.
