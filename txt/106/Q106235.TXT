KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience a general protection (GP) fault in Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups File Manager when you access files on a Beame & Whiteside Network
File System (BW-NFS) network drive.

CAUSE
=====

BW-NFS is capable of storing files with names longer than the MS-DOS limit of 8
characters plus a 3 character extension. You may receive the GP fault if this
long file name support feature is enabled on the BW-NFS server where BW-NFS is
installed as a primary or secondary network for Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

Note that the name of the file being manipulated does not have to exceed the
MS-DOS file name limits to cause this error.

WORKAROUND
==========

Disable the long file name support on the BW-NFS network server.

Additional query words: LFN parse longname 3.11 filename
