SYMPTOMS
========

After DoubleSpace compresses a drive on your system, it may report there is a
disk error on more than one drive, and that there are zero bytes free on the
newly created drive. For example, after DoubleSpace has finished compressing
drive C, you may receive the following series of error messages (each is
displayed after choosing OK):

   Dblspace has finished compressing this drive. However, some files were not
   compressed, because there was not enough disk space for more information
   press F1.

   Dblspace cannot examine drive C: There is a disk error on drive C: To fix it
   type ScanDisk c: at the command prompt.

   Dblspace cannot mount drive H: There is a disk error on drive H: to fix it,
   type ScanDisk H: at the command prompt.

   Dblspace cannot examine drive H: There is not enough conventional memory to
   complete this operation for more information on freeing memory, see the
   MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.

   Dblspace has created a new drive H: that contains 0.0 MB of uncompressed
   space.

CAUSE
=====

DoubleSpace checks for the presence of Delete Sentry only when DBLSPACE.BIN is
loaded in memory. Therefore, Delete Sentry causes the error noted above when you
compress your first DoubleSpace drive.

This problem occurs because when DoubleSpace checks for free disk space, it does
not take into account the hidden Delete Sentry directory.

When DoubleSpace reboots your computer, Delete Sentry is not loaded and there is
insufficient space to compress your drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and remark out UNDELETE /SENTRY. For example:

      REM UNDELETE /SENTRY

2. Restart your computer.

3. Run DoubleSpace Uncompress. For example, type "dblspace /uncompress c:"
   (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press
   ENTER.

4. Recompress drive C. For example, type "dblspace /compress c" (without the
   quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

5. Edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and restore the UNDELETE /SENTRY command.

6. Restart your computer.
