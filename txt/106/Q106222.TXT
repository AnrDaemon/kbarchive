SUMMARY
=======


Hotfix CSD00.059 allows LAN Manager Remoteboot to work with MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2.


MORE INFORMATION
================

MS-DOS 6 requires slightly more memory than MS-DOS 5. LAN Manager Remoteboot
failed with MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2 because some rpl boot block components (mainly
RPLDISK.SYS) placed executing code in unprotected memory, where it was
overwritten by the MS-DOS 6 boot process. (Other components were also affected.)
RPLDISK.SYS is now in another location in memory.

Install these fixed/new files immediately after installing LAN Manager and before
executing the rplsetup/rplinst step. If you add them to an existing rpl server,
re-run rplinst to set the permissions up correctly.

No changes are needed to LANMAN\RPL\RPL.MAP. OS/2 rpl is not affected, and no
files specific to it need to change. MS-DOS 6.2 support is also included.
