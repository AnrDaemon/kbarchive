TITLE   :Backup Err Msg: Backup Requires Configuration for This...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Starting Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS (MSBACKUP.EXE) opens the following
configuration screen after an initial backup configuration has already been
performed:

   Backup requires configuration for this computer.

CAUSE
=====

This message appears for one of three reasons:

 - This is the first time Backup has been run.

 - Backup cannot locate the MSBACKUP.INI file in the MS-DOS subdirectory.

 - The A and/or B drive(s) have been changed from high density to low density
   (or vice versa).

RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate this error, perform the Backup configuration again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first time you run Backup, you are required to perform a configuration
setup. This creates the files MSBACKUP.INI, MSBACKUP.TMP, MSBACKUP.RST,
MSBACKUP.LOG, DEFAULT.SET, DEFAULT.SLT, and DEFAULT.CAT in the MS-DOS
directory.

You must perform the configuration setup again if the MSBACKUP.INI file is
removed from the MS-DOS directory or if the physical removable drive, A or B, is
changed from high density to low density or vice-versa.
