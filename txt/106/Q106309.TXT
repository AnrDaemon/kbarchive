The Chat application in Windows NT is similar to the Chat application
in Windows for Workgroups, except that Windows NT Chat prompts you for
a password when you call a machine on a different domain, on which you
do not have an account.

After you enter your password, however, you will receive an "invalid
password" error message. If you know a user name and the password on
the remote domain or machine, you can use the Connect As dialog box to
enter that information and communicate with the remote machine.
Another option is to log on as a guest if the remote machine has the
guest account enabled.

If both domains have the same user name but different passwords, you
will not be able to communicate with the other machine.
