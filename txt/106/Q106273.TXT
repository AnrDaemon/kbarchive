======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you exit and then restart Microsoft Windows on a system with an older AMD
NE1500T network interface card (NIC), you cannot communicate over the network.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs on AM1500T NICs that use the Lance chip. AM1500T NICs that
use the PC-NET chip do not exhibit this behavior.

WORKAROUND
==========

You need to power your system off and then on (cold boot) before restarting
Windows. You should then be able to communicate over the network.
