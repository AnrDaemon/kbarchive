SUMMARY
=======

When you transport FoxPro applications between character-based and graphic-
based environments, you must convert the row and column positions of screen
objects appropriately, as explained below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In FoxPro for MS-DOS, objects are placed based on row and column positions. The
size of each row and column remains constant, since only one screen font is
available. However, in FoxPro for Windows and FoxPro for the Macintosh, row and
column sizes will vary based on the current font and the current resolution of
the screen.

In order to provide a consistent unit of measurement and accurate placement of
objects between platforms, foxels were developed. Foxels are simply fractional
rows and columns, expressed in decimal form. A foxelrow is used to indicate a
single vertical row of characters. A foxelcol is used to indicate a single
horizontal character.

The size of a foxelrow will vary depending on the height of the current font. The
number of foxelrows available can be determined with the SROWS() function. The
size of a foxelcol will vary depending on the average width of characters in the
current font. The number of foxelcols available can be determined with the
SCOLS() function.

The algorithm to determine pixel-to-foxel conversion is:

      FUNCTION _pix2fox
         PARAMETER m.apixel,m.dimension
         RETURN m.apixel/FONTMETRIC(IIF(UPPER(m.dimension) = "H",6,1))

The following two parameters are passed to the function:

 - M.APIXEL indicates the pixel position.

 - M.DIMENSION indicates a "V" for vertical values and an "H" for horizontal
   values.

Usage
-----

      myfoxelrow = _pix2fox(pixvalnum,"V") && for vertical (row) values
      myfoxelcol = _pix2fox(pixvalnum,"H") && for horizontal (col) values

The algorithm for foxelrows divides the pixel position by the character height in
pixels for the current font. The algorithm for foxelcols divides the pixel
position by the average character width in pixels for the current font.
