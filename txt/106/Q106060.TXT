TITLE   :FIX: No "Save Changes" Prompt After Editing a String Table
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbResourceEd kbVC kbVC100bug kbVC150fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The App Studio, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, version 1.0 
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In some situations, App Studio does not detect that a string table resource or
cursor hotspot has been modified, and therefore fails to display a "Save
Changes" prompt. The problem occurs when the user exits App Studio from either
the File or the System menu. If the user has not explicitly saved the string
table or cursor, any changes made to it are lost.

RESOLUTION
==========

To ensure that changes are saved, explicitly save them by choosing Save from the
File menu or by closing the string table editor or cursor editor after making
changes. When you close the string table editor or cursor editor before exiting,
App Studio will display the Save Changes prompt as expected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the beginning
of this article. This bug was corrected in App Studio version 1.5, included with
Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows version 1.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Perform the following four steps to demonstrate the problem:

1. Open a project with a string table or cursor resource.

2. Invoke App Studio and modify one of the string table entries or change the
   cursor hotspot.

3. Choose Exit from the File menu or Close from the System menu without closing
   the string table editor or cursor editor. Note that no "Save Changes" prompt
   is displayed.

4. Reopen App Studio and observe that the string table or hotspot change was
   lost.
