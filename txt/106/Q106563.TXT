TITLE   :FIX: Unary Minus and Mixed Complex*16 with Complex*8
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mixing COMPLEX*16 and COMPLEX*8 variables in an expression using the unary minus
can give the wrong result.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use a unary minus in a mixed COMPLEX expression. Make the minus a binary
operator by subtracting the mixed COMPLEX expression from zero.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0
for MS-DOS. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN PowerStation maintenance
release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more" (without the
quotation marks) from \F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN
PowerStation version 1.0, and it will show version 1.0f for the maintenance
release version 1.0a.

When the following sample code is run, the correct result will be displayed
first:

Sample Code
-----------

   C No compiler options required
           COMPLEX CVAR1,RESLT1,RESLT2
           COMPLEX*16 CVAR2
           CVAR1 = CMPLX(100,0)
           CVAR2 = DCMPLX(100,0)
           RESLT1 = 0 - CVAR1 * CVAR2   ! right result (binary -)
           RESLT2 =  - CVAR1 * CVAR2    ! wrong result (unary -)
           WRITE(*,*) RESLT1,RESLT2
           END
