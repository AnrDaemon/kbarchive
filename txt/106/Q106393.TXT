TITLE   :FIX: Print Footer Options Reset to &P in Visual Workbench
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVCkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Workbench for Windows, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, version 1.5 
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If you choose Page Setup from the File menu in the Visual Workbench and delete
all footer options, the &P option is the default. If you then later choose
Page Setup from the File menu, the &P option returns.

CAUSE
=====

The parser for the Footer options box does not maintain an empty string. If one
is found, the &P option is inserted to include the page number.

You can enter a single space in the options string, which will function the same
as having no options. However, this is maintained only during the current Visual
Workbench session. When the Visual Workbench is executed again, the &P
option is reinserted.

RESOLUTION
==========

Select one of the centering options, &L or &C or &R. Because there
is no other text desired, these options will not have any effect other than to
keep the Visual Workbench from inserting the &P option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Visual Workbench
version 1.0 for Windows and Microsoft Visual Workbench, 32-bit Edition, version
1.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version
2.0.
