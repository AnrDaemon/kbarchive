TITLE   :Diskdump.sys Common Buffer Size Is Changed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows NT computer generates a stop error, a crash dump may not be
created if you are using a Symbios SYMC8xx driver.

The Diskdump.sys driver only allows 8 KB for the common buffer, which may cause a
problem with the Symbios Flint driver. In the Symbios Flint driver, the amount
of NonCachedExtension required may grow significantly. This growth is necessary
to provide all of the necessary tables and scripts storage used to support the
one interrupt for each I/O scripts processing.


CAUSE
=====

Diskdump.sys driver has a hard coded value of 8K for the common buffer.

The Symbios driver was also corrected to resolve a problem with creating
crashdumps on Compaq computers

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


NOTE: For computers running Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server
Edition, you only need to apply the Symc810.sys file from Service Pack 4.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
