   Q160616 FP: Unable to Use Scroll Bar/Page Displayed Incorrectly

 - You cannot enter new text in the "View or Edit HTML" dialog box.

 - When you click OK to close the "View or Edit HTML" dialog box, some of your
   text is deleted.

 - The Show Color Coding check box in the "View or Edit HTML" dialog box is
   selected, but some of the HTML markup is not color coded.

CAUSE
=====

FrontPage 97 Editor does not have internal data structures large enough to
accurately handle very large documents.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft FrontPage
98 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As a general rule, if you cannot enter any additional text, without first
deleting text in the "View or Edit HTML" dialog box, do not click OK or you will
lose some of your text. If you experience any of the problems described in the
"Symptoms" section, you should avoid using the HTML command on the View menu.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, break up the large document into smaller documents
before you use the HTML command on the View menu.
