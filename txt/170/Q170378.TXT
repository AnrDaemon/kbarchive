======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It may be necessary to eliminate SMTP addresses for your entire Microsoft
Exchange Server site. When you delete the addresses on the site addressing
level, you will be unable to edit and change the SMTP attributes on the site
level.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is possible to remove all SMTP addresses on the server level through the
Microsoft Exchange Server Import/Export feature by following these steps:

1. Create a .csv file with the attribute E-mail Addresses.

2. Edit a sample .csv file located on the Exchange Server CD in
   Support\Samples\Csvs\Mailbox, or generate a .csv file by using the Header.exe
   program supplied with the Microsoft Exchange Server Resource Kit.

3. When you use this .csv file and export the server's recipient list, edit
   "SMTP:user@host.ext" by deleting the e-mail address; only "SMTP:" should
   remain.

4. Save the contents and import the new .csv file back to the server.
