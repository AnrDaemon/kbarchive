======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a file share resource within Microsoft Cluster Server, you may be
able to see the share in browse lists under multiple servers.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Cluster Server allows resources to be moved from one server to another
in a cluster. When a network share is defined as a cluster resource, the share
is offered by the server service on a particular cluster node. Because of
multiple network names that may belong to the same computer, shared resources
may appear under these names and may also be accessible through them. This is by
design.

NOTE: It is very important to use the network name associated with the group to
which the shared resource belongs. If the group fails over to another cluster
node, the resource will only be available through the group's network name and
through other network names on the other node. Thus, if a client uses the wrong
network name, it may not re-establish network connections after failover.

Additionally, if you create shares on the server and do not create them as a
resource within the cluster software, the share will not be able to fail over to
another node. Then it is considered a local share.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid client connectivity interruptions, make sure that clients use the
network name associated with the group in which the shared resource belongs.
