SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the users' rights on the root directory of the client computer to
anything lower than change level, users will get an error when they try to use
the FTP command-line utility mget parameter to copy files.

The following is an example of the error:

   Error opening local file s2u.
   >\s2u.:Permission denied
   can't find list of remote files, oops

WORKAROUND
==========

Currently, the only workaround is to give users at least change level rights to
the root drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and
