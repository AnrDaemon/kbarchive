SUMMARY
=======

You can use client pull to set up a timed refresh period for your Web pages.
When you use client pull, you can specify whether to automatically update the
page or whether to proceed to another page after the specified time-out period
has expired.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To implement client pull, enter a special META element in the header of a
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) document. META elements are used within the
header to embed document meta information that is not defined by other HTML
elements. Client pull requires the use of the META element "HTTP- EQUIV" to
implement the update. This element is then returned in the Hypertext Transfer
Protocol (HTTP) response header.

To add a META tag to the header of your HTML page, follow these steps:

1. Start FrontPage Editor.

2. On the File menu, click Page Properties, and then click the Custom tab.

3. In the System Variables (HTTP-EQUIV) section, click Add.

4. In the Name box, type "refresh" (without the quotation marks).

5. In the Value box, type the value you want to use for seconds. For example,
   type "30" (without the quotation marks).

6. Click OK.

7. Click OK again.

   The following code is added to the header of your page:

   <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">

To create a link to another page, repeat the steps above, but in step 5, type the
number of seconds to wait before refreshing, a semicolon and a space, followed
by "URL=newpage.htm" (without the quotation marks). The meta value that
refreshes the Newpage.htm document in five seconds should look like the
following example:

   5; url=newpage.htm

The full line of code should read:

   <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5; url=newpage.htm">

This technique is especially useful when you want to create a slide show effect
with your Web pages.
