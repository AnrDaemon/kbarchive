KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In SNA Server Admin version 2.11 SP1, Security/Owner shows 2 fields, SNA Domain
and Owner. The value displayed in the SNA Domain field is actually the value for
the NT Domain, rather than for the SNA SubDomain.

With SNA Server version 3.0, in SNA Server Manager under Domain Properties/
Config File Security/Take Ownership, the fields are SNA SubDomain and Owner. The
value for SNA SubDomain correctly displays the SNA SubDomain. However, the Owner
field displays the complete NT Domain Name/UserName only in some cases.

For example:

 - If the NT Domain Username and/or Machine account exist in the same domain as
   the domain that the Owner exists in, the Owner field will display only the
   UserName.

 - If the NT Domain Username and/or Machine account exist in a different domain
   than the Owner exists in, the Owner field will display both the NT Domain
   Name and the UserName.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
