======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Some variables in the initialization files require window position values. The
meaning of these values are undocumented and, therefore, described in this
article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may see some of these variables in your ss.ini file:

   Visual_Merge_Rect
   Position_Toolbar
   Hist_Rect
   Visual_Diff_Rect

For example:

   Visual_Merge_Rect (PC) = 139, 172, 876, 654, 1024, 768.
   Hist_Rect (PC) = 233, 206, 766, 542, 1024, 768

The values of the variables, represented in pixels, are translated as follows:

   .ini File Setting = LEFT, TOP, WIDTH, HEIGHT, SCREEN RESOLUTION WIDTH,
   SCREEN RESOLUTION HEIGHT

Reference coordinates are measured from the top-left corner of the computer
screen.
