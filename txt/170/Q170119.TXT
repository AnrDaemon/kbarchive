SUMMARY
=======

The MFC documentation for CDaoRecordset::AddNew() and the DAO SDK documentation
for the AddNew method state:

   The position of the record depends on the type of Recordset:

   In a dynaset-type Recordset object, records are inserted at the end of the
   recordset, regardless of any sorting or ordering rules that may have been in
   effect when the recordset was opened.

The documentation is incorrect. Beginning with Jet 3.0, this behavior is not
guaranteed. The behavior was changed to improve performance as well as
concurrency issues.

To demonstrate the change in behavior, delete a record in a recordset of 300+
records and then call AddNew(). Then, traverse the recordset until you see where
the record has been added. Typically this record will be inserted in the 253rd
record rather than at the end of the recordset.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the goal is to make the newly added record the current record, you should get
the bookmark of the last modified record and move to that bookmark.

This documentation was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0 for Windows.
