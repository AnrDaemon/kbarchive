======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, versions 3.0, 3.5 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components versions 1.5, 2.0, 2.1, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing or upgrading ODBC files, you receive one of the following error
messages:

   The ODBC resource DLL (c:\windows\system\odbcint.dll) is a different version
   than the ODBC driver manager (c:\windows\system\odbc32.dll).

   -or-

   The ODBC resource DLL (c:\windows\system\odbcint.dll) is a different version
   than the ODBC setup dll (c:\windows\system\odbccp32.dll).

   -or-

   The ODBC resource DLL c:\windows\system\odbcint.dll) is a different version
   than the administrator (c:\windows\system\odbcad32.dll).

The message may appear periodically on your screen or when you attempt to open
the ODBC Administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This error is usually caused by outdated or mismatched ODBC components. Many
applications install ODBC, including Visual InterDev, Active Server Pages,
Windows NT 4.0 Service Packs, and many others. During the installation of ODBC,
a service or application may have been using one or more ODBC files. The files
that were in use could not be overwritten, causing a version mismatch between
the files that were in use and either the ODBC Driver Manager or the ODBC
Administrator.

Because the ODBC 3.0 and 3.5 and later Driver Manager performs automatic version
checking between itself and the other ODBC core components, it detects the
version mismatch and generates the warning.


RESOLUTION
==========

Download and install the latest version of the Microsoft Data Access Components
(MDAC). This package updates all ODBC and the newer OLE DB drivers and resources
on the system. The latest version of MDAC can be downloaded from the following
Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/data/download.htm

NOTE: You cannot install MDAC separately in a Windows 2000 computer because MDAC
is part of the system components.

You can also diagnose and reconfigure your current MDAC installation by using the
Component Checker tool. For additional information, click the article number
