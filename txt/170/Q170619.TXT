======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure the ServiceProvider Priority values in the registry to modify
the DNS search order, the search order may not seem to be changed.

CAUSE
=====

A ServiceProvider registry key exists (with associated registry values) at the
following registry location:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP\ 
   ServiceProvider

However, the Winsock code incorrectly references the ServiceProvider registry key
at the following location:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSTCP\ 
   ServiceProvider

RESOLUTION
==========

To workaround this issue, use the following steps: WARNING: Using Registry
Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the
incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own
risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

Create the registry key being referenced by Winsock. To do so, use the following
steps:

1. Use Regedit.exe to open the following location:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services

2. On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click Key. Name the new key MSTCP.

3. Click the new MSTCP key, point to New on the Edit menu, and then click Key.
   Name the new key ServiceProvider. The registry path should look like this:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSTCP\ 
      ServiceProvider

4. Click the new ServiceProvider key, point to New on the Edit menu, and then
   click Binary Value. Create the following new binary values:

    - DnsPriority
    - LocalPriority
    - HostsPriority
    - NetbtPriority.

5. Set the priority values as appropriate.
