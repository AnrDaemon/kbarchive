SUMMARY
=======

In FrontPage Explorer, you can manage access to FrontPage Web files in the
Permissions dialog box on the Tools menu. These permissions are applied at the
Web level only. Tighter control of permissions on subfolders or files is not
available.

By design, when FrontPage Editor saves an edited file, the original file is
deleted and it is replaced by a temporary copy created during the editing
process. When the new file is placed in the directory on the Web server it
inherits the access control settings of the FrontPage Web into which it was
saved.
