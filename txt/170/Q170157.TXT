MORE INFORMATION
================

Returning an Error Value from a DLL
-----------------------------------

To return an error value from a dynamic link library (DLL) procedure, the C
language prototype must be coded so that the return value is an HRESULT. Refer
to the Microsoft Press OLE 2 Programmer's Reference, Volume 2 for more
information on how to do this.

Data Access Guide: DataFormats Tutorial Has Wrong File Extension
----------------------------------------------------------------

The topic named "Format Objects Tutorial" contains a wrong reference to a file
with the extension .mdl. The actual file extension is .udl. For more
information, search online, with Search titles only selected, for "Format
Objects Tutorial" in the MSDN Library Visual Studio 6.0 documentation. The file
in question is listed as "Northwind.mdl," but should be "Northwind.udl."

External Editor Field Added to Options Dialog Box
-------------------------------------------------

The Advanced tab of the Options dialog box has a new text box called External
HTML Editor. This option allows you to select the HTML editing program that
appears when you select Launch Editor from either the DHTML Page Designer or the
Webclass Designer. You must enter the drive, path, and executable name of the
program you want to use. You can choose an HTML editing program, a word
processing program, or the text editor you prefer to use.

CodeBase Fixup Utility in Internet Component Download
-----------------------------------------------------

The "Downloading ActiveX Components" section of the Building Internet
Applications book makes reference to a utility called the CodeBase Fixup Utility
that can be used to manually set codebase information in an ActiveX document.
This information is incorrect. The utility is not shipped in the \Tools
directory with Visual Basic, and you do not need to perform this process
manually for Internet Explorer 4.0 because the Package and Deployment wizard
automatically inserts the appropriate codebase information for these and other
applicable projects.

Text in Project Properties/Open Dialogs Truncated

in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean Versions of Windows
----------------------------------------------------

When you run Visual Basic in the Japanese, Chinese, or Korean version of Windows,
you may notice that text in the Project Properties or Open dialogs is truncated.
If this occurs, shut down Windows, restart it, then restart Visual Basic and the
problem will be fixed.

Avoid Using Repository Add-In with ActiveX Designers
----------------------------------------------------

You should avoid using the Repository add-in with projects that contain ActiveX
designers.

For a complete list of available designers, on the Project menu in Visual Basic,
click Components, and then click the Designers tab in the Components dialog box.
