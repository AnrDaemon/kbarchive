PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::; MACINTOSH:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194330.

SYMPTOMS
========

In FrontPage Editor, when you select a single line and then press DELETE, the
text is deleted, but a blank line remains. In contrast, if you select two or
more lines and press DELETE, both the text and the line space are deleted.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because a single-line selection does not include the
formatting character at the end of the line. When you have multiple lines
selected, the selection contains the formatting character at the end of the
line.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove the blank line, press DELETE again.
