The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Dynamic RAS Connector can be configured to connect two
different Microsoft Exchange Organizations. This article describles some details
that must be configured correctly to get mail flowing in both directions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Exchange Administrator's guide, on page 190, refers to Connected
Sites. To connect two different Organizations, the Connected Sites Property page
of the Dynamic RAS connector must be configured properly. To do this, follow
these steps:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

2. Click the New button to add a new Site.

3. In the dialog that appears, enter in the information about the Site. It is
   important to note that the Organization defaults to your Organization name.
   This entry must be changed to reflect the Organization that you will be
   connecting to.

4. Click the Routing tab and verify that the X.400 routing information matches
   the X.400 Site Addressing of the other Site.

5. Click the OK button to add the Connected Site.

After this is complete, recalculate the routing for the changes to be updated.
Repeat this process on the other Microsoft Exchange Server. Once this is
complete, it will be possible to send mail in both directions. To update the
Global Address List, X.400 custom recipients can be used. This can be obtained
by exporting both Directories and importing them into the other Site. For
information on how to use import, refer to the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152659 XADM: Importing Exchange Accounts from Another Organization

NOTE: Connected Sites should list only those Sites that are directly adjacent to
the connector. Knowledge of all other Sites can only be inherited through
directory replication and directory replication will not occurr between two
different Microsoft Exchange Organizations.
