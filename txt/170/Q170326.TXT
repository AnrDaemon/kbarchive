TITLE   :SNMPUTIL Fails with "invalid oid <oid name> specified" Error Msg
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit utility SNMPUTIL or
another simple network management protocol (SNMP) utility, the command fails
with an "invalid oid <oid name> specified" error message.

For example, when you attempt to perform the following "get" command, an error
occurs:

   C:\PROGRA~1\reskit>snmputil get testmachine public system.sysDescr.0
   Error: Invalid oid, system.sysDescr.0, specified.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by an invalid Mib.bin file in the path.

In the case of the above example, the SNMPUTIL utility uses the Mib.bin file in
its current folder (which is the Mib.bin file that ships with the Windows NT
Server Resource Kit), instead of the Mib.bin file in the %Systemroot%\System32
folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename all Mib.bin files in the path except the one in the %Systemroot%\system32
directory.

After this is completed, the SNMP query will work successfully, as follows:

   C:\PROGRA~1\reskit>snmputil get testmachine public system.sysDescr.0
   Variable = system.sysDescr.0
   Value    = OCTET STRING - Hardware: x86 Family 6 Model 1 Stepping 7
   AT/AT COMPATIBLE  - Software: Windows NT Version 4.0  (Build Number:
   1381 Uniprocessor Free)

This behavior is by design.
