TITLE   :XADM: Individual Public Folder Age Limits Overridden
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The age limit set for the "Age Limit for all folders on this Information Store"
property will override the "All Replicas" property of a specific public folder.
If there is an Age Limit for "This Replica," it works correctly and is not
overridden by the IS PF Age Limit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design. Age limits on public folders can be set in the following
locations:

 - General Tab of the property page of the folder itself. The property is "Age
   Limit for Replica(s).

 - The Age Limits property page of the Public Information Store object. The
   property is "Age Limits for all folders on this Information Store."

 - The Age Limits property page, select the folder in the scroll window, then
   select modify. This will expose a window with properties for This replica and
   for All replicas. Note, by setting all replicas on this page is the same as
   point number 1.

The following is the order of priority:

1. This Replica

2. Age Limit for all folders on this Information Store

3. All Replicas

The reasoning behind this order of priority is that both "This Replica" and "Age
limits for all folders on this Information Store" are controls that affect one
particular server. Having "All Replicas" override "Age limit for all folders in
this Information" impacts multiple servers and makes it more difficult for
administrators of those other servers to control their servers.
