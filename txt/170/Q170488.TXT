SYMPTOMS
========

 - When you use the Windows NT 4.0 SCSI Adapters utility in Control Panel to add
   a new SCSI adapter, the list of SCSI adapters is not displayed and no error
   messages appear.

   -or-

 - When you use the Windows NT 3.51 Add/Remove SCSI Adapter feature of Windows
   NT Setup, you may receive the following error message:

   Setup was unable to locate or load an INF file
   Failed to initialize hardware options
   Badly formed setup Script Command 'goto end'

CAUSE
=====

These problems may occur if the file Scsi.inf is missing, corrupted, or
overwritten by a third-party Scsi.inf file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the Windows NT Expand utility to expand the
Scsi.inf file from the Windows NT CD-ROM to the proper folder. For Windows NT
4.0, place the file in the %SystemRoot%\Inf folder. For Windows NT 3.51, place
the file in the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder.

For example:

Expand d:\i386\SCSI.IN_ c:\winnt40\inf\Scsi.inf

The list of SCSI devices is now available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Additionally, a third-party SCSI driver can be installed from the disk or CD-ROM
provided with the adapter, through the Have Disk option.
