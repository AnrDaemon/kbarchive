======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Some methods and properties of the ActiveX controls included with the Microsoft
Office 97 Developer Edition (ODE) may not be supported when you use them in a
Microsoft Office program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Originally, several Microsoft Visual Basic ActiveX controls were included in the
Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 7.0. Because Office 97 now uses
Visual Basic for Applications as a standard development language across all of
the Office programs, these Visual Basic ActiveX controls are included in the
ODE.

Because these ActiveX controls were created for Visual Basic version 5.0, the
Help files contain information that may be pertinent only when you use these
controls in Visual Basic. Some of the methods and properties of the controls do
not apply when you use them in Office programs. To determine which methods and
properties apply in Office programs, refer to the online Help for the ActiveX
control that you are using.

Because these tools were originally brought over for use in Microsoft Access, the
Help file lists only Microsoft Access, but the support is the same for all
Office programs. If a particular property or method is not supported in
Microsoft Access, it is not supported in any of the other Office programs
either.
