The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

You may receive error PRF1301 when you start the sample FTIME.BAT by syntax
"FTIME test.exe" as described in Help.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Help section "Using PROFILE, PREP, and PLIST" states:

   "If the preceding batch file was named FTIME.BAT, and you wanted to profile
   the program TEST from the Profile dialog box, you would select the Custom
   option, and then specify FTIME.BAT in the Custom Settings box. If you wanted
   to profile the TEST program from the command prompt, you would type: FTIME
   TEST.EXE"

If you use the sample batch file from Help, the following error message appears:

   PREP : fatal error PRF1301: file "test.exe" has an incorrect (old) signature

NOTE: The sample code in Help is different than the ftime.bat shipped with Visual
C++ 5.0. If you invoke the shipped FTIME.BAT with FTIME test.exe, the following
error message appears instead:

   PREP : fatal error PRF1011: cannot open file test.exe.exe

The paragraph should read as follows:

   "If the preceding batch file was named FTIME.BAT, and you wanted to profile
   the program TEST from the Profile dialog box, you would select the Custom
   option, and then specify FTIME.BAT in the Custom Settings box. If you wanted
   to profile the TEST program from the command prompt, you would type: FTIME
   TEST"
