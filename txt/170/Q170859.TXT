TITLE   :Require Secure SSL Channel Option is Not Available
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WinNT:2.0,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate, the Require Secure
SSL Channel option in Internet Service Manager, WWW Service Properties,
Directory Properties is not available (greyed out).

CAUSE
=====

There are several causes of this condition, including:

 - The WWW service has not been stopped and restarted after the certificate was
   installed.

 - No registry entry exists for Sspifilt.dll in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/
   System/CurrentControlSet/Services/W3SVC/Parameters/Filter DLLs.

 - The registry entry above exists, but it includes a space in the full drive
   path description.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

For the causes above, implement the following workarounds, respectively:

1. Stop and restart the WWW service using Internet Service Manager.

2. Open Registry Editor. Open the registry to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/
   System/CurrentControlSet/Services/W3SVC/Parameters/Filter DLLs. Enter the
   full path and file name for Sspifilt.dll file (usually found in the
   %System%\System32\Inetsrv subdirectory) in the registry value by
   double-clicking the value, then entering full path and file name in the
   String Editor. Be sure to confirm that the file exists in the path entered
   into the registry. Close the registry by selecting Registry, Exit, then stop
   and restart the WWW service.

3. If the full path and file name for the Sspifilt.dll file contains any spaces
   in the registry value above, use the String editor to remove the spaces,
   close the registry, then stop and restart the WWW service.
