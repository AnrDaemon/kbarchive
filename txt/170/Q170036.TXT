TITLE   :XCLN:The Mapi Spooler Has Shut Down Unexpectedly
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows Messaging client included with Windows NT Server 4.0 or
Windows NT Workstation 4.0 to send an attached file through Internet e-mail
through a POP3 mail server, the following error message may occur:

   Microsoft Windows Messaging Subsystem: The MAPI Spooler has shut down
   unexpectedly. Close all mail-enabled applications before attempting to log on
   again.

After you shut down and restart the Microsoft Exchange client, you receive the
same message.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused when you send an attached file that has no extension on the
file name. This causes the MAPI spooler to have an access violation when it
attempts to send the file over Internet e-mail. This problem does not occur when
you use an Exchange Server computer as your mail server; it only occurs when
using a POP3/SMTP mail server. When the error occurs, the mail message does not
leave the Outbox so every time the client starts, it tries to send the message,
which causes the MAPI spooler to have another access violattion.
