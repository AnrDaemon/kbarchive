SUMMARY
=======

Tables in a database container are not included in the list of files that can be
added to Source Control. This article describes some of the methods that can be
used to add database tables to Source Control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you add a project to Source Control you do not get an option to add the
tables belonging to any of the databases in the project.

In order to add the tables to Source Control you can do one of the following:

1. Include the Database in the Project.

   NOTE: Once the database is included in the project, when you add the project
   to Source Control the tables will show up in the list of files that can be
   added to Source Control.

2. Add the Tables, individually, into the "Other" section of the project.

   NOTE: Adding the tables to the "Other" section should be done before adding
   the Database to Source Control. In order to modify the tables from within the
   database these tables should be checked out before checking out the database.
