TITLE   :Snacfg.exe /Addpartner Option Fails in SNA 3.0 SP1
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a dependent LU 6.2 session to SNA Server using the Snacfg.exe
command line utility using the /Addpartner option, the process appears to
complete successfully. However, the following message appears when opening SNA
Server Manager after adding the LU:

   Deleting Unpartnered Dependent Lus.

The LU that was added using SNACFG does not appear in SNA Server Manager.

CAUSE
=====

The /Addpartner option in the SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) version of
Snacfg.exe fails to correctly partner the LU specified when writing to the
Com.cfg. Errors in reading partnership records in the Com.cfg lead to problems
when subsequent fields are read.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 SP1. This problem
was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following word in the
