The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Server Message Transfer Agent (MTA) may generate the
following error:

   2194 An MTA database server error was encountered while getting the next
   entry from a queue. Called from MTA. Procedure 162.
   Database error code: ODXOINIU - Object does not exist.
   Queue: 00000000. [DB Server OPERATOR 19 66] (14)

and examining the MTA queues in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program
shows that messages are stuck.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error logged by itself usually occurs after a change to an exisiting
connector or a Microsoft Exchange Server Directory or Information Store recovery
process. The MTA queue in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program will
indicate there are messages waiting to be delivered, however, this is not the
case. The MTA can become overburdened with processing to be done after a
connector change or disaster recovery. Errors that would normally be considered
fatal are actually normal and expected under severe stress. To verify that mail
is indeed flowing; use the Windows NT Performance Monitor (PerfMon) to view the
MTA WorkQ. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start the PerfMon program.

2. On the Edit menu, click Add to Chart.

3. Select the MSExchangeMTA object.

4. Select the Work Queue Length counter.

5. Click the Add button.

If the queue is 0 or there are items in the queue but the number is descreasing,
the MTA is processing messages. If the MTA is functioning, give the Microsoft
Exchange Server 24 to 48 hours to clear out the rogue messages in the MTA
queues.
