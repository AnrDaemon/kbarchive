SUMMARY
=======

Using SNA Server 2.11 Admin program, the number of active users connected to a
particular SNA Server is found under the Server Properties dialog. This includes
the count of active Users, active Sessions, 3270 sessions, APPC sessions, and
LUA sessions.

Using SNA Server 3.0 Manager, this information can be found underneath the SNA
Servers folder as follows:

1. Focus on the "Servers" view by choosing View on the menu bar, then select the
   Servers view.

2. Focus on the "SNA Servers" folder (located underneath the subdomain).

3. Choose the detailed view toolbar option (or choose View on the menu bar and
   then select Details).

SNA Manager will display the active user information for each server in the
subdomain, including the server name, status, active users, active sessions,
active 3270 sessions, active APPC sessions and active LUA sessions.
