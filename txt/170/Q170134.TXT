TITLE   :RASDIAL Error 623 When Dial-up Entry Name Contains Spaces
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Windows NT RASDIAL utility to dial an entry from the
remote access service (RAS) phone book (Windows NT 3.51) or dial-up networking
(Windows NT 4.0), the following error message will be returned if the entry name
contains a space or spaces:

   Error 623 - Cannot find the phone book entry

CAUSE
=====

RASDIAL reads the name entered at the RASDIAL command until it finds a space.
For example, if you have an entry in your RAS phone book called MY ISP and you
attempt to dial it using RASDIAL by entering the following command: RASDIAL MY
ISP, you get the error 623. This is because RASDIAL tries to dial an entry in
your RAS phone book called MY.

RESOLUTION
==========

Put quotation marks around the dial-up entry name; for example:

   RASDIAL "MY ISP"
