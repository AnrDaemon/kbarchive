SYMPTOMS
========

If an application attempts to open the SNA Server Windows APPC and RUI
interfaces from the same process, the application may stop responding (hang) if
WinRUIStartup() is called before WinAPPCStartup().

NOTE: The RUI interface provides access to LU0-3 host applications, while APPC
provides access to partner APPC transaction programs over LU6.2.

RESOLUTION
==========

To workaround the problem, WinAPPCStartup should be called before WinRUIStartup.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server, versions 2.11, 3.0
(all SPs), and 4.0 (all SPs).

We are researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available
