TITLE   :Windows NT Setup Hangs on Disk 3 with BusLogic SCSI Adapters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During Windows NT Setup, when the SCSI floppy disk driver loads from disk 3, the
computer may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if your computer uses the BusLogic BT-946C SCSI host
adapter and SCSI Disconnection is disabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

Enable SCSI Disconnection on the host adapter by changing the Enable
Disconnection value to Yes. You can change the value for individual drives and
should enable SCSI disconnection for all drives.

NOTE: Most SCSI host adapters have SCSI Disconnection enabled by default. This
same difficulty may affect other types of SCSI host adapters if SCSI
Disconnection has been disabled on that device.

Press CTRL+B during startup to access the BusLogic BT-946C SCSI BIOS. For other
types of adapters, refer to the manufacturer's documentation to access the SCSI
BIOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem was duplicated using a BusLogic BT-946C SCSI Host Adapter with
firmware version 4.22 and SCSI BIOS version 4.85-B.
