TITLE   :XCON: Message from PMDF MTA May Be Rejected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT: 4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) may reject a message
forwarded from a PMDF MTA. The non-delivery report (NDR) received by the PMDF's
client may say:

   Maximum time for delivering the message has expired.

CAUSE
=====

Some third-party MTAs assume the date from an embedded message. Some versions of
the PMDF MTA are known to exhibit this behavior. This can create a problem when
sending to messaging systems, such as Microsoft Exchange Server, that do not
allow messages older than seven days. This is not user configurable. The correct
behavior for an MTA when sending embedded messages is to use the creation date
of the host message. This behavior is by product design.

WORKAROUND
==========

To workaround this problem, create a new message rather than forwarding an
existing one.
