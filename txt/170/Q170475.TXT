TITLE   :XADM: No Accelerator Key for the Find Dialog's Help
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Help buttons in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program do not have
accelerator key's assigned to them.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally, the letter "H" on the Help menu is underligned, indicating that you
can press the ALT+H keys on the keyboard simultaneously to select the Help
button. Help buttons in the Administrator program do not have this
functionality. This behavior has existed since Microsoft Exchange Server version
4.0, and is by design.
