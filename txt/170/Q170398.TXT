TITLE   :XADM: Error Applying Service Pack
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Updat.exe program to apply a service pack, the following error
message occurs:

   Could not open the file named C:\setup\bin\Address.dll

CAUSE
=====

The self-extracting executable for the service pack (downloaded from the
Microsoft FTP site), has been expanded without using the -d switch.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the -d option is not used when extracting the service pack files, all the
service pack files are extracted into the current working directory. Most
likely, the extraction process will display messages asking the user whether
certain files need to be overwritten.

If the -d option is used during the service pack expansion, it will automatically
create the required directories and copy files into these directories, and no
files will need to be overwritten. Therefore, to work around the problem, you
need to use the -d option during the service pack expansion.
