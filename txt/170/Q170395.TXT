======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using MS-DOS MTA and Dispatch with Dynadmin results in a failure to connect to a
Netware 4.11 server. The following sample is from External.log:

   03-31-97 13:27 Dynamically connecting T: to FNIO-XDV-
   TAFT\EMAIL:COURIER.DAT.
   03-31-97 13:27 An unknown error code (914:ec) was returned.
   03-31-97 13:27 Reading master file. Could not connect to drive.

CAUSE
=====

The NLSP that ships with NetWare version 4.11 causes Dynadmin to fail. The
Novell utility, NLSP, provides a link state approach to routing and is
automatically enabled during a NetWare 4.11 installation. This link state
routing protocol provides backwards compatibility and, in theory, should operate
successfully in a mixed NLSP and RIP routing environment. Novell Technical
Support has been made aware of this issue.

WORKAROUND
==========

Disable the default NLSP routing on NetWare 4.11 file servers. This is
accomplished through editing the Autoexec.ncf file and running UNLOAD IPXRTR at
the file server console or by selecting RIP in the INETCFG utility. The server
must then be restarted.
