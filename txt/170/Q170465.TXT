TITLE   :WD97: Large MS-DOS File Is Damaged When Opened as MS-DOS Text
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Word, if you open an MS-DOS text file that is larger than 32 kilobytes (KB)
in MS-DOS Text format, the end of the document may contain extended characters
or boxes instead of text.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR- 1).

To work around this problem, open the MS-DOS file in Text Only or "MS-DOS Text
With Layout" format. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. On the General tab, click to select the "Confirm conversion at Open" check
   box, and then click OK.

3. Open the MS-DOS file. A Convert File dialog box is displayed.

4. In the Convert File From list, click Text Only or " MS-DOS Text with Layout,"
   and click OK.

The file is opened and is displayed correctly; however, the layout may be
somewhat different from when the file is opened in MS-DOS Text format.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 SR-1.
