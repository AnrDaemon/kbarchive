SUMMARY

You can use the Windows NT 4.0 Server Tools to administer Windows NT 4.0 servers
from a Windows 95 client computer. The Windows NT Server Tools include Server
Manager, User Manager, and Event Viewer. These tools run only in Windows 95, and
can be used only in conjunction with Windows NT servers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT Server Tools are available on the Windows NT 4.0 Server CD-ROM in
the following folder:

To install the server tools in Windows 95, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

2. Click the Windows Setup tab, and then click Have Disk.
