TITLE   :XADM: Clean Mailbox Utility Deletes Msgs Not Archived
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Clean Mailbox utility in the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program, modified messages are deleted unexpectedly.

CAUSE
=====

Every message has properties that track time properties of the message, such as
the delivery time of a message and the time the message was last modified. The
Clean Mailbox utility in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program
determines the message age on the basis of the MAPI property
PR_MESSAGE_DELIVERY_TIME, that is, the date the message was received. However,
Outlook auto-archive determines message age on the basis of the MAPI property
PR_LAST_MODIFICATION_TIME, that is, the date the message was last modified.

This difference may result in problems. For example, if you plan to auto- archive
messages after they reach a certain age, and you then delete messages using the
Clean Mailbox utility, some messages may be deleted that have not yet been
auto-archived because the last modification date may be changed.

For information about how might the last modification date be changed, please
reference the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
