SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows NT Challenge/Response (NTLM) will fail to permit you access to
a subdirectory if you do not have sufficient permissions to the root of the
drive. However, if basic authentication is used, you can open the web page.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this, use one of the following methods:

 - Grant sufficient permissions for the user in the root of the drive.

 - Upgrade to IIS 4.0, which fixes this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 3.0.
