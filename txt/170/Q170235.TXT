PRODUCT :Word Front Page

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194674.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to restrict end-user access to a FrontPage Web that is hosted
on a Netscape Web server (such as a Netscape Commerce, Enterprise,
Communications or Fast Track server), you may receive the following error
message:

   Server Error: This server does not support restricting end-user access.

If you attempt to create a User Registration page in a root Web on a Netscape
server, an error icon (a red triangle) appears next to the saved page in
FrontPage Explorer, and the following message appears:

   (1) This server does not support registered end-users.

CAUSE
=====

Netscape maintains end-user databases as an optional feature. This behavior
occurs even though you created a database of registered end users, according to
the instructions from Netscape. The FrontPage Registration Form Handler (or
WebBot Registration Component) is not supported on these servers, because
Netscape servers do not support dynamic updating of the database by a Web
browser at browse time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

server, contact Netscape Communications Corporation.
