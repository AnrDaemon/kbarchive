TITLE   :NUMLOCK Causes Logon Problems with Portable Computers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Portable computers have the NUMLOCK key set to on when users try to log on to
the system. This can cause users to type passwords incorrectly, because users
often don't check the keyboard indicators before typing their passwords.

CAUSE
=====

By default NUMLOCK is set to on.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can modify this setting by editing the registry on the portable computer.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

Normally, the computer applies the user settings when the user logs on, but it
uses the default user profile when it is first turned on, before the user has
logged on. To turn this functionality off, the default user settings must be
modified. The Keyboard entry contains user preferences as defined by choosing
the Keyboard icon in Control Panel. Entries are found under this registry path:

   HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Keyboard

   InitialKeyboardIndicators REG_SZ Number
       Default: 0

Specifies initial values for keys. 0 means that NUMLOCK is turned off after the
user logs on; 2 means NUMLOCK is turned on after the user logs on. This value is
set when logging off or during shutdown to preserve the state of the NUMLOCK key
at that time.

This value can also be changed on a user basis by modifying
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Keyboard and the same registry key.
