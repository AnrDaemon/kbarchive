TITLE   :ErrMsg: The Security Information for <path> Is Not Standard...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to view or modify NTFS file or directory security settings, you
may receive one of the following error messages:

   The security information for <path> is not standard and cannot be
   displayed.

-or-

   The security information for <path> is not standard and cannot be
   displayed. Windows NT 3.x and 4.x support certain features such as Deny
   Access Control Entries but cannot edit security information which uses these
   features. The information may have been modified by a computer running
   Windows NT 5.0, which supports these features and can edit information which
   uses them.

   Do you want to overwrite the current security information?

If you say yes and attempt to modify the permissions, the new permissions will
take effect but, later on, the above error messages will reappear if you attempt
to redefine or view the permissions; the original permissions set will be
missing and have to be redefined. This will continue over and over in a cycle.

CAUSE
=====

Either of the above error messages can occur if Quota Manager (or possibly some
other disk quota software) is running on the server and a lock has been placed
on the parent folder. For example, a quota has been set on a parent directory,
such as users, instead of the subdirectories that exist beneath it. When the
quota limit is reached for the parent directory, users, a "lock" will be placed
on this directory by Quota Manager and will affect all subdirectories, therefore
causing the above error messages to appear when attempting to view, set, or
modify NTFS file or directory permissions on the subdirectories.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, remove the lock on the parent folder and, if applicable,
redefine quotas on any subdirectories. After the lock has been removed, the NTFS
file or directory permissions can be set correctly.
