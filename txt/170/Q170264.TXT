TITLE   :Office 97 Programs Do Not Expand Environment Variables
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The paths used in Microsoft Office 97 policy templates (except the Personal
folder) do not accept environment variables. For example, setting the user
template folder in Policy Editor to the following path

   \\<servername>\<sharename>\%username%

generates the following error message when you start an Office 97 program:

   The User Templates folder "\\servername\sharename\%username%" was not found.
   Do you want to create this folder?

CAUSE
=====

When they read paths from the registry, Office 97 programs do not expand
environment variables (such as %USERPROFILE% or %USERNAME%).

RESOLUTION
==========

Use fully qualified path names similar to one of the following:

 - C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates

 - \\<servername>\<sharename>\templates

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 1.00 %userprofile% %username% variable
