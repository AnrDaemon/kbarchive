TITLE   :XCLN: Exchange Client Cannot Change Password Under OS/2 3.x
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Exchange Client on an IBM OS/2 version 3.x platform,
the following error may occur when you try to change the password:

   The NT Domain password could not be changed. A required action was not
   successful due to an unspecified error.

If you press F2, the following message displays:

   MS Exch cli 0 - [8100342B]

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if the OS/2 client is using only the NetBIOS transport. This
behavior is by product design.

WORKAROUND
==========

To initiate the password change to the Windows NT Server, you must have TCP/IP,
SPX, or Named Pipes enabled on the OS/2 client.
