password for the account in User Manager.

WORKAROUND

1. Open User Manager.

2. Select the account being used to logon.

3. Select User and then Properties.

4. Disable the Account Locked Out.

   to Internet Service Manager. Select WWW Service Properties, and type and
   confirm the same password used in User Manager.
