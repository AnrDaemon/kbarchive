SUMMARY
=======

When sending a message with a Read Receipt (RR) request from a third-party
messaging system to Exchange Server, the RR reply may contain the Greenwich Mean
Time (GMT) and not the correct GMT-offset time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Exchange Server processes a Read Receipt request, it sends the RR reply
back with the time stamp in the YYMMDDHHMMSSZ format.

The 'Z' at the end signifies GMT. It is then up to the receiving client or MTA to
add the adjusted offset time to the GMT to allow proper conversion to the local
time-zone.

If they do not adjust the GMT offset, they will simply display the GMT time
stamp.

This may also occur with Message Expiration requests or any other type of request
embedded in the P2 of a message.

Delivery receipt requests usually will not display this behavior because the
Exchange Server MTA encodes the GMT offset into the P1 when sending the report
back.


This behavior is by product design.
