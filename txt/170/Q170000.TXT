TITLE   :SMS: Stop 0E Error on Windows 95 While Running Inventory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Windows 95 system, configured with the Microsoft NetWare
client, executes the Systems Management Server Inventory agent, a Stop 0x0E blue
screen error may occur at approximately 29 percent to 34 percent through the
inventory process. After pressing a key to continue, the blue screen error may
occur again. Once past this part of the process, inventory will continue
normally and complete. Network connectivity is still available. The Smssafe.tmp
file and eventually the Sms.ini file may show that Novell network card Info
failed.

This may appear after applying Systems Management Server Service Pack 2, but has
been exhibited in all revisions of Systems Management Server 1.2.

CAUSE
=====

The DOS inventory component Nwgetnet.exe fails on some systems configurations,
causing the blue screen error to occur. The behavior appears to fail most often
on systems with one or more of the following:

   Pentium Processors
   Xircom CE2 PCMCIA network card driver installed
   Chips and Technologies video driver display

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
