======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When installing Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, or 4.0, the
Setup program creates the following sharenames on Windows NT Server:

   Sharename   Path

   COMCFG      <snaroot>\SYSTEM\CONFIG
   COMLOGS     <snaroot>\SYSTEM
   SNASERV     <snaroot>

Under SNA Server 2.x, only the COMCFG sharename is required by SNA Server. The
SNASERV and COMLOGS sharenames were provided to support back-level emulation
products originally designed to work with the DCA/Microsoft OS/2 Communication
Server product. However, such products have all been updated to work with SNA
Server and no longer make use of these sharenames.

Under SNA Server 3.0, both the COMCFG and COMLOGS sharenames are required by SNA
Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SNA Server uses these sharenames/sharepoints as follows:

COMCFG (<snaroot>\SYSTEM\CONFIG)

   This sharename must exist on SNA Server "primary" and "backup" configuration
   servers and contains the COM.CFG file. The COM.CFG file is where SNA Server
   configuration information is kept for the SNA Server subdomain. This
   sharename is required by SNA Server 2.x and 3.x components to read and
   maintain SNA Server configuration settings.

COMLOGS (<snaroot>\SYSTEM)

   Not used by SNA Server 2.x. Under SNA Server 3.0, SNA Manager uses this
   sharepoint to support remote installation of SNA Server 3.0 link services.

SNASERV (<snaroot>)

   Not used by either SNA Server version 2.11, 3.0, or 4.0 and can be removed if
   needed.
