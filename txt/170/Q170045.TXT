TITLE   :Index Server META Tag Sample Incorrect Shows Close Comment Tag
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT: 1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform property queries based on the META tag in HTML files, and you
set up the HTML file according to the sample Queryhit.htm file, the Index Server
does not return an documents.

CAUSE
=====

The Queryhit.htm sample page (located by default in
wwwroot\samples\search\queryhit.htm) has an error in it that prevents the proper
cataloguing of META tags. The sample page incorrectly shows the closing tag of
an HTML comment as "--!>". The correct closing comment tag for an HTML
document is "-->".

Because the Index Server never sees an end to the comment tag, it ignores all of
the text following the opening of the comment, including the tags. Consequently,
this information is not indexed and will not be returned as a result of a query.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Index Server 2.0 or Windows 2000 Indexing
Service.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the proper close comment tag ( "-->").

STATUS
======

This problem has been corrected in Index Server 2.0 and Windows 2000 Indexing
Service.
