TITLE   :Administrator Cannot Set Logon Banner on ZAK Workstation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Zero Administration Kit for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to set a logon banner on a Windows NT Zero Administration Kit (ZAK)
client workstation by editing the registry after logging in locally as the
domain administrator, the settings are gone at the next logon.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by policies set on the ZAK server. Policy settings
override local Windows NT Workstation registry settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, set the logon banner by configuring the policy file for
the ZAK client workstation. The policy file resides on the ZAK server and can be
modified by using the following steps:

1. Log on to the ZAK server (this is the primary domain controller for the
   network) as the domain administrator.

2. Start Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) and open the Ntconfig.pol file in the
   following folder:

      %SystemRoot%\System32\Repl\Import\Scripts

3. If one does not exist already, create a computer icon for the ZAK client. To
   do so, click Add Computer on the Edit menu, type the computer name of the
   Windows NT ZAK client workstation, and then click OK.

4. Double-click the computer icon for the ZAK workstation, double-click Windows
   NT System, and then double-click Logon. Click the Logon Banner check box to
   select it.

5. Type the text you want to be displayed in the Caption and Text boxes. Click
   OK.

6. Save the file and quit Policy Editor.

You may need to log off and back on to the ZAK client workstation one time before
the policy takes effect.
