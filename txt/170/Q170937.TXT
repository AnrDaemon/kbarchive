PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you install a supplemental converter, you may not see the name of a
supplemental text converter in the Files Of Type drop-down list in the Open
dialog box.

WORKAROUND
==========

In order for Microsoft Word to recognize the new converter, do the following:

1. On the File menu, click Open.

2. In the "Files of type" list, click "All Files (*.*)."

3. Select the file that you are trying to open with the supplemental converter.

4. Click Open.

To save a file in a foreign format that is not listed after you install a
supplemental converter, follow these steps:

1. Open a new blank document.

2. On the File Menu, click Save As.

3. In the "Save as Type" drop-down list, click a foreign file format such as
   Text Only (*.txt).

4. Enter a name for the document and click Save.

5. Close the new document then re-open the document you just closed.

   This re-registers all of the installed text converters including any new
   converters.

6. Open the original file that you want saved in the new file format.

7. On the File menu, click Save As.

   You should now see the foreign format that you want to use in the "Save as
   Type" list.

8. Click to select the file type and then click Save.

======
