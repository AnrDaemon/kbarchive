TITLE   :XFOR: All Mailboxes Replicate After Running Migsmtp.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the Microsoft Mail SMTP Gateway Proxy Migration tool
(Migsmtp.exe), which is included in the BackOffice Resource Kit, you will notice
all mailboxes are being replicated. This occurs because all mailboxes are
modified even if no change has been made to the mailbox.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Mail SMTP Gateway
Proxy Migration Tool of the Microsoft Exchange Resource Kit. This has been fixed
in version 5.0.1457.16 of the Microsoft Mail SMTP Gateway Proxy Migration Tool.
This build of Migsmtp.exe can be obtained by downloading the new MigratNT.exe
from the following location on the Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/exchange/rkintel/rkintel.htm

In this version, use the new -X switch to prevent mailboxes whose proxy addresses
do not change from being modified and then replicated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Migsmtp.exe helps replace a Microsoft Mail SMTP gateway with a Microsoft
Exchange Internet Mail Service by reducing the level of administrator
intervention. It preserves current Internet addresses of the recipients and adds
them as secondary proxies to the Microsoft Exchange Server global address list,
which eliminates the need for the end users to republish their new Internet
address for their business associates.
