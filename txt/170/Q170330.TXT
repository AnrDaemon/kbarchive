SYMPTOMS
========

When you type "hotfix.exe /v" at a command prompt to verify a successful
installation of the Security Fix for Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 2, you
receive the following error message:

   Hotfix Version V1.4 Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
   \\MachineName is Windows NT version 4.0, Build 1381, Service Pack 2

   Hotfix: Error retrieving Installed By.
   Hotfix: Error retrieving Installed On.
   Hotfix: Error retrieving Fix Description.
   Hotfix: Error opening Archive file key File 1.
   The system cannot find the file specified.

   Verifying SecurityFix - Passed

CAUSE
=====

The Security Fix (Secfix_i.exe) is designed to update files only and does not
make modifications to the Windows NT registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Secfix_i.exe file expands automatically and copies files to the Temp folder.
It then applies the fix to the computer. During the reboot after installation,
it removes temporary files used during the installation and does not create the
Hotfix folder in %Systemroot%\Hotfix\Hf000<x> (where <x> is an
incremented number of all the hotfixes applied to the computer to date). The
files are instead copied to the %Systemroot%\ $NtUninstallSecurityFix$ folder.

NOTE: The previous method to install a hotfix differed from this method. The
syntax outlined in the Readme.txt file for verifying a hotfix installation was
to type "hotfix /install" in the folder containing the extracted files.
