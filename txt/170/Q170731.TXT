The Selection.Move method moves the insertion point to the next cell in the
table. The function form of the Selection Move method,

      Selection.Move(Unit:=wdCell, Count:=1)

returns 0 (zero) if there is no next cell in the table. This may be useful for
avoiding the addition of a new row in a table.

This macro posts a message if the current cell is the last cell in the table. The
MsgBox command can be replaced by other commands, depending on the purpose of
the macro.

      Sub IsLastCell()
         If Selection.Information(wdWithInTable) Then
            If Selection.Move(Unit:=wdCell, Count:=1) = 0 Then
               MsgBox "Last cell of table."
            End If
         End If
      End Sub
