The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

After you upgrade to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3, text you enter in an
Msmask32.ocx control displays right aligned. Prior to Service Pack 3, text
displays left aligned.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the OCX passes ES_RIGHT edit style when creating
the edit control window. Service Pack 3 supports right aligned single-line edit
controls, where previously only right-aligned multi-line edit controls were
supported.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Visual Basic 4.0. This problem
was corrected in the latest Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 Service Pack.


MORE INFORMATION
================

There are no properties available for the Msmask32.ocx control to adjust text
alignment.
