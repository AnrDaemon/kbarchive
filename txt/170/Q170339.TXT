picture or object, one of the following may occur:

 - The cropped picture or object reverts to its original size when the document

   -or-

 - When you scroll past the cropped picture, the following error message may be
   displayed:

   The dimensions after cropping are too small or too large

NOTE: If the picture or object was cropped smaller than the original size in
Microsoft Word 7.0, it becomes larger in the Microsoft Word 97 file format. If
the picture or object was cropped larger than the original size in Microsoft

picture or object in Microsoft Word 97 does not correct this problem.

To work around this problem, delete the picture or object from the Word 97
document, reinsert it, and then crop it.
