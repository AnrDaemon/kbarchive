SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Network Monitor with a 3Com 3C59X adapter, Network Monitor
may capture only the data sent to the computer using the adapter. Data sent from
the computer is never displayed in Network Monitor. This occurs with the
El59x.sys network card driver that ships with Windows NT version 4.0 and with
Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 3.

RESOLUTION
==========

Perform the following steps to resolve this problem:

1. Obtain the latest version of El59x.sys from 3Com.

2. Copy the new version of this driver over the previous version in the
   \%SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers folder.

3. Restart your computer.

Please contact 3Com for additional information.


STATUS
======
