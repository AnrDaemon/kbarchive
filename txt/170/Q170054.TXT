TITLE   :XCON: Read Receipt May Not Be Returned From ISOCOR MTA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When a Microsoft Exchange user sends a message with a read receipt request to an
ISOCOR message transfer agent (MTA) user, the ISOCOR MTA may not send back a
read notification report.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Microsoft Exchange user sends the message to an
ISOCOR user with the following X.400 address:

   C=us;A-md;P=prmd;O=organization;S=surname;CN=common-name

When the CN address field is used over a 1984 mode X.400 connection, it is moved
to the Domain Defined Attribute (DDA) field during the downgrade process. If the
message also contains a delivery receipt request, the ISOCOR MTA sends that, but
does not send back a read notification report. This has been found to be a
limitation in the ISOCOR ISOPLEX 800 v.1.15. This behavior is by product design.
