TITLE   :Index Server Cannot Index a Virtual Directory with Require SSL
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT: 1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you select the Require SSL option for a virtual directory, the Index Server
does not index that virtual directory.

CAUSE
=====

Index Server does not index a virtual directory if either the directory is an
exclusive executable directory or you select the Require SSL check box.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to Index Server version 2.0 or later.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use secure https:// links to the virtual directories that you would like
indexed, but do not select the Require SSL check box.

If the first workaround is not acceptable, you can write an ISAPI filter that
redirects all non-secure requests to https:// instead of http://

NOTE: When you install a filter that redirects all non-SSL connections to SSL
connections, it forces all pages on the site to be served securely. As an
alternative, you can include logic in your filter that checks to see if a
specified virtual directory is requested and then redirects to a secure
connection.
