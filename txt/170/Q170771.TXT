TITLE   :Cluster May Fail If IP Address Used from DHCP Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2000,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a server runs Microsoft Cluster Server version 1.0 and the installed network
adapters obtain IP addresses from a DHCP server, the ability to access the
cluster may be compromised.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Cluster Server expects the primary address on configured network cards
to remain available. If a leased address expires and cannot be renewed, network
connectivity may be lost. As a result, failures may occur within the cluster.


RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent IP address failure and other problems, use a static IP address for
network adapters installed in cluster nodes. Static addresses will ensure
availability of critical IP addresses and will further ensure high availability
of important resources.
