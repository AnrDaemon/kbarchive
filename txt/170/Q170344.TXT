PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to view another person's calendar using the Microsoft Exchange
Client or Outlook Client, the following error message occurs:

   Unable to display the folder. The calendar folder could not be found.

CAUSE
=====

This error is a permission problem with the other user's calendar folder.
Permission to view or read another user's folder is optional.

NOTE: By default there are no permissions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. In the Microsoft Exchange or Outlook Client, click the user's Calendar
   folder.

2. Go to the Properties page of this folder either by right-clicking on the
   folder or through the File menu.

3. Choose the Permissions tab to view current permissions. By default you will
   see the name "Default" with a Role of "none." If the role for Default is
   modified, it sets the permissions for everyone with access to a Microsoft
   Exchange or Outlook Client to view the calendar.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This permission problem is the same for all Microsoft Outlook folders, such as
the Inbox, Contacts, Tasks, Journal, and Notes folders.
