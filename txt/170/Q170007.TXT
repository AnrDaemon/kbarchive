TITLE   :XCON: 9224 Sockets Error 10053 Connecting to a Retix 1.41 MTA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:1.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When transferring messages between a Retix 1.41 Message Transfer Agent (MTA) and
the Microsoft Exchange MTA, the following error may be logged in the Windows NT
Event Viewer Application log.

   NMI9224: Internal Operating System Error;
   severity 12 (BASE IL TP4 DRIVER (13) Proc 272)
   10-02-96 01:22:31pm send() call failed on CB 22
   Socket error 10053

Messages will flow between the Exchange and Retix MTAs.

CAUSE
=====

The NMI9224 error indicates that after some sort of timeout condition, the
Microsoft Exchange Server computer tries to initiate an association recovery
over TP4 to the Retix server.

The Retix server drops the connection before the Microsoft Exchange Server
recovery operation is complete. This error is non-critical because when the
connection is dropped, a new association will be created between the two MTAs.

This behavior is by product design.
