 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) client on a computer running
Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you may receive errors stating that
frames did not load or that there was a memory problem.

When you run Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator and use the
Microsoft TCP/IP stack for Windows for Workgroups, you may receive an error when
connecting to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer using the OWA client. The
error for Internet Explorer may state a problem loading frames and the Error for
Netscape Navigator will state that there may be a memory problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Tcputils.ini file, which is usually located in the Lanman.dos directory,
change NUMSOCKETS to a value of at least 10.
