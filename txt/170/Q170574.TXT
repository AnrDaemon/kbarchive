TITLE   :MDG: One Mail Message Floods Windows Mail Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

One message is retrieved repeatedly with the Windows Mail client. The first copy
is marked unread, but all other copies are marked read. The only way to stop the
new message is to log out of Mail. After you log back on, the problem starts
again.

CAUSE
=====

The user's Hex.key file is either locked open or marked read-only.

RESOLUTION
==========

Break the file lock or remove the read-only attribute. The key and mbg files
will need to be reset by using a manual reset or the Mailq16 utility. The MMF
could now be corrupted as well. Rename the current MMF and create a new MMF the
next time you log on to Mail. Then import the old MMF into the new file.
