SUMMARY
=======

This article describes several new tools included with the Zero Administration
Kit (ZAK) for Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Floplock
--------

This tool is used to prevent use of the floppy disk drive (even after rebooting)
using DACL (Discretionary Access Control Lists).

If this service is configured to start up automatically at startup, only
administrators and power users can access the floppy disk drive in Windows NT
Workstation, and only administrators can access the floppy disk drive in Windows
NT Server.

Runapp
------

This tool is used to restart the TaskStation application if it is terminated
unexpectedly.

Con2Prt
-------

This tool provides scriptable functionality to the Add Printer Wizard so that
printers can be added or removed from the command line using a script.

FixPrf
------

Windows Messaging does not automatically use the currently logged on user name
when it is started. The FixPrf tool forces the Windows Messaging client to load
with the user name of the user logging in.

Further information about these tools is available in the Zero Administration Kit
Administrators Guide.
