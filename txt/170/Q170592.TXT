TITLE   :XCLN: Client Appears to Hang When Using Check Names Command
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0; Win95:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows 95, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Check Names command in the Microsoft Exchange client, the
Exchange Client computer may appear to hang. This can occur when you use a
reserved address type for the address name space (such as SMTP, X400, or MS),
the global address list (GAL) is of significant size (for example, thousands of
addresses), and a recipient or distribution list (DL) does not exist with the
same name. Eventually, the operation will fail with the following error:

   The table requested by this operation contains too many names and cannot be
   accessed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. The behavior and subsequent error occur because the
Exchange client is actually attempting to return the entire list of all
addresses available (SMTP, X400, MS, and so on). In a large GAL, this list of
addresses can be in the thousands.
