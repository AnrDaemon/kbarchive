SUMMARY
=======

that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Run Uninstall from LinkAge Setup.

   Prompt).

3. In the Registry Editor, remove the LinkAge entries from the following:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Linkage
