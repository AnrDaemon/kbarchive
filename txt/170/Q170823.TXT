SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the "Call" syntax to invoke a stored procedure when opening a
recordset, an exception might be thrown. Depending upon the version of Visual
C++, whether or not you have DB Tracing enabled and the DBMS in use, you might
see one of the following errors:

   

   Version:        4.X
   Message Box:    <See below for DBMS specific error message>
   Output Window:  <See below for DBMS specific error message>
                State:37000,Native:<DBMS specific>,Origin:[<vendor>]
                  [<driver name/version>][<DBMS--optional>]
                Error: ODBC failure on SQLPrepare->

   

   Version:        2.X
   Message Box:    Internal application error.
   Output Window:  <See below for DBMS specific error message>
                State:37000,Native:<DBMS specific>,Origin:[<vendor>]
                  [<driver name/version>][<DBMS--optional>]
                Error: ODBC failure on SQLPrepare.

   

   Version:        1.5X
   Message Box:    Internal application error.
   Output Window:  <See below for DBMS specific error message>
                State:37000[<vendor>][<driver name/version>]
                [<DBMS--optional>]

DBMS specific error information:

DBMS                 Error String                   Native Code
------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL Server:  Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'EXEC'.     156

Access:      Syntax error in FROM clause.                -3506
(and other
 desktop
 drivers)


NOTE: If you are using Visual C++ 1.5X and connecting to a 16-bit SQL Server
datasource, an exception may not be thrown but the desired result set is not
returned.

CAUSE
=====

While this line of code may appear to be a perfectly valid way to invoke a
stored procedure, there is a small error:

   m_pSet->Open(CRecordset::snapshot, "{ Call szCallTest}");

The space between the "{" and the "C" cause MFC to misinterpret the Call
statement as the name of a table. MFC makes a case insensitive comparison
between any SQL provided in the Open() call and the literal constant szCall,
which is defined as _T("{call "). If the comparison fails, the provided SQL is
incorrectly incorporated into a SELECT statement that is executed instead of the
stored procedure call.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that there are no extra spaces between the first curly brace and the
"Call" key word.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
