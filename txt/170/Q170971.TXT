TITLE   :WD97: Link to Floating Picture Lost When Document Saved as 6.0/9
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbusage word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a Word 97 document in the Word 6.0/95 file format, you may lose
the picture link information when you open the document in an earlier version of
Word.

CAUSE
=====

The converter that saves in Word 6.0/95 format does not preserve the picture
link information for linked floating pictures.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Link the Picture as an Inline Object
----------------------------------------------

When you insert the picture, clear the Float Over Text check box so that Word
inserts the picture as an inline object rather than a floating object.

Method 2: Insert the Picture into a Text Box
--------------------------------------------

To keep the picture as a linked floating object, first insert a text box, and
then insert the picture as a linked inline object in the text box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Word 6.0/95 (via RTF) Export
Converter in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows. This problem was corrected in the
Word 6.0/95 (via RTF) Export Converter that ships with Microsoft Word 97 SR-1.

For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: If your document contains a picture as a linked floating object, none of
following methods will work around this problem:

 - Saving the document in the Microsoft Word 97 file format, and opening the
   document in Word 6.0 or 7.0 using the Microsoft Word 97 Import Converter.

 - Saving the document in Rich Text Format (RTF), and then opening the document
   in an earlier version of Word.

 - Saving the document in the Word 6.0/95 file format using the binary export
   converter, and then opening the document in Word 6.0 or 7.0.
