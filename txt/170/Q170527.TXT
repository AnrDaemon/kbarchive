TITLE   :WD97: Objects Print Incorrectly on Non-Square Resolutions
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbprint word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you insert an inline (non-floating) object into a Word document, the object
may be distorted when printed.

The object may be stretched vertically, squished, or cropped (as though only a
portion of the object is trying to fill the object's allocated area).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the printer is set to a non-square graphics resolution:
that is, with different values for horizontal and vertical resolution, such as
600 X 300 dots per inch (dpi).

This problem has been reported to occur with the following printer drivers, that
print with a non-square resolution:


 - COMPAQ PAGEMARQ 15 v2012.015

 - COMPAQ PAGEMARQ 20 v2012.015

 - Digital DEClaser 5100 v2013

 - Digital DECcolorwriter 1000 17 fonts v2013.113

 - Digital DECcolorwriter 1000 39 fonts v2013.113

 - QMS 860+ Print System

 - Tektronix Phaser 240 17

 - Tektronix Phaser 340 600 dpi

 - HP DeskJet 550C (and other DeskJets)

 - HP Laserjet 4

 - Epson LQ570 (and other dot-matrix printers)

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR- 1).

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Change the Print Resolution
-------------------------------------

To change the printer resolution to a square resolution, such as 300 X 300 dpi,
follow these steps.

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Right-click the icon of the printer you want to use, and then click
   Properties on the shortcut menu.

3. On the Graphics tab, choose a square resolution, such as 300 X 300 dpi.

4. Click OK.

NOTE: Not all printers have settings to change print resolutions, and not all
printers have non-square print resolutions.

Method 2: Convert the Object to a Floating Object
-------------------------------------------------

1. Click the object to select it.

2. On the Format menu, click <Object> (for example Picture).

3. On the Position tab, click to select the Float Over Text check box, and then
   click OK.
