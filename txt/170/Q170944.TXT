TITLE   :WD97: Page Border Art Has a White Background
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbusage kbdta winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Some page borders are displayed with a white background. This behavior occurs
(and may present a problem) if you have the "Blue background, white text" option
selected. (On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the General tab.)

CAUSE
=====

Some border art has a white background, and other art has a transparent
background.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no way to modify or edit the page border art. To change the background
color back to the standard white background with black text, do the following
steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the General tab.

3. Click to clear the "Blue background, white text" check box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The transparency or non-transparency of the border art has to do with the way
the border art was created. Some border art has a white background (in the
actual metafile) instead of a transparent one. Not all of the borders have a
white background. Border art images with non-white backgrounds include the
following:

   Balloons (bunch of balloons not the hot air balloon)
   Pine trees (non stylistic)
   Heart (big red one)
   Sun
   Red cube
   The bio-hazard circle (yellow and black)

To insert page border art, follow these steps:

1. On the Format menu, click Borders and Shading.

2. Click the Page Border tab, and click to select the art you want in the Art
   drop-down list.
