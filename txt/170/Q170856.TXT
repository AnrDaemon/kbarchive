TITLE   :IIS Log File May Be Truncated When Logging to Text File
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you set Internet Information Server (IIS) to log to a text file, and you
select Automatically Open New File Daily, Weekly, or Monthly, the current log
file may still become truncated. As a result, further logging will be directed
to the Inetsvn.log file.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Edit Registry for each service.

2. Set Parameters/LogFileTruncateSize to 0xffffffff.

Method 2
--------

1. Force the registry to write correct value into Parameters/LogFileTruncateSize
   through InetMgr.

2. Change the logging properties by selecting When File Size Reaches option.
   Edit a new size, and click Apply.

3. Go back to original Open New File Daily option. The behavior will now be
   correct.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 3.0.
