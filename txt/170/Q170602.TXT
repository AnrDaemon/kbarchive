The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Zero Administration Kit for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to the Internet using a proxy server on a Zero
Administration Kit (ZAK) client, you may receive the following error message:

   Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site http://<Internet site>.
   The site was not found. Make sure the address is correct, and try again.

CAUSE
=====

The proxy settings for your ZAK client may not be configured correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the proxy settings in the policy file for your ZAK client. The policy
file resides on the ZAK server. To modify the policy file, use the following
steps:

1. Log on to the ZAK server (this is the primary domain controller for the
   network) as the domain administrator.

2. Start Policy Editor (Poledit.exe), and then open the Ntconfig.pol file in the
   following folder:

      %SystemRoot%\System32\Repl\Import\Scripts

3. Double-click the icon for the user group to which the ZAK client user
   belongs. By default, this icon is labeled either AppUsers or TaskUsers.

4. Double-click Windows, and then click the Internet Settings check box to
   select it.

   NOTE: There is a policy listed above this policy that is titled "Set the
   values for your proxy server." Proxy server settings configured in this
   policy have no effect on the ZAK client. You must configure proxy server
   settings for the ZAK client in the Windows policy, as indicated above.


5. Under Settings For Internet Settings, type a value in the Proxy Server box
   using the following format:

   http://<proxy server>:<port>

6. You can also specify addresses for which the proxy server setting should be
   overridden. By default, the proxy server setting is overridden only for
   addresses located on your local area network (or intranet). To add a specific
   address or set of addresses that should override the proxy server setting,
   add a semicolon, and then the address, as in the following example:

   <local>;www.microsoft.com;*.<myserver>.com

7. Click the Proxy Enable check box to select it, and then click OK.

8. Save the file, and then quit Policy Editor.
