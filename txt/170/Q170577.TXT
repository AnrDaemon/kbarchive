TITLE   :MDG: Private Folders in MMF named Orphan Folder #n
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After using the chkmmf (SHIFT+ENTER) or moveuser utilities, a user's mmf file
contains private folders named "orphan folder #n" where n is a number.

CAUSE
=====

The MMF file is already corrupted prior to running the chkmmf or moveuser
utilities. The Orphan folder symptom indicates that the portion of the MMF file
that was corrupted was the index.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the following:

 - Use the Windows Mail client to export the MMF file before using the moveuser
   or chkmmf utilities.

 - Instead of using chkmmf, rename the existing MMF file and import the old MMF
   file into a newly created mail message file. If a backup copy of the MMF is
   not available, there is no recovery from this corruption.
