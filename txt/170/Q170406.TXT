TITLE   :WD97: Allow Fast Saves Option Not Selected by Default
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::Service Release 1 (SR-1)
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, version Service Release 1 (SR-1) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The Allow fast saves option allows Word 97 to save documents quickly by
appending changes to the end of a file on the hard disk instead of rewriting the
entire file during a save operation. Since a Background Save option has been
added to Word 97, the Allow fast saves option is no longer necessary, because
the save operation occurs in the background.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To turn on or off the Allow fast saves option, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the Save tab.

3. Click to select or clear the Allow fast saves check box.

4. Click OK.

The change you make to the Allow fast saves option remains in effect until you
change it again.
