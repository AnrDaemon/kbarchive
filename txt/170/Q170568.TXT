TITLE   :Seagate Tape Drive Light Stays Lit After Exiting NTBACKUP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On Seagate CTT8000-A (ATAPI) tape drives, when you start Ntbackup.exe, the LED
activity indicator light on the tape drive lights up and stays continuously lit,
even after exiting NTBACKUP. The LED will remain lit even if there is no
activity from the drive. The LED will only go out if you eject the tape and
re-insert it. The symptom will show up each time you execute Ntbackup.exe.

CAUSE
=====

When NTBACKUP exits, it issues a REWIND IMMEDIATE, which ATAPI drives do not
support.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
