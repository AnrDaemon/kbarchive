-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you are connected to the Internet through an Internet service provider (ISP),
you may not be able to log in to a Windows NT Domain, or use Microsoft
Networking functionality to connect to another Windows NT-based or Windows
95/98-based computer on the Internet. This may occur even though you may have
been able to in the past.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A number of ISPs have disabled User Datagram Protocol (UDP) ports 137 and 138
and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 139 on their routers to reduce
network traffic and provide protection against out-of-band (OOB) data attacks on
servers. Microsoft Networking components rely on these ports (especially TCP
port 139) for NetBIOS communication.

If you could previously use Microsoft Networking components over the Internet but
no longer can, contact your ISP to determine if UDP ports 137 or 138 or TCP port
139 has been disabled on the ISP's routers.

NOTE: This method of connecting to a Windows NT domain over the Internet is not a
secure configuration and is not recommended by Microsoft. However, you can use
the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) as an alternative method for
communicating with your network over the Internet. PPTP is a networking
technology that supports multiprotocol virtual private networks (VPNs), enabling
remote users to access corporate networks securely across the Internet. Using
PPTP, remote users can use Windows NT Workstation, Windows 95/98, and other
point-to-point protocol (PPP)-enabled computers to dial into a local Internet
service provider to connect securely to their corporate networks using the
Internet.
