IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program you may receive the
following error message:

   Window Title: Microsoft Exchange Administrator Access denied.
   Microsoft Windows NT ID no: 0xc0020005

You also receive this error when you try to run Microsoft Exchange Server Setup.

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs when the Administrator program cannot access the application
event log because the data type is incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To resolve this issue verify that the entries in the registry key exist and the
values are correct. If not, modify the registry key.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following registry key:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog
      \Application\File:REG_EXPAND_SZ:

2. Verify that the registry value exists. Create it if necessary.

3. Verify that it is assigned the REG_EXPAND_SZ data type. Change the data type
   if needed.

4. Verify that the string assigned is the full path to the Appevent.evt file.
   The default value is "%SystemRoot%\System32\Config\AppEvent.Evt" (without the
   quotation marks). Edit the string if necessary.

5. Quit Registry Editor.
