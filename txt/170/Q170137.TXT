SYMPTOMS

When a message arriving from the Internet Mail Service with a date of 1900 or a
2-digit date of 00 is bound for a user on MS Mail connected via the Microsoft
Mail Connector, the PCMTA may stop without error. The message remains in the
PCMTA queue. If you try to restart the PCMTA, you will receive the following
error message:

   Could not start the <msmail connector service name> on <server>.
   Error 1067: The process terminated unexpectedly.

The service will not start until the message is deleted or returned from the
PCMTA queue.
