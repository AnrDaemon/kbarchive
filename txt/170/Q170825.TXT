TITLE   :RAS Auto-Answer Behavior in Windows NT

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the new behavior of Windows NT remote access service (RAS)
when answering incoming calls, in Windows NT version 4.0. This behavior has
changed because Unimodem support is included in Windows NT version 4.0, but not
in version 3.5x.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows NT 3.5x, RAS initializes analog modems by sending an ATS0=1 command
to the modem when RAS loads. This instructs the modem to answer incoming calls
on the first ring. See the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for
more information about this parameter and how to modify the number of rings
before answering:

   Q114687 Setting Number of Rings for RAS Server Auto-Answer in NT 3.5x

By default in Windows NT version 4.0, the modem is initialized by Unimodem, which
sends an ATS0=0 to the modem when RAS loads. When an incoming call is received,
Unimodem answers the call and passes control to RAS. In this case, the "AA"
light on an external modem is NOT lit, though RAS answers incoming calls. For
information about modifying the number of rings for Unimodem to answer a call in
Windows NT 4.0, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q145879 How to Set the Number of Rings for RAS Auto-Answer in NT 4.0

NOTE: Unimodem can be disabled in Windows NT 4.0, which causes RAS to behave as
it does in Windows NT 3.5x, as described above. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q150808 Disabling Support for Unimodem Modems in Remote Access

EXAMPLE
-------

The following is an example of Unimodem initializing or answering the line in
Windows NT 4.0 (from the modem log):
