TITLE   :Err Msg: Query Is Too Expensive
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server versions 1.1, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you issue a query to the Index Server, your browser will return the
following error message:

   Query is too expensive.

CAUSE
=====

If the content index is out of date, and you are executing queries that must be
enumerated, you will get the above error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

Wait until the index is up to date.

Place CiForceUseCi=FALSE in the .idq file for the query. The default value is
TRUE.

You may also need to increase the following values:

hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\contentindex\MaxQueryExecutionTime

hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\contentindex\MaxRestrictionNodes

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: If the query is being executed through ADO and IXSSO, changing
MaxQueryExecutionTime haS no effect, because ADO sets a time-out of 30 seconds
that can not be changed.
