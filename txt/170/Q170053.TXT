PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft PowerPoint Animation Player with Netscape clients,
you may get the following error message:

   Netscape was unable to find a plug-in for
   application/octet-stream.

CAUSE
=====

If you use Netscape Navigator, the Web server must send the PowerPoint Animation
files as a special type of file to avoid the above error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

Ask your server administrator to add the following MIME mapping to the server:

.PPT -> application/mspowerpoint

.PPZ -> application/mspowerpoint

.PPS -> application/mspowerpoint

.POT -> application/mspowerpoint

If you use the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), add the following
registry entries on your server:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\InetInfo\Parameters\MimeMap]
application/vnd.ms-powerpoint,ppt,,5
application/ms-powerpoint,ppz,,5
application/ms-powerpoint,pps,,5
application/ms-powerpoint,pot,,5

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about adding MIME mapping, refer to the documentation for
the particular server being used.
