======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In some cases, the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator may need to delete
all SMTP proxy addresses for all users in the Microsoft Exchange Server site. By
default, SMTP addresses are created for every user based on the Organization,
Site, and Server name.

This article describes the different procedures for deleting SMTP addresses for
all users in Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Exchange 4.0
------------

Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 allows an administrator using the
Administrator program to delete the SMTP addresses for the entire site or
server.

To do this using the Administrator program, perform the following steps:

1. In the Administrator menu, click Site, and then click Configuration.

2. In the Site Addressing properties dialog box, click the Site Addressing tab,
   and then click Remove.

3. When you are prompted for the e-mail address type to delete, enter SMTP and
   click Yes in the Warning dialog box.

NOTE: By doing the above procedure, you remove ALL instances of SMTP proxy
addresses for a user on the site or server. You also disable Site Addressing to
regenerate SMTP addresses for the site or server even though the SMTP option
remains in the Site Addressing properties. This only reflects changes for new
users created after you have selected to delete the addresses.

Exchange 5.0
------------

Exchange 5.0 does not allow the deletion of SMTP addresses on the Site
Configuration level. The only way to remove SMTP addresses is to delete them
manually for each user.

NOTE: It is possible to remove all SMTP addresses without removing the SMTP
attribute for all users by blanking the address instead of deleting. Refer to
the Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q170378, XADM: Blanking SMTP Addresses for
All Users.
