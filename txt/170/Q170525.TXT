SUMMARY
=======

The procedure for printing envelopes from Microsoft Word for Windows to a
Hewlett Packard DeskJet 500 has changed between Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 or
Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0.

In Microsoft Windows NT 3.51, you can load the envelope into the printer before
printing. However, if you do this in Windows NT 4.0, the printer ejects the
envelope without printing. In Windows NT 4.0 the correct procedure is to load
the envelope after sending the print command.
