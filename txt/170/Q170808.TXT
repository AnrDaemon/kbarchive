The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Net View command to view any computer from a multihomed
computer, the following error 52 message is returned:

   A duplicate name detected on the network.

Also, Netstat -n shows the multihomed computer's own computer name in conflict.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be caused by the following WINS configuration:

Each NIC in the multihomed computer points to a different primary WINS server.
Each WINS server thinks it is the owner for that computer's record and is not
registering the client correctly as a multihomed host.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable WINS in one of the NICs, or set up both NICs to point to the same WINS
server.

Additional query words: name conflict duplicate multi-homed
