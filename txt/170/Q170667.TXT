SYMPTOMS

The following error message appears:

   CGI Error

CAUSE
=====

When a search is performed with Microsoft Index Server and the Highlight option
is used (Condensed or Full Text), the link calls Webhits.exe. This is a CGI
application that uses Netapi32.dll. If the IUSR_machinename account (or the
logged on user) does not have access to this file, the error message results.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem does not occur in Index Server version 2.0 and later. To resolve
this problem, upgrade to Index Server 2.0 or later.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Give the IUSR_machinename account or your webusers group read access on
   Netapi32.dll in the Winnt\System32 directory.

   -OR-

 - Do not use the highlighting functionality of Microsoft Index Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Webhits.exe resides by default in the /scripts/samples/search directory.
Netapi32.dll resides in the winnt\system32 directory.
