SYMPTOMS
========

Only the Subject line of a message may print when you print from the Microsoft
Outlook Web Access (OWA) client in Microsoft Internet Explorer.

CAUSE
=====

The OWA client uses frames to separate the header and body of a message. Because
of the way Internet Explorer uses frames, the header of the message will have
the focus by default. Therefore, only the Subject line or the title of the
window containing the message will be printed.

This is a problem with Internet Explorer, not Microsoft Exchange Server or the
OWA client. This problem is corrected in Microsoft Internet Explorer version
4.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

Select any part of the message body before printing the message. You will then
be able to print the entire message.
