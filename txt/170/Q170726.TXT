SUMMARY
=======

When you write macros in Microsoft Word for Windows, it may be necessary to test
for the existence of an AutoText entry before inserting the contents of the
entry. If your macro does not check for the existence of an AutoText entry
before attempting to insert the contents into the document, you may receive the
following error message:

   Run-time error '5941':

   The requested member of the collection does not exist.

Routine to Check for the Existence of a Specified AutoText Entry
----------------------------------------------------------------

If the "Attention:" AutoText entry resides in the Normal template, the following
macro example posts a message indicating that it does exist.

      Sub AutoTextExists()
         Dim atEntry As AutoTextEntry
         ' Look in normal template for
         ' specified autotext entry.
         For Each atEntry In NormalTemplate.AutoTextEntries
            If atEntry.Name = "Attention:" Then
               MsgBox "Entry Exists!"
            End If
         Next atEntry
      End Sub

Routine to Insert Specified AutoText Entry If It Exists
-------------------------------------------------------

If the "Attention:" AutoText entry resides in the Normal template, the following
macro inserts the contents of the AutoText entry in the document at the position
where the insertion point is located.

      Sub InsertAutoTextIfExist()
         'This routine will insert the autotext entry if it exists.
         Dim atEntry As AutoTextEntry
         For Each atEntry In NormalTemplate.AutoTextEntries
            If atEntry.Name = "Attention:" Then
               atEntry.Insert Where:=Selection.Range
            End If
         Next atEntry
      End Sub

Routine to Insert a Specified AutoText Entry from Attached Template
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The following Visual Basic for Applications macro example tests for an existing
AutoText entry named "Attention:" in the active template (the template attached
to the active document):

      Sub InsertAttachedTemplateAutoText()
         ' This routine will insert the autotext entry contained
         ' the active document's attached template if the specified
         ' autotext entry exists.
         Dim atEntry As AutoTextEntry
         For Each atEntry In ActiveDocument.AttachedTemplate.AutoTextEntries
            If atEntry.Name = "Attention:" Then
               atEntry.Insert Where:=Selection.Range
            End If
         Next atEntry
      End Sub
