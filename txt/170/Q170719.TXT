SYMPTOMS
========


When you use the SendKeys function after calling a dialog box, your macro does
not run as expected. For example, the following macro does not run correctly:

      Sub SendKeysExample()
         ChDir "C:\My Documents"           ' Change Directory.
         Dialogs(wdDialogFileOpen).Show    ' Show the FileOpen dialog.
         SendKeys "%A" '                   ' Send the ALT+A keystroke.
      End Sub

CAUSE
=====

Visual Basic for Applications processes code one line at a time. The SendKeys
function sends the specified keys to the active application, just as if they
were typed at the keyboard. If Word is not the active application, and if wait
is set to -1, Word will wait for all the keys to be processed before
proceeding.

Whenever a Word dialog box is opened, it becomes the active foreground
application and it is ready to take commands; it also must be terminated (with
OK or Cancel) before the next line can be processed.

In the example, the SendKeys command should come before the Dialogs command so
that the FileOpen dialog box can process the keys and display the Advanced
search dialog box. Then the next line of code can be processed.

      Sub SendKeysExample()
         ChDir "C:\My Documents"           ' Change Directory.
         SendKeys "%A"                     ' Send the ALT+A keystroke.
         Dialogs(wdDialogFileOpen).Show    ' Show the FileOpen dialog.
      End Sub
