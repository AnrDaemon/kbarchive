TITLE   :DISPLAY or CNOS Calls Fail with UNEXPECTED_DOS_ERROR
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP2,3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When calling the DISPLAY or CNOS functions on Windows NT (over the SNA Server
Windows NT client software), these functions may eventually fail with the
following error:

   primary_rc = 0xF011 (UNEXPECTED_DOS_ERROR) secondary_rc = 593 (internal error
   - maximum routing procs defined)

NOTE: The 593 secondary return code is shown in decimal. This corresponds to a
hexadecimal value of 0x251, or in Intel dword format, 0x51020000.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when an APPC application calls WinAPPCStartup and
WinAPPCCleanup a number of times without being terminated. The APPC library
registers an internal routing procedure for each call to WinAPPCStartup, but
fails to deregister the routing procedure when the application calls
WinAPPCCleanup. This causes the internal routing procedure table to fill,
leading to the above error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11 SP2,
3.0, and 3.0 SP1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version
3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on
