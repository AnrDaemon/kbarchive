SYMPTOMS
========

Text in a document is not discernible from the background even when the text is
selected (highlighted). When the text is selected, you see large blocks of
highlighted text, but you are unable to see the text.

CAUSE

This behavior occurs when the text is formatted with the same color as the page
background color.

page background color. To change the text color, follow these steps:

1. Select the text.

   Word).

   background color.
