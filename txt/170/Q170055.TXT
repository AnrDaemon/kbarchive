SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to view the Microsoft Message Transfer Agent (MTA) Queues in
the Microsoft Exchange Administrator Program, the following error may occur:

   Microsoft Exchange Administrator
   You do not have the permissions required to complete the operation.

CAUSE

To view the MTA Queues in the MTA Properties, an administrator must have at
least the 'Admin' role at the Site level. View-Only Admin does not have
permission to view the MTA Queue.
