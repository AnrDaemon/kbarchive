Exit the User Manager for Domains program. If the problem still persists, check
the task list and remove the Usrmgr.exe task.

In Windows NT 4.0, open the Task Manager by using the CTRL-ALT-Delete key
combination or right-click on the taskbar. Go to the Processes page of the

End Process button.

In Windows NT 3.51, use the Pviewer.exe program in the Windows NT Resource Kit to
kill running processes.

Try rerunning the Exchange installation program.

Note: There may be several User Manager processes left dormant depending on how
many times you have opened and closed User Manager while your server is having
these symptoms.
