======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an application is being accessed by several users in a multi-user
environment, the following error might occur when the database container is
being manipulated:

   Error 1709 - Database object is being used by someone else.

If you issue a RETRY command, it resolves the error message.

CAUSE
=====

Two or more users are momentarily accessing the database container in a way that
will not allow processing the information at the same time even though the
database container is shared. The first user's information is processed and the
second user receives the error. The chances of two or more users triggering this
error is very slim. Therefore, this error occurs randomly. When this error does
occur, the program needs to retry the task for the second user.

RESOLUTION
==========

By setting up an error routine to trap this error and then issuing a RETRY
command you will eliminate this problem. Below is a sample ON ERROR routine.
Place the following code in a prg called onerror.prg:

      PARAMETERS errnum

      DO CASE errnum = 1709
         RETRY
      ENDCASE

At the start on the application, place the following command:

      ON ERROR DO onerror.prg WITH ERROR()


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
