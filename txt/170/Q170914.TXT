TITLE   :WD97: File Open Reverts to Program Folder Not Network Location
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbusage winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set the Documents path in the Options dialog box (on the Tools menu,
click Options), to a Network location on a Banyan Vines or NetWare network, the
Open and Save As dialog boxes may revert to the Word program directory.

NOTE: The Word program directory is the current location of the Winword.exe file.
Mapping a Network Drive Letter or using UNC pathing doesn't seem to change this
behavior.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the Open or Save As dialog boxes to the correct network location before
you open or save your file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
This problem does not occur in Word 2000.
