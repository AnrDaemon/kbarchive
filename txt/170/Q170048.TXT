TITLE   :Err Msg: Cannot Open the File: Queryhits.idq
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WinNT:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click "Show Highlights (full text)" or "Show Highlights (condensed),"
Index Server returns the error message:

   Cannot open the file: \queryhits.idq.

CAUSE
=====

When a web server hosts more than one Web site, Index Server will be able to
function across all web sites with a global \scripts subdirectory, except for
hit highlighting. The CGI program used for hit highlighting, Webhits.exe, cannot
transverse global virtual directories to find the .idq file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to Index Server version 2.0 or later.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Create a second Scripts virtual directory, and point it to the same physical
   directory as the global Scripts directory.

2. Assign the IP address of the virtual server to the new Scripts virtual
   directory.

Because the virtual server now has a Scripts virtual directory assigned to it
with the virtual server's IP address, Webhits.exe will then be able to find the
scripts directory on that virtual server, and return the correct results.
