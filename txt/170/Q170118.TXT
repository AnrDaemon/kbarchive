The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 5.0, 6.0, used with:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to use the Excel 97 ISAM included with DAO 3.5, a DAO 3170 error
occurs with the text "Couldn't find Installable ISAM". When using the MFC DAO
classes with DB Tracing enabled, the error may look something like the following
text:

   

   DAO Call Failed.
   pDAOTableDefs->Append(m_pDAOTableDef)
   In file daocore.cpp on line 2075
   scode = 800A0C62

   Error Code = 3170
   Source = DAO.TableDef

CAUSE
=====

The documentation from the DAO 3.5 SDK that comes with Visual C++ incorrectly
shows the connect string information for Excel 97. The information for the
Connect property shows that the connect string for Excel 97 is "Excel 97". This
is not correct.

RESOLUTION
==========

The correct string is "Excel 8.0".
