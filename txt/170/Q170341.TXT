TITLE   :FIX: LoadPicture Displays 16 x 16 Icons as 32 x 32
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the LoadPicture Function to display a 16 x 16 icon in an Image
control, or any other control that uses the LoadPicture function to store images
into the Picture object, the icon will display at 32 x 32.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.

 - Use a 16 x 16 bitmap instead of an icon.

-or-

 - Use an Image Control and set the Height and Width to be the same as the
   icons. For example:

         Image1.Picture = LoadPicture(<path to your icon>)
         Image1.Stretch = True 'Needed so the image does not get clipped
         'The next two lines assume that the form's ScaleMode is Twips
         'It changes the Image control to be 16 x 16 Pixels
         Image1.Width = (Screen.TwipsPerPixelX * 16)
         Image1.Height = (Screen.TwipsPerPixelY * 16)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LoadPicture always loads a 32 x 32 icon. If the icon file being loaded contains
a single 16 x 16 image, LoadPicture stretches it to 32 x 32 before storing it in
the Picture object of a control.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The steps below illustrate an example that displays a 16 x 16 icon in an Image
control.

NOTE: You can use IMAGEDIT.EXE that ships on the Visual Basic 5.0 CD-ROM to
create icons. This tool is located in the Tools\Imagedit directory on the Visual
Basic 5.0 CD-ROM.

1. Create a new project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place an Image control on Form1.

3. Add the following code to Form1:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
             Image1.Picture = LoadPicture(<Path to your 16 x 16 icon>)
         End Sub

4. Run the form by choosing Start from the Run menu. Note that the icon is
   displayed as a 32 x 32 icon.
