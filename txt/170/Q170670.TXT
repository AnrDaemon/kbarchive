TITLE   :Renaming LU Pools is not a Dynamic Change
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The SNA Server service must be stopped and restarted after renaming an LU pool.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Adding an LU Pool in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 is a dynamic change. This
means that the SNA Server service does not need to be stopped and restarted in
order to take effect. Renaming an existing LU Pool, however, is not a dynamic
change and the SNA Server service must be restarted before the new name will be
recognized. The addition of an LU Pool in SNA Server version 2.10, 2.11, 2.11
SP1, and 2.11 SP2 is not a dynamic change, nor is renaming the LU Pool.
