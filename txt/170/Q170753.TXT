TITLE   :Window Focus Set to Invoke Wrong 16-bit Application Through DDE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user double-clicks a document, based on the association of the document
and the DDE commands specified, the documents will be passed to the proper
application. The current focus will be set to that application as well. This is
the default behavior of Window NT. When the user is running several 16-bit
applications in single memory space, the default behavior stays the same, with
one difference: the current focus is not set to the correct 16-bit application.
This problem only happens when 16-bit applications are run under a single memory
space.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT was not passing the information to the correct application.
