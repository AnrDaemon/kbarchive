IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS

You are able to access network resources from a command prompt; however, when
you try to access network resources from Windows Explorer, you may experience
one or more of the following problems:

 - Double-clicking Network Neighborhood gives the following error:

   Unable to browse the network.
   Network error (1222).

   -or-

 - Clicking Start, clicking Run, typing <computer name>, and clicking OK
   results in the following error:

   \\<computer name>
   The network is not present or not started.

   -or-

 - From File Manager (Winfile.exe), none of the connect drive commands are
   present.

CAUSE
=====

The Multiple Provider Router (Mpr.dll) cannot load any network providers from
the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To resolve this issue, follow this procedure:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following key:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control
      \NetworkProvider\Order

2. On the Edit menu, click Add Value.

3. Enter the following value:

      Value Name: ProviderOrder
      Data Type:  REG_SZ
      Value:      LanmanWorkstation

4. This change should take effect without restarting Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Mpr.dll initializes, it reads the above registry key value. If Mpr.dll
fails to get this information, it will return WN_NO_NETWORK, which produces the
symptoms described above.
