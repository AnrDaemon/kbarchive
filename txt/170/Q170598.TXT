TITLE   :Start Menu Items Missing on ZAK Appstation Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Zero Administration Kit for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the Start menu on a Zero Administration Kit (ZAK) Appstation
client, some Start menu items may be missing.

CAUSE
=====

ZAK Appstation clients obtain Start menu information from the ZAK server. The
behavior described above occurs when any of the following conditions exists:

 - The ZAK Appstation client is unable to connect to the ZAK server.

 - The Start menu information on the ZAK server is damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Log on to the ZAK Appstation client as the local administrator.

2. Attempt to locate the ZAK server on the network by typing the following
   command at a command prompt:

   net view \\<ZAK server name>

3. If the NET VIEW command is not successful, take steps to resolve any basic
   network connectivity problems.

4. When you have established communication between the ZAK server and the ZAK
   Appstation client over the network, check to see if the original Start menu
   problem is resolved.

5. If some items are still missing from the Start menu, verify that the Start
   menu information on the ZAK server has not been changed or damaged. The Start
   menu information is stored on the ZAK server in the following folder:

      <drive>:\netapps\start menu

   This folder contains the .lnk files for the Start menu on ZAK Appstation
   clients.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By design, the following items are not displayed on the Start menu on a ZAK
Appstation client:

 - Find

 - Run

 - Settings

 - Shut Down

If network connectivity is lost, the Programs menu on the Start menu is empty. In
addition, the New Office Document and Open Office Document commands are not
available.
