The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0

For a Microsoft FrontPage 2000 version of this article, see Q196142.

SYMPTOMS
========

In FrontPage Editor, when you insert more than one <Body> tag in the HTML
source, some of the attributes do not take effect when you open the page in a
Web browser.

CAUSE
=====

Although some browsers support this functionality, FrontPage Editor can use only
one <Body> tag at a time. When FrontPage Editor encounters a second
<Body> tag, it replaces the information used in the previous <Body>
tag with the information in the subsequent <Body> tag.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use either of the following methods:

 - Specify all of the attributes you want to use by using a single <Body>
   tag.

   -or-

 - Specify changes to the page elements--such as color, font, background,
   sounds, and so on--by clicking Page Properties on the File menu.
