TITLE   :Multi-session SLI Program Stops Receiving Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an SLI program opens multiple sessions, the application may fail to receive
error notification on all sessions if a link failure occurs, causing the session
to stop responding. This problem was observed in the following scenario:

 - A Win32-based SLI application (running on the SNA Server or a Windows NT
   client) opens 100 sessions, then calls SLI_RECEIVE on each session.

 - A connection failure occurs, causing all 100 sessions to fail. However, the
   SLI application fails to receive any error notification on most of the
   sessions. All SLI_RECEIVEs should return with the following error message
   when the connection fails:

   

      primary_rc   = 0x000F     (LUA_SESSION_FAILURE)
      secondary_rc = 0x08310000 (LUA_LU_COMPONENT_DISCONNECTED)

The above scenario describes the common symptom for this problem. However, the
problem could appear whenever the SLI library receives status or data messages
on a large number of sessions at the same time.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server SLI interface is queuing messages to the RUI interface
incorrectly, which could cause outstanding SLI calls to fail to return to the
SLI application.

STATUS
======

3.0 SP1.
