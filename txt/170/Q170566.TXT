SYMPTOMS
========

Ntbackup.exe in Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 3 adds an additional null
character (0x00) at the beginning of each line in the log when the log is
written to disk using the /l (lowercase "L") switch.

write. The size passed to this function was too big by one byte.

==========
