TITLE   :FP: Authors Cannot Log on to Virtual Servers on Multihomed IIS
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER:windows:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194332.

SYMPTOMS
========

FrontPage authors may not be able to access Webs located within virtual servers
on a multihomed computer running Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)
versions 2.0 and 3.0. For example, a user who has author permissions, or who is
a member of a Windows NT group that has author permissions for a Web, may not be
able to access a Web within a virtual server. In this case, when trying to open
the Web in FrontPage Explorer, access will not be granted if the author uses
his/her own account information, but access will be granted if the author uses
the administrator's account information. This may apply to both root Webs and
subwebs within some or all virtual servers.

CAUSE
=====

The first time you install IIS, a home directory that does not have an IP
address associated with it is created. When you install FrontPage Server
Extensions, the FrontPage Server Administrator identifies this home directory as
"<Default Server>" (without the quotation marks). When you add virtual
servers to the IIS, each one is assigned an IP address using the Directory
Properties page in Internet Service Manager. The FrontPage Server Administrator
identifies each one by it's IP address. If The FrontPage Server Extensions are
installed into <Default Server> and any number of virtual servers, the
Server Extensions may not be able to identify whether a particular user is a
valid author of the Web.


RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the FrontPage Server Extensions from the IIS <Default Server>,
assign a valid IP address to the <Default Server> making it a virtual
server, and then reinstall the FrontPage Server Extensions. To do this, follow
these steps:

1. Start the FrontPage Server Administrator.

2. In the Select Port Number box, select the port that does not have an IP
   address associated with it. The default is 80.

3. Click Uninstall.

4. Start the Internet Service Manager.

5. Double-click WWW Service.

6. Click the Directories tab.

7. In the "WWW Service Properties for <machine name>" dialog box, double-
   click the <Home> directory that does not have a corresponding IP
   address in the Address column.

   NOTE: This is the home directory created when IIS was installed.

8. In the Edit Properties dialog box, click to select the Virtual Server check
   box. In the "Virtual Server IP Address" box, type the valid IP address that
   is bound to the server's network adapter but which has not been assigned to
   another virtual server.

9. Click OK twice.

10. Start or switch to the FrontPage Server Administrator.

11. Click Install.

12. In the Server Type list, select "Microsoft Internet Information Server," and
   then click OK.

13. In the Multihosted Servers dialog box, select the IP address that you
   specified in step 8. If any other IP addresses are selected, click each one
   once to cancel the selection.

14. Click OK twice.

15. When you are prompted to enter the name of the administrator account for
   this Web, type the appropriate information, and then click OK.

16. If Basic Authentication is not enabled, but the FrontPage Server
   Administrator prompts you to enable it, do not enable it. If Basic
   Authentication is enabled, the FrontPage Server Administrator will prompt
   you with a Log On Locally warning. Click OK.

17. Click OK.
