TITLE   :Client Receives Error When Resolving Fully Qualified Domain Name
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempts to resolve fully qualified domain names (FQDN) for your internal domain
fail, resulting in error messages from your applications similar to the
following:

   Host not found

   -or-

   Bad IP Address <host name>.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Proxy Client may cause this problem if it is incorrectly
configured.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the Mspclnt.ini file to add your internal domain suffixes as described in
the Microsoft Proxy Client documentation using the LocalDomains entry.

Using a text editor, open the Mspclnt.ini file and add or edit the LocalDomains
entry in the [Common] section and set it equal to any domain suffixes that exist
on your internal network.

For example:

   [Common]
   LocalDomains = test.lab.com, lab.com

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Proxy Client will, by default, forward all FQDN name queries to
the proxy server on your network. The proxy server then forwards these queries
to its DNS server, which is most likely on the Internet. Unless your internal
domain name(s) are registered on the Internet, the name resolution for the
internal domain name will fail when processed by an external DNS.
