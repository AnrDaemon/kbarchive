TITLE   :SMS: Printed SMS Query Results Do Not Match Screen Results
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbsmsAdmin smsadmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Systems Management Server Administrator program to print a hard
copy of query results, the printed output contains empty lines for some entries.

CAUSE
=====

The last object in the defined Query Result Format is using an attribute that
contains an empty or null value.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, move the Query Result Format object up in the
Format list so that it is no longer the last object queried.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
