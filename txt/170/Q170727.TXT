The following macro copies the file "My Document.Doc" from "C:\My Documents" to
the folder "C:\:Backup"

This example provides an error trap which alerts you when you need to take
corrective steps to complete the operation.

         Sub FileCopyExample()
         Dim sSourcePath As String
         Dim sTargetPath As String

         ' Change these paths to your Source and Target paths.
         sSourcePath = "D:\My Documents\My Document.Doc"
         sTargetPath = "C:\Backup\My Document.Doc"
         On Error Resume Next

         ' Copy the file.
         FileCopy sSourcePath, sTargetPath

         If Err > 0 Then MsgBox Err.Description
      End Sub

NOTE: If you try to use the FileCopy statement on a file that is currently open,
you receive a "Permission Denied" error.

Unlike the Wordbasic CopyFile command, if a file of the same name already exists
in the target directory, Word will not display a message asking if you want to
replace the existing file.

For more information about the FileCopy Statement, from the Visual Basic Editor,
click the Office Assistant, type "FileCopy," click Search, and then click to
view "FileCopy Statement."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
