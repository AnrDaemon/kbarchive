SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, when you open a Microsoft Word version 2.x, 6.x, or 7.x
template that contains menus that were modified by removing menu items, those
menu items may reappear.

For example, when you create a template in Word 7.x and remove the Close command
from the File menu, and then open that template in Word 97, the Close command
reappears on the File menu.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, save your template as a Microsoft Word 97 template,
and then remove the unwanted menu commands from the template.
