======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running programs in Windows 95 that use excessive numbers of TCP
ports (more than 3976 simultaneously), Windows may run out of TCP ports before
the TCP/IP protocol releases closed connections.

CAUSE
=====

The TCP/IP state dictates that when a connection is closed, the connection is
not released until two maximum segment lives (MSLs) have passed. This state is
defined as the TIME-WAIT state. One MSL is defined as 120 seconds, and it takes
four minutes for a closed connection to be released in TCP/IP.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
