The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to share a folder or drive in Windows 95, you may receive the
following error message:

   Sharing: An error occurred while trying to share <share name>. Error
   2116. Shared resource was not created at this time.

You may be able to create the share, but it is inaccessible as a network
resource.

CAUSE
=====

You are attempting to share a drive, or a folder on a drive, created using the
SUBST command.

RESOLUTION
==========

Share the folder from the original drive instead of from the drive created using
the SUBST command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the SUBST command to associate a path with a drive letter. This
creates a "virtual drive" that can be accessed as an additional local drive. For
example, the following sample command creates a virtual drive F that refers to
the C:\MyFolder folder:

   subst f: c:\myfolder

The virtual drive you create using the SUBST command (drive F) cannot be shared
as a network resource. You must share the folder on the local drive
(C:\MyFolder).
