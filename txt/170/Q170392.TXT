TITLE   :PRB: SYS(17) Function Returns Incorrect Processor Type
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbHWMAC kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

WARNING: The information in this article has not been confirmed or tested by
Microsoft. Some or all of the information in this article has been taken from
unconfirmed customer reports. ANY USE BY YOU OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS
ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this information "as is" without
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including but not limited to
the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose.

The SYS(17) function returns the wrong processor type when running on a Power
Computing Power Tower. On this machine, the SYS(17) function reports that the
machine has a 68000 processor instead of 604E processor. Since Visual FoxPro
only installs on Power Macintosh machines, this information is clearly
incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

If it is necessary to determine whether the machine is a Power Macintosh or a
68k Macintosh, use the FXGestalt() function available in FoxTools. The following
code provides an example of how to use this function:

      SET LIBRARY TO Home()+"FoxTools.cfm"
      retval=0
      i=FxGestalt("sysa",@retval)
      ? retval

The variable "retval" returns 1 for a 68k Macintosh and 2 for a Power Macintosh.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Power Computing Power Tower is a Power Macintosh clone that uses the
Motorola chip.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start Visual FoxPro 3.0b on a Power Computing Power Tower.

2. In the Command window, type the following:

         ?SYS(17)

Notice that SYS(17) functions reports that the machine has a 68000 processor.
