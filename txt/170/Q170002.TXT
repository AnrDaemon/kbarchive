TITLE   :XCLN: Exchange Client Cannot Send Attachments on Citrix WinFrame
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running a Microsoft Exchange Client using the Citrix WinFrame interface,
you cannot include attachments in messages that you send.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the Exchange client using the WinFrame interface cannot send attachments,
check the following:

 - Verify the client can send a mail message without an attachment.

 - Check the permissions on the Frmcache.dat file.

   1. Start Windows Explorer. Select the NTFS partition in the left window of
      Explorer.

   2. From the Tools menu, select Find and click Files or Folders.

   3. Type Frmcache.dat in the Named window and click Find Now.

   4. In the file location window, right click on the Frmcache.dat file and
      select Properties.

   5. To verify permissions, make sure that Full Control is selected for the
      group Everyone.

 - Reinstall the client on the Citrix computer. To reinstall the Exchange client
   on Citrix computer:

   1. From the MS-DOS prompt, type Change user / install. This sets the Citrix
      session into the Install mode.

   2. Install the Exchange client (do not start the client).

   3. From the MS-DOS prompt, type Change user / Execute. This sets the Citrix
      session back into the Execute / Run mode. The client should be fully
      functional

   4. Verify permissions on the Frmcache.dat file (see the previous paragraph).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Citrix WinFrame will allow the Microsoft Exchange client to run on the WinFrame
interface. However, this interface only passes video and keystrokes because all
client processing is done at the Winframe server.
