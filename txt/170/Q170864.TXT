SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run any of the Active Data Object (ADO) examples that are
included with the Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) roadmap, you will get the
following error messages:

   Server object error 'ASP 0177:800401f3'

   Server.CreateObject Failed

-and-

   The call to Server.CreateObject failed. The requested object instance cannot
   be created.

CAUSE
=====

You have Microsoft SQL Server installed on this server, and the SQL Server
services are running when you installed Active Server Pages. The ADO Dlls were
not registered due to SQL Server services that were running.

RESOLUTION
==========

Uninstall Active Server Pages by selecting Start, Programs, Microsoft Internet
Server (common), and clicking Active Server Pages Uninstall.

Stop all SQL services from Control Panel, Services.

Install Active Server Pages. The ADO Dlls should be registered correctly.

Test by running some of the ADO samples in the ASP roadmap. They should work.

From Control Panel, Services start all the SQL Server services.
