SUMMARY
=======

The file Vb50.vbp in the Os\Shellnew directory of your Visual Basic CD-ROM is
copied into the Windows\Shellnew directory during Visual Basic installation.
This file is used by Windows to create a copy of this file when you click File
New in Explorer or you click New in a context menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you click New in the File menu of the Windows Explorer or click New in a
context menu, a file list of different application documents or files is
displayed. Choosing one of the items results in creating a copy of that file
type in the specified directory shown in the Windows Explorer or a shortcut on
your desktop.

Windows creates this file by copying the appropriate file in the Windows\Shellnew
directory. When you install Visual Basic, the file Vb50.vbp is copied to the
Windows\Shellnew directory.

When you choose a file from Windows Explorer or from a context menu, Windows only
creates a copy of the file. The file is not launched in the appropriate program.
To launch the file, double-click the file or shortcut.
