TITLE   :TN3270E Printer Can't Connect; LUSessionStateConfused
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade from SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1) to SP2 (or SNA 3.0
or 3.0 SP1), a TN3270E printer emulator may be unable to get a printer session
through the TN3270 server. The TN3270 server reports Event 902 to the Windows NT
application event log, indicating an LUSessionStateConfused error in the
InboundLULUData function.

CAUSE
=====

The TN3270 server is expecting 3270 data by checking for DT_3270_DATA (screen
data) but is ignoring valid DT_SCS_DATA (print data).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11 Service
Pack 2 (SP2) and 3.0 SP1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
