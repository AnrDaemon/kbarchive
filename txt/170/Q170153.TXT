TITLE   :FIX: Excel Automation Samples Cause Errors with Excel 97
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbvfp kbvfp500aFIX

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The OLE automation script in the Olexl.scx example form that creates a chart in
Microsoft Excel fails with Microsoft Excel 97. Several lines of code contain the
incorrect syntax for use with Microsoft Excel 97. Executing the code causes the
following error message to appear:

   OLE error code: 0x80020006:Unknown name.

This OLE automation code is part of the Olexl.scx sample located in the
Samples\Solution\Ole folder.

CAUSE
=====

The syntax for referencing objects in Microsoft Excel 97 has changed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Open the Olexl.scx form and click on the Example 2 command button. In the
properties sheet, open the Click event of the Example 2 object. Locate the
following three lines of code, which are interspersed throughout the code in the
Click event:

      oXLChart1.autoformat(11,1)
      nTotSeries = oXLChart1.SeriesCollection().count
      oXLChart1.SeriesCollection(m.i).delete

Change the lines of code to the following:

      oXLChart1.application.charts[1].autoformat(-4100,1)
      nTotSeries = oXLChart1.application.charts[1].SeriesCollection().count
      oXLChart1.application.charts[1].SeriesCollection(m.i).delete

To help locate these lines of code, open the Click event code, click Edit on the
system menu and select Properties. In the Edit Properties dialog box, check the
Show line/column position check box and click OK. Line numbers now appear in the
status bar. The three lines listed above have the following line numbers: 16,
19, and 21.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Microsoft Visual
FoxPro version 5.0a for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On a machine with both Visual FoxPro 5.0 and Excel 97 installed, run the
   Olexl.scx located in the Samples\Solution\Ole folder.

2. Click the Example 1 button, which runs a cross tab query and populates the
   cells of the Excel spreadsheet.

3. Press the Example 2 button. The OLE automation commands create the Excel bar
   chart. After Excel gains focus and the code stops executing, switch back to
   Visual FoxPro 5.0. The error message appears.
