TITLE   :Invokable TP Timeout May Occur With Non-queued Operation
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to invoke a non-queued Win32 autostarted APPC or CPIC
application configured to run on the SNA Server Windows NT and Windows 95 client
computer, the following error may occur:

   Event ID: 60
   Failed to invoke APPC TP <tpname>, sense data = 084C0000

SNA client-side traces reveal that the application is invoked and correctly posts
a RECEIVE_ALLOCATE (or CMACCP) before the dynamic load request for the TP
arrives, though the RECEIVE_ALLOCATE (or CMACCP) never completes and the above
dynamic load timeout error is logged.

CAUSE
=====

Due to changes implemented within SNA Server 2.11 (and later versions) to
support IBM CICS for Windows NT, invokable APPC TPs which require non- queued
operation may occasionally experience dynamic load timeout problems along with
Event 60.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to the SNA Server 3.0 Windows NT and Windows 95 client is available to
correct this problem (post-SP1). With this update applied, a new registry
setting can be configured to disable this special support for the IBM CICS
product

   CicsSupport: REG_DWORD: 0

where:

   0 = disable support for IBM CICS for Windows NT
   1 = enable support (the default)

If the initial invokable TP is written as a Windows NT service, then the registry
key value to add exists in:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/<tpname>
   /Parameters/ 

If the initial invokable TP is written as a Windows NT application, then the
registry key value to add exists in:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/SnaBase/Tps
   /<tpname>/Parameters/ 

If the initial invokable TP is configured to run on a Windows 95 client, then the
registry key value to add exists in

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/SnaBase/Parameters/TPs
   /<tpname>/Parameters/ 

where <tpname> is the APPC or CPIC transaction program name.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
