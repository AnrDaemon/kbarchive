The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows 1.1

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194443.

SYMPTOMS
========

The FrontPage Editor does not show the correct title in the Title bar.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you import and rename a text (.txt) file by changing
the file extension to .htm in FrontPage Explorer.

RESOLUTION
==========

In FrontPage Editor, type a title in the Title box on the General tab in the
Page Properties dialog box (click Page Properties on the File menu) or in the
Page Title box in the Save As dialog box (click Save As on the File menu).

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create a new page in FrontPage Editor, the page is assigned a default
title based on the template you used to create it. For example, a blank page
based on the normal template will be assigned the following title:

   [Untitled Normal Page].

NOTE: In FrontPage the default title is based on the text you entered on the
first line of the page.
