PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0; :8.01,8.02,8.03,8.04
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.01, 8.02, 8.03, 8.04 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When starting the Microsoft Exchange Client or Microsoft Outlook, the following
message may be displayed:

   Unable to open your default mail folders. You do not have permission to log
   on.

   [OK]

Outlook will also display the following message:

   Would you like to open your default File System folder instead?

   [Yes] [No]

Clicking OK in the Exchange Client or OK and No in Outlook will return you to the
desktop. Clicking OK and Yes in Outlook will open empty system mail folders.

CAUSE
=====

The logon credentials of the Exchange Client or Outlook are different from the
logon credentials of the user logged into the workstation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Log off of the workstation and log back on with the same user credentials as the
Exchange Client or Outlook.

-OR-

1. Remove Named Pipes from the Exchange binding order. See the following
   Knowledge Base article for more information on this topic.

   -AND-

2. After removing Named Pipes from the Exchange binding order, from Control
   Panel, double-click Mail. On the Services tab, click Show Profiles, then
   click Properties for the profile, then Properties for Exchange Server
   service. On the Advanced tab, clear the Use Network Security during Logon
   option. This will prevent the Exchange Client from using the cached
   credentials used to log into the workstation initially.

NOTE: If Named Pipes is listed in the Exchange Client binding order as the
primary protocol, the logon credentials will be used regardless of the Use
Network Security setting. This is documented in the following Knowledge Base
article:
