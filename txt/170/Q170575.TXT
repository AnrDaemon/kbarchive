-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Windows Client, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Mail Client for Windows installed under Windows 95 does not have a
Spell Check Option on the Edit drop down menu. Clicking About on the Help menu,
shows the Microsoft Mail version to be "Microsoft Mail for Windows 95."

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the MS Mail client for Windows Setup.exe is started
either from a Start, Run, drivesUNC statement or through Network Neighborhood.
The installation will indicate the setup was successful; however, the Msmail.exe
will not be updated to indicate this is a full version of the mail client and
not the workgroups version.

WORKAROUND
==========

A mapped drive is required for a successful setup of MS Mail client for Windows.
Rerun Setup.exe from a mapped drive.
