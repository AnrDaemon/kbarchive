SUMMARY
=======

Internet Information Server (IIS) can be installed automatically in unattended
setup mode as part of a Windows NT 4.0 unattended install or as a standalone
unattended install.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For an unattended install of IIS without using Windows NT unattended install
(standalone).

1. Create a blank UNATTEND.TXT file that will be referenced by the install. The
   Setup program must access this file during setup, so place it on a drive that
   will be accessible.

2. Add the following sections (in this order) to the blank file and save it.
   Edit the file as needed to meet your configuration requirements. See the
   white paper referenced below for detailed information on these settings.

         ;Begin File

         [Network]
         InstallInternetServer = IISSettings

         ;*Note, InstallInternetServer is referring to the section name of the
         ;unattend.txt file that contains the installation options you define.
         ;The section name can be changed.

         ;The next section contains the IIS installation options

         [IISSettings]
         ; the following settings default to 1, a value of 0 makes the setting
         FALSE.
         InstallINETSTP=0 | 1
         InstallADMIN=0 | 1
         InstallWWW=0 | 1
         InstallW3SAMP=0 | 1
         InstallHTMLA=0 | 1
         InstallFTP=0 | 1
         InstallGOPHER= 0 | 1
         InstallODBC=0 | 1

         ; default to %WinDir%\system32\inetsrv
         InstallDir=

         ; default to %SystemDrive%\INetPub\wwwroot
         WWWRoot=
         ; default to %SystemDrive%\INetPub\gophroot
         GopherRoot=
         ; default to %SystemDrive%\INetPub\ftproot
         FTPRoot=

         ; default to IUSR_MachineName
         GuestAccountName=IUSR_Account
         ; default to a random-generated value
         GuestAccountPassword=aaabbbccc

         ;End of file
    

3. Use the Inetstp.EXE program to execute IIS setup. This file can be found in
   the i386\Inetsrv directory on the Windows NT 4.0 CD. The following parameters
   are required to execute the unattended install:

   INETSTP.EXE /N /B <full path of unattend.txt> /Z <IISSectionName>

NOTE: in the example above, the IISSectionName is "IISSettings." If this
parameter or any of the others is omitted, the unattended install will fail.

For an unattended installation of Windows NT 4.0 and IIS 2.0:

Please see "Microsoft Windows NT Workstation Deployment Guide" white paper for
more information on automating the NT Server, NT Workstation and IIS setup
process. This paper can be found at:

NOTE: You can set up Windows NT unattended without installing any part of IIS:

 - Add the following to the network section of the Windows NT Unattend.txt
   file:

         [Network]
         DoNotInstallInternetServer = ""
