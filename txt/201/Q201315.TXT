TITLE   :XFOR: Propagation of Lotus Notes Group to Exchange Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Lotus Notes Group entry is propagated to an Exchange Server distribution
list (DL) by means of directory synchronization, the created Exchange Server DL
does not have an alias.

CAUSE
=====

The default mapping from Notes to Exchange Server for the alias is:

   Alias = ShortName

However, the Notes Group does not have a ShortName field, so there will be no
alias for that alias entry in Exchange Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft recognizes the need for correcting this mapping anomaly. We have
modified Exchange Server 5.5 so that this problem of mapping has now been
corrected. To obtain this feature, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange
Server 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

This feature was first included in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.
