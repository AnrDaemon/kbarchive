TITLE   :XFOR: Information Store Archiving a Message If ResolveP2 Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Inbound Internet mail from a custom recipient may not be delivered if the
following registry key is enabled:

   HKLM/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/MSExchangeIMC/Parameters/ResolveP2

The incoming message is archived on an Internet Mail Service server and the
following events are logged:

   Event ID: 12004
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Description:
   Error 80004005-F0000000 occurred while processing message <>. The
   archive filename is '3SW32JRP'.

   Event ID: 4117
   Source: MSExchangeIMC
   Description:
   An error was returned from the messaging software the Internet Mail Service
   uses to process messages on the Microsoft Exchange Server. As a result, the
   message in spool file 3SW32JRP failed to be delivered. The message has been
   moved to the IMCDATA\IN\ARCHIVE directory.

NOTE: The file name is different in each scenario and for each mail message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if two sites have identical custom recipients, and
directory replication between them creates duplicate entries in the global
address list. For example, if someone@microsoft.com exists in site X and
someone@microsoft.com exists in site Y, after site replication occurs between
them, the global address list contains two identical entries for "someone,"
which results in ambiguous names.

The Internet Mail Service submits the message to the information store, which
looks up the Directory service and finds an ambiguous name returned error. This
error is mapped as E_FAIL, the error messages in the "Symptoms" section of this
article is logged, and the message is archived.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
