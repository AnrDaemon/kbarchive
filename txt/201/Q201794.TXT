TITLE   :BUG: Allowing Port Range Selection for Default System Protocols
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbole kbDCOM kbInternet kbGrpDSCom kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Distributed Component Object Model Configuration utility (DCOMCNFG.exe)
allows port range selection for application IDs (AppIDs), even if you do not
select a protocol. If you do not configure a protocol at the Application level,
DCOMCNFG lists Default system protocols on the Endpoint tab for the specific
application. When you click Default system protocols, a Property dialog box
appears, in which you can configure endpoint information for the default system
protocols. DCOMCNFG should only display the Property dialog box for specific
protocols configured at the Application level.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run DCOMCNFG.

2. Double-click an application.

3. Click the Endpoint tab. Note that the Properties button is unavailable.

4. On the Endpoint tab, click Default system protocols. Notice that the Property
   dialog box appears, even though it should not.

Even though DCOMCNFG allows you to change the port ranges for the default system
protocols in the Property dialog box, DCOMCNFG does not update the information
in the registry.
