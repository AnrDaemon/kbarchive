PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running a Crystal Info for SMS report from the Systems Management Server
Administrator Console, the report fails to run, and you receive the following
error message:

   Cannot open SQL server

CAUSE
=====

The user account being used to run the report does not have appropriate NTFS
access permissions to the folder in which the report is stored.

WORKAROUND
==========

Either grant appropriate access permissions to the account being used to run the
report, or use an account with the appropriate permissions. The user account
that is used to create and run reports needs to have at least read, write, and
execute permissions on the CINFO folder and subfolders.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
