The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

For a site server to have the ability to install a client access point (CAP) to
a NetWare Directory Services (NDS) volume, the site server must have the
Intranetware 4.30.410 or later redirector installed with Internetwork Packet
Exchange (IPX). TCP/IP only configurations are not valid.

It does not matter if the redirector was not installed when SMS was originally
installed on the site server. However, the redirector must be installed PRIOR to
adding any NDS functionality in the Administrator User Interface (UI).

Step-by-Step Example

1. There must be an account in the NDS tree that has Supervisor rights to the
   volume that will house the CAP and Logon Point.

   SiteCode of the site to add an NDS volume to Site Settings, Connection
   Accounts, Site System. Right-click Site system and then select New Netware
   NDS. When the window opens, click Set, then supply the tree and the FULL path
   of the user object as illustrated by this example:

   .smsadmin.sms.ncsms.microsoft

   For example:

    .user.container.parentcontainer.organization

3. In the SMS Administrator UI, expand Site Database, Site Hierarchy, SiteCode
   of the site. To add a NDS volume to Site Settings, Site System, right-click
   Site system and then choose NEW - Netware NDS VOLUME. Provide the Tree name
   and FULL path of the volume object. For example:

   .volume.container.parentcontainer.ogranization

   as illustrated by this example:
