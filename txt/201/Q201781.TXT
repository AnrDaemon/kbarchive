-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Systems Management Server tries to discover devices through network
discovery by querying the DHCP server, it is able to find devices with dynamic
IP addresses, but not those with static addresses.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If static IP addresses are used in your environment, there are two ways to
discover these devices:

 - Use network discovery and leave the computer on the network constantly. As a
   result, it should appear in the NetToMediaTable of its local router. When the
   router is detected, it will be added to SNMP devices and the computer with
   the static address will be discovered.

 - Use domain discovery in the computer's domain. Domain discovery will
   enumerate the client machines through the domain master browser and will
   discover machines regardless of how they receive their IP address.
