TITLE   :SMS: NetWare Users Do Not Have Rights to the SMSLOGON Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbBindery kbOSNovell

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A NetWare user that is logging onto a NetWare 4.x server using bindery emulation and does not have the security equivalence of administrator, may not have rights to the SMSLOGON directory on the NetWare Client Access Point.

By default, the NetWare Everyone group has access to the SMSLOGON directory. The Everyone group is not created by default in bindery context on a NetWare 4.x server.

In order for users to successfully run the Smsls.scr from the logon script, the Everyone group must be created in the bindery context (the user is a member of the Everyone group automatically if the Everyone group exists).


SUMMARY
=======

If after logging onto the server you attempt to view the available folders on
the NetWare server you will find that SMSLOGON is not one of them. This folder
is only available if you have administrator security equivalence. This is a
known issue.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Please refer to the Novell NetWare documentation for information on how to
create user groups.
