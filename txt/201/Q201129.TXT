   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use Windows NT Explorer to delete a folder on a shared resource,
you may be unable to delete the folder if its name does not comply with the
MS-DOS 8.3 naming convention. This includes file names that contain spaces or
are longer than eight characters plus a three-character file extension.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you configure the NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation
value in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem

You can also configure this setting through System Policies under "Default
Computer\Windows NT System\File system\Do not create 8.3 file names for long
file names."

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this problem:

1. Start Regedt32.exe and locate the
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem key.

2. Double-click the NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation value.

3. Type "0" (without the quotation marks) in the Data box.

4. Click OK, and then quit Regedt32.exe.

5. Quit Windows NT, and then turn off your computer.

6. Turn on your computer, and then restart Windows NT.

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods:

 - Use Windows NT Explorer to delete the folder locally on the server on which
   it resides.

 - Use File Manager to delete the folder remotely or locally.

 - Type a command at the command prompt to delete the folder remotely or
   locally.
