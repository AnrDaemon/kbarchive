SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the steps necessary for you to insert a Java Applet into
a HTML document in FrontPage Editor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On the Insert menu in FrontPage Editor, point to Other Components, and then
click Java Applet.

On the Insert menu, point to Advanced, and then click Java Applet.

1. In the Applet Source box of the Java Applet Properties dialog box, type in
   the name of the Java applet source file. Java applet source files usually
   have a .class file name extension.

   NOTE: You will need to import the Java applet class file(s) into your
   FrontPage web.

1. If the HTML document is in a different location than the Java Applet Class
   file(s), you will need to type the URL of the folder that contains the Java
   applet class file(s) into the Applet Base URL box.

2. In the Message For Browsers Without Java Support box, you can type in a HTML
   tag for Web browsers that do not support Java applets.

3. For each parameter that you need to pass to the Java applet, click Add, and
   type the parameter's name and the value needed in the Set Attribute Value
   dialog box.

4. Because there is no standard mechanism for displaying the valid properties
   and values for a given applet, you will need to consult the documentation for
   the Java applet and input the correct parameters and values.

5. In the Layout section of the Java Applet Properties dialog box, you can
   optionally specify alignment, width and height values, horizontal and
   vertical spacing, and border thickness for the Java applet.

6. Click OK to close the Java Applet Properties dialog box.
