PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Windows 98 client using multiple monitors, the administrator is unable to
move the mouse to the 2nd monitor, and if the user moves it from monitor #1 to
monitor #2, the administrator can no longer see the cursor in the viewer window.

CAUSE
=====

Multiple monitors on Windows 98 are not supported at this time so you will only
get the "master monitor" from within remote control.

WORKAROUND
==========

Manually discontinue use of multiple monitors on Windows98 clients during use of
SMS 2.0 remote tools.

STATUS
======

This is a known issue. Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems
Management Server version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

See the SMS 2.0 release notes rc32.
