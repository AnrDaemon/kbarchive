SYMPTOMS
========

When an Active Server Pages (ASP) application runs, you may receive the
following error(s).

Application Event Log Error:

   Failed on creation from object context: CoCreateInstance (ProgId:
   ADODB.Connection.1.5) (CLSID: {00000514-0000-0010-8000-00AA006D2EA4})
   (Microsoft Transaction Server Internals Information: File:
   d:\viper\src\runtime\context\ccontext.cpp, Line: 1292)

Browser error:

   Microsoft VBScript runtime error '800a01ad' ActiveX component can't create
   object /test.asp, line 1

The line in the Active Server Pages file reads as follows:

   <% set db = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection") %>

CAUSE
=====

This problem is related to the permissions granted to your DLLs. The
IUSR_computer and IWAM_computer account (where computer is the name of the
machine) do not have the permissions necessary to execute the DLLs being
instantiated on the "Server.CreateObject" line in the ASP code.

RESOLUTION
==========

The IUSR_computer and IWAM_computer account must be granted read permissions to
the <drive letter>:\Program Files\Common Files\System\ADO directory.
