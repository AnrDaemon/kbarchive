TITLE   :XADM: CRs and DLs Are Not Moved But Are Mapped in Logs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you start the Move Server wizard and choose not to move custom recipients and
distribution lists, the log files indicate that the custom recipients and
distribution lists are mapped. The entry is logged in the log files
(Movesrvr.log in the Mvsrvdat directory) as follows:

   3:01:13 PM 8/26/98 - Map Remote Recipients
   3:01:13 PM 8/26/98 - Map Distribution Lists
   3:02:25 PM 8/26/98 - Map Configuration Information

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The mapping pass always includes the export of distribution list objects. If you
choose not to move distribution lists, the only processing performed on
distribution list objects during the mapping pass is a check of whether the
owner of the distribution list objects is moving. If the owner is moving, a
warning is included in the Report.txt file.

If you select the Don't Move Custom Recipients option, custom recipient mapping
is skipped properly.
