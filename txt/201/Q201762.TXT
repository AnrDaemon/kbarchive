TITLE   :SMS: Software Metering Clients Receive Error in liccli.log
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Software Metering is set up on the site but the clients are not responding to
license limitations and show an error in their liccli.log:

   "ERROR: Registry key missing or corrupt."

MORE INFORMATION
================

In setting up Software Metering on a site with no server defined as a site
software metering server, the error above will appear in the client's liccli.log
if the Software Metering agent is installed on a client. This occurs because
Software Metering will not install a value for a registry key indicating the
License servers in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Sites\<site
code>\Client Components\License Metering, and will also be missing its
necessary sub-key.

To resolve this problem:

1. Go into the SMS Administrator console.

2. Right-click on SMS\Site Database<site name>\Site Hierarchy\<site
   name>\Site Settings\Site Systems\<site Server\

3. Go to Software Metering Server.

4. Check the box that reads "Use this site system as a software metering
   server."
