======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When compiling an ActiveX component, you might see the following error message:

   Unexpected error occurred in code generator or linker. --View error messages?

If you click Yes, messages similar to the following might appear:

   <project name>.OBJ : warning LNK4104: export of
   symbol"DllUnregisterServer" should be PRIVATE
   <project name>.OBJ : warning LNK4104: export of symbol
   "DllGetClassObject" should be PRIVATE
   <project name>.OBJ : warning LNK4104: export of symbol
   "DllRegisterServer" should be PRIVATE
   <project name>.OBJ : warning LNK4104: export of symbol "DllCanUnloadNow"
   should be PRIVATE
   Creating library <path to .lib file> and object <path to .exp
   file>
   LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file "<path to .lib file>"
   LINK : fatal error LNK1141: failure during build of exports file

NOTE: These warnings might vary or not appear at all.

CAUSE
=====

The <project name>.exp and/or <project name>.lib files in the
project directory are read-only.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the read-only attribute to read/write.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Export file (.exp) and Import Library file (.lib) are created in a Visual
Basic project directory when, for example, you compile a component project.
These files are actually Visual C++ files. Their purpose is explained in greater
detail in Visual C++ Help files.

One typical scenario in which these files might unexpectedly become read-only is
if they are manually added to source control through the Visual SourceSafe
Explorer. Unchecked out files in Visual SourceSafe are marked read-only.
Microsoft recommends that you not place these types of files under source
control. And, if you have such files currently under source control, you should
remove them.

NOTE: This problem is not specific to Visual SourceSafe. Simply changing the
file's attribute manually, or by any other process, to read-only would be
sufficient to reproduce this behavior.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an ActiveX DLL project and save it.

2. Compile the project. (This step creates the .lib and .exp files.)

3. Next, from project's compile directory in Windows Explorer, right-click
   either the .lib or .exp file and select Properties to change the file's
   attribute to read-only.

4. Compile the project again to the same directory as used in Step 2.
