SUMMARY
=======

To install a Systems Management Server 2.0 client, do the following:

1. Run Smsman.exe for a Novell Directory Services (NDS) client and use the /C
   switch.

2. When the "Welcome to Systems Management Installation Wizard" dialog box
   appears, click Next to continue. You will then see a screen with Specify
   Installation Location selected. (The Automatically Select Installation
   Location (recommended)\ option is read-only and is not available.)

3. Type the directory path to the NDS volume that contains the Smslogon
   directory. The proper syntax is:

   \\treename\.volumename.ou.o

   such as:

   \\microsoft\.sms.ncsms.mssms

   where tree = microsoft, volume = sms, ou = ncsms, and o = mssms

Additional query words: prodsms netware client install cli32nw
