The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Exchange Server and MAPI do not support several rich text items handled by Lotus
Notes. This results in unexpected behavior when synchronizing messages between
Exchange Server public folders and Lotus Notes discussion databases using the
Microsoft Notes Application Connector.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Rich text items handled by Lotus Notes which may cause problems include:

 - Page breaks

 - Buttons

 - Hotspot popup text

 - Table gridlines

 - Keyword radio buttons

 - Keyword check boxes

 - Margins

 - Line spacing

 - Certain tab and justification settings

These items are not included in the message structure when converted to Exchange
Server.
