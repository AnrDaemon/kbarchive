TITLE   :XFOR: After Notes Migration, Calendar Entries Cannot Be Modified
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Lotus Notes meeting owners who are migrated to Microsoft Exchange Server can no
longer modify the Attendee invitation list for meetings sent before the
migration.

CAUSE
=====

The Notes Migration wizard incorrectly sets the Appointment Owner attribute for
these migrated meetings.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange Server
5.5 Migration wizard. This problem was first corrected in Microsoft Exchange
Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a meeting owner is the same as the calendar owner, the Notes Migration wizard
does not set the meeting owner properties. Outlook and Schedule+ assume by
default that the calendar owner is the meeting owner. This allows all meetings
to be modified by the user after the migration from Lotus Notes.
