SUMMARY
=======

In Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0, collections are used to group resources
in a way that is logical for software distribution, reports, and many other
administrative tasks. If you navigate under Site Database|Collections in SMS
Administrator, right-click on the desired collection and click refresh or press
the F5 key, new machines may not show up. However, if you right-click on the
desired collection and select "Update Collection Membership," new machines
appear.

The Collection Evaluator thread of the SMS_EXECUTIVE updates collection
memberships once an hour by default. Clicking refresh or hitting the F5 key
simply reads what the collection evaluator gathered in its last cycle; selecting
Update Collection Membership forces SMS to reevaluate the resources in the
site.

You can change the interval at which collections are updated by right-clicking on
the desired collection, and selecting the Membership Rules Tab of Collection
properties. Then click Schedule and specify when and how often you want to
update the collection membership.

Additional query words: prodsms collections update
