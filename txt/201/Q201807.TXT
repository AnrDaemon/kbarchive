SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Systems Management Server has a utility that allows you to send Event
to Trap configuration data as a package to all of your Microsoft Windows NT
clients within a site. The utility, EventCmi (or EventCma for Systems Management
Server 1.2, or EventCmt for Systems Management Server 2.0) can save you time and
effort when configuring clients and servers to report Event data as Traps.

This utility can be found in the following locations, depending upon your
platform:

In the Systems Management Server 1.2 CD in the Smssetup\Common\Intl directory:

 - EventCma.exe (for Alpha platforms)

 - EventCmi.exe (for I386)

In the Systems Management Server 2.0 CD in the
Smssetup\Scripts\00000409\Eventcmt\<platform> directory:

 - EventCmt.exe

To distribute Event to Trap configuration data, follow these steps:

1. Within the Event to Trap Translator, select the configured Events.

2. Click "Save as", to create an Event Configuration file.

3. Create a package to distribute this data to your clients and servers. The
   source of the package is the EventCmi executable file and the Event
   Configuration file.

4. Execute the following command line to run this package, where x refers to the
   version of the utility you are using:

   EventCmx Event.cfg

   NOTE: x applies to the version of the utility you are using.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can verify that the data is written to the client by checking the
configuration data in its registry location:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Snmp_Events/Eventlog/Sources
