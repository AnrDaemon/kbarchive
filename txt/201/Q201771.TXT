The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to set up an FTP site so that when users log on with
their user name and password, they are logged onto their respective subfolders
by default. Although they can navigate to the root folder, they cannot see the
contents of the other users folders.

When anonymous users view the FTP site, they can only view the contents of the
root folder. Although they will see the names of the users' subfolders, however,
they cannot examine their contents.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up the FTP site, perform the following:

1. In User Manager, create a user account for each of your users.

   NOTE: These users need to have the local log on permission. By default, new
   users belong to the built-in Users group, which has local log on permission.

2. Using the Windows NT Explorer, on a partition formatted with NTFS, give the
   FTP site's root folder the following security access types:

    - Administrators: Full Control
    - Everyone: Read
    - System: Read

3. Create a subfolder for each user. (These subfolders will inherit the root
   folder's security settings). Make the following security changes:

    - Remove the Everyone group.
    - Change the System account's folder's access to Full Control (instead of
      Read).
    - Add the user who will use that folder, and give that user Full Control
      access.
