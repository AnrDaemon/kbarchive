TITLE   :Remote MMC Does Not Display All IP Addresses
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the MMC from a remote computer, the new Web site wizard does not
enumerate all of the IP addresses of the destination server (it returns "Any
Unassigned" and the IP of the destination computer only). If you run the wizard
locally, all IP addresses are shown.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. You cannot query the IP addresses of a remote computer using
the MMC interface. This information is simply not provided by the operating
system. A remote registry query enumerates the static IP addresses, but not the
dynamic IP addresses. There are also firewall concerns involved that prevent
this from functioning properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 4.0.
