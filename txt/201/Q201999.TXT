TITLE   :SMS: ANSI SQL-92 Keywords Used as SMS Database Column Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2,2.0,6.0,6.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase smsdatabase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server, some ANSI SQL-92 keywords are also column names in
the SMS database. This was first discovered when using SQL Server version 6.0 as
the database for Systems Management Server 1.2.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2 and 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are some of the ANSI keywords that are also column names in the
SMS database:

   ACTION
   EXPIREDATE
   SIZE
   DATE
   TIME
   TIMESTAMP
   VALUE

The Chkup65.exe utility still reports reserved words for column names; among them
are DOMAIN, ACTION, TIME, and SIZE. However, none of these are on the Microsoft
SQL Server 7.0 current list of reserved words, and there is no corresponding
upgrade-checking program for SQL Server 7.0 that reports any others. Upgrade and
installation has not reported any keyword conflicts with Systems Management
Server 2.0 running on SQL Server 7.0.
