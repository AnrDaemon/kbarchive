TITLE   :All Exchange Users Receive NDR When Sending to cc:Mail Users
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Server users may get a non-delivery report (NDR) when sending
messages to cc:Mail users although CC:Mail users are able to send messages to
Exchange Server users. This may happen even when the Custom Recipient container
of cc:Mail users is populated and the cc:Mail names are showing up in the Global
Address list (GAL). The NDR is immediate and includes the following
information:

Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   Subject: <subject> Sent: <date / time>

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

   <Recipient> on <date / Time> The recipient name is not recognized
   MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:<Site>:<Server name>

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Verify that the address being used is accurate.

2. Verify that cc:Mail traffic is allowed to the cc:Mail connector.

3. Verify the address type in the cc:Mail address space property page. It is
   recommended that an * or a blank address is defined. The * will be a wild
   card and the space being a least character match.

4. If a more exact address type needs to be defined, confirm the use of * or
   blank space first to ensure mail flow and then verify the use of an accurate
   post office name.
