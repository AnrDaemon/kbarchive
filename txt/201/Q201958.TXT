SUMMARY
=======

The DataGrid Object code example contains several errors that prevent the sample
from working correctly. This article contains the correct code example for the
DataGrid Object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DataGrid Object is part of the Microsoft Chart Control, MSChart.ocx. You can
search Online Help for "DataGrid Object" and click on the Example hypertext to
see the faulty code sample that should demonstrate creating a three-dimensional
bar chart.

The following is the correct DataGrid Object code example:

       Private Sub Command1_Click()
          Dim rowLabelCount As Integer
          Dim columnLabelCount As Integer
          Dim rowCount As Integer
          Dim columnCount As Integer
          Dim labelIndex As Integer

          MSChart1.chartType = VtChChartType3dBar
          With MSChart1.DataGrid
             ' Set Chart parameters using methods.
             rowLabelCount = 2
             columnLabelCount = 2
             rowCount = 6
             columnCount = 6
             .SetSize rowLabelCount, columnLabelCount, _
             rowCount, columnCount

             ' Randomly fill in the data.
             .RandomDataFill
             ' Then assign labels to second Level.
             labelIndex = 2
             columnCount = 1
             .ColumnLabel(columnCount, labelIndex) = "Product 1"
             columnCount = 4
             .ColumnLabel(columnCount, labelIndex) = "Product 2"
             rowCount = 1
             .RowLabel(rowCount, labelIndex) = "1994"
             rowCount = 4
             .RowLabel(rowCount, labelIndex) = "1995"
          End With
       End Sub
