The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you are querying the "All users" collection in the Systems Management
Server Administrator Console, user names in the double-byte character set (DBCS)
are not sorted correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sort order shown in the Systems Management Server Administrator Console is
returned by Microsoft SQL Server. SQL Server does not allow more than one sort
order in a mixed code page environment.

NOTE: Most European fonts, including all ISO8859 code sets, are single-byte
fonts. Most Asian font sets, including the JIS (Japanese Kanji) fonts, are
double-byte fonts.

If a site hierarchy includes computers using different code pages, you must name
all network resources by using the standard ASCII characters (codes 0 through
127). This includes all computer names, share names, user names, user group
names, domain names, and site codes. If computers in your SMS site hierarchy all
use a common code page, there are no language-specific restrictions on network
resource names.
