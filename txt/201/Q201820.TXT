======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

The Remote Control window may display the wrong pointer when you move the
pointer from the Remote Control window to the Remote Tools window. The
double-headed arrow that appears when you resize a window does not change back
to a pointer.

NOTE: This behavior does not hinder the remote control session of the remote
computer.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, move the mouse between the Remote Control client
window and the Systems Management Server Management Console.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 2.0.
