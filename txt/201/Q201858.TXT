TITLE   :SMS: IP Address Cannot Be Used as SQL Server Name During Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing Systems Management Server 2.0 on the same computer as Microsoft
SQL Server, typing the IP address of that computer into the SQL Server Name
field in Systems Management Server setup causes an error.

CAUSE
=====

If you type an IP address instead of a server name in the SQL Server Name field,
Systems Management Server setup considers the SQL Server to be remote, even if
it is the local computer, and returns an error message indicating that the
database devices must be created manually.


WORKAROUND
==========

Make sure you use the server name (not the IP address) in the SQL Server name
field during Systems Management Server setup.
