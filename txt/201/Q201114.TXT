TITLE   :PRB: Windows 95 PCs Unable to Browse Remote Domain Across Router
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11,95; winnt:3.5,3.51,4.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 computers in a TCP/IP network are unable to browse a remote domain
across a router, but they are able to browse a local domain. Windows NT
computers are able to browse both the local and remote domains.

Both, Windows 95 and Windows NT computers are configured to use the same WINS
server, which has the correct Domain 1Bh entry for the remote domain. Users in
both systems are logging on to the local domain and have no accounts in the
remote domain. A trust relationship exists between both domains.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Windows 95 computer is configured to browse an
incorrect Workgroup.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, configure Windows 95 computers so the Workgroup
field in Network Configuration matches the name of the local domain (not remote
domain):

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. Click the Identification tab.

3. Change the Workgroup name.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
