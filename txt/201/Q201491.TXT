TITLE   :XWEB: OWA Does Not Display RTF Text in Contacts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2, 3 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Text entered into an Outlook contact as rich text format (RTF) displays as Plain
Text when viewed using Outlook Web Access (OWA). Any color or font changes made
are disregarded when viewing.

CAUSE
=====

Contacts in OWA do not have separate read and edit forms, like the Outlook and
Exchange clients do. The form OWA uses to edit and read contacts does not allow
RTF.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The reply form OWA uses for mail messages works the same way as the edit or read
forms. RTF is converted to Plain Text when replying to a message.
