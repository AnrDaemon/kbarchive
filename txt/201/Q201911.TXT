TITLE   :BUG: DCOMCNFG Writes Ports Named Value in Incorrect Format
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCOMt kbOSWinNT400 kbOSWin98 kbGrpDSCom kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM, included with:
    - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
    - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
    - Microsoft Windows 98 
    - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The DCOMCNFG utility writes the port range specified for a protocol in a
incorrect format.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a port range is specified for a protocol, such as 4000-4010, the value that
is written to the registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\RPC\Internet\Ports (named
REG_MULTI_SZ) is "4000 - 4010." A space is added preceding and succeeding the
"-". Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is extremly sensitive about the string format
and fails the RpcServerUsePortSeq call with RPC_S_OUT_OF_RESOURCES. As a result,
no client can talk to the server, and services such as Internet Information
Server (IIS) do not start.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the DCOMCNFG and click the Default Protocol tab.

2. Select the protocol, and add a port range to it.

3. Check the registry entry. You will see an incorrect port range format.
