SYMPTOMS
========

After you restart your AST Manhattan 6200 computer after applying Service Pack 4
(SP4), the computer will stop with an error code of 0x0000007B.

CAUSE
=====

The HAL used on AST Manhattan computers (Halapic.dll or Hal.mps) uses
information provided by the BIOS to determine system configuration. Windows NT,
prior to SP4, does not query the BIOS information for slot 0 on PCI buses. This
change uncovered an issue with the AMI BIOS version that is unique to the AST
Manhattan 6200 systems.

STATUS
======

AST is aware of this problem. For more information, contact AST Technical
Support at (800) 727-1278 or visit AST's Web site.
