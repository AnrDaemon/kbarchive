SUMMARY
=======

The Exchconn.ini file located in the Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn directory
contains the settings for the Microsoft Exchange Connectivity Controller as well
as the Exchange Server connectors for Lotus Notes, SNADS, and/or OV/VM.

Detailed help for this settings file can be found in the Linkini.hlp file also
located in the Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recommends using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program to
configure the Notes, SNADS, and OV/VM connectors, instead of directly editing
the Exchconn.ini file. Direct editing of this settings file may result in
improper functionality of the connector.
