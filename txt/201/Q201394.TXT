TITLE   :PRB: Only Project Folders Restored from Archive
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to restore an archive to a location other than where it was archived
from causes the SSRESTOR utility to report

   <project/file path> does not exist and the archive file contains only
   version ranges

and only the project structure of the archived files exists in Visual SourceSafe
Explorer.

CAUSE
=====

You tried to restore an archive that contains earlier versions of projects/files
but not the latest versions.

Visual SourceSafe uses Reverse Delta technology to store only the latest version
of a file, along with the information to recreate older versions of the file
when needed. When you archive using the -v switch option, you only archive the
changes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Archive and restore the remaining versions of the file or project prior to
restoring the archive that contains the earlier versions. Use the rollback
function if you only want the earlier versions saved to the new location.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Archiving with the -v switch is best used to remove old versions of files in
order to recover disk space or to make the Show History command work more
quickly (because it will have fewer versions to display). To move whole projects
to different databases while preserving history, archive and restore the entire
project.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Archive a file or files using the -v switch.

2. Try restoring the archived files to a different Visual SourceSafe database.
