TITLE   :XADM: Arcserve User Account Affects Database Restore
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Arcserve services under the security context of the local
system account and restore a database to a remote Microsoft Exchange Server
computer, you may receive the following error message when you try to restore
the Exchange database:

   HRRestoreRegister failed

The HRRestoreRegister function is called to create the "Restore in Progress"
registry key. This key is used to alter the normal Exchange Server computer
startup routines after an online restore.

If the service account that is used by the Arcserve services does not have proper
rights to the remote registry, the function call and the restore fails.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that you may be able to successfully back up the databases with the
Archserve agents by using the local system account.
