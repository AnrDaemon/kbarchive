TITLE   :XFOR: Error 'C1030B35' Configuring Exchange as DirSync Requestor
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up an Exchange Server computer to act as a directory
synchronization (dirsync) requestor, you may receive the following error
message:

   Error occurred while processing email address C1030B35. See the event log for
   more details.

No errors are reported in the application event log.

CAUSE
=====

There is already an Exchange Server computer in another site configured to act
as a dirsync requestor against the Microsoft Mail dirsync server. That site is
within the same Organization, and is replicating with your current site. Because
of this replication, the dirsync address (Network\Po\$system) for the dirsync
server that was to be created already exists within the Organization.

RESOLUTION
==========

It is recommended that you have only one dirsync requestor to the same dirsync
server in an Organization. The replication connector will migrate those MS Mail
user names to the global address list in all other connected sites.
