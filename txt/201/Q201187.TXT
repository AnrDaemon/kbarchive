TITLE   :Web Admin Ignores Spaces at the Beginning of Virtual Directories
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create virtual directories in the MMC (snap-in) interface with Internet
Information Server 4.0, virtual directory names that begin with a space or
spaces do not appear this way in the HTMLA Web Administration forms. They appear
with no space(s). For example, in the MMC, " vdir" (without the quotation marks)
appears, but in the HTMLA Admin, you will see "vdir" (with no space).

This can present a problem if you name the directory "VirtualRoot" (without the
quotation marks) and then have another directory named " VirtualRoot" (without
the quotation marks). In the HTMLA interface, it appears as though you have two
directories with the same name (because neither one has spaces in the name).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, do not use a space(s) at the beginning of virtual
directory names.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
4.0.
