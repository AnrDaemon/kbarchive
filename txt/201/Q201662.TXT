TITLE   :XADM: Exchange Event Service w. Internet Explorer 4.01 Hangs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP3,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer that is running Exchange Server build 5.5.1960, Windows NT Server
4.0 Service Pack 3, and Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01, when you right-click
the Internet Explorer icon on the desktop, click Properties on the shortcut
menu, and then click OK, the Windows NT logon shell (Explorer.exe) stops
responding (hangs).

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because Internet Explorer generates a windows broadcast
message to all top-level windows, and Internet Explorer is waiting for a
response. In the Exchange Server event service, although a window is not created
directly, one of the Component Object Model (COM) application programming
interfaces (API) creates a window resource internally. In the event service, the
broadcasted message is missed by one of the threads and another thread is
performing "if (Peek..." instead of "while(Peek" and misses the message
completely, so Internet Explorer hangs waiting for a response.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


You can also resolve this problem by upgrading to Windows NT Server 4.0 Service
Pack 4 and Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 with fix number 58842.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server version 5.5
Service Pack 2.
