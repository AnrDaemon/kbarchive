The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service now provides a directory to allow a
"drop-off" for SMTP RFC-821 formatted messages for delivery.

This functionality was added primarily for use with Active Messaging but can be
used for other mechanisms and troubleshooting also.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Internet Mail Service attempts to create the RFC-821 (SMTP) Mail From and
Rcpt To information from the "dropped" message. The preferred source for this
information is through the X-Sender and X-Receiver headers normally found in an
Active Messaging submission before the RFC-822 header information. If this
source is not found, the Internet Mail Service attempts to figure it out from
the RFC-822 header information (To, From, Sender). If both the Sender and From
fields are present, the Internet Mail Service will take the Sender field over
the From field.

If a file is placed in the Pickup directory that the Internet Mail Service
(through the Service Account) doesn't have permissions to move or delete, the
message will not be delivered. This is to prevent the Internet Mail Service from
sending messages multiple times. When this occurs, an event is logged. Also, the
Internet Mail Service will not pick up files larger than the maximum message
size configured for the Internet Mail Service.

Upon startup, the Internet Mail Service checks for the existence of a Pickup
directory under the Imcdata directory and checks for an Archive directory under
the Pickup directory. If one does not exist, the Internet Mail Service will
attempt to create it. If the Internet Mail Service is unsuccessful at creating
these directories, the Pickup directory functionality is disabled. Thus to
disable the Pickup functionality, just stop the Internet Mail Service, remove
permissions on the Pickup directory, and then restart the Internet Mail Service.
