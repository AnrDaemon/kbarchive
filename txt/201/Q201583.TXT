PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbButton kbCmnCtrls kbCtrl kbVBp kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A toolbar control that is placed on a Visual Basic form and aligned with the
left or right side of the form does not resize to fit a button that has a
caption wider than the width of the toolbar.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior

1. In Visual Basic 6.0, create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. On the Project menu, click Components, select Microsoft Windows Common
   Controls 6.0, and click OK.

3. Place a Toolbar control on Form1.

4. Place a CommandButton on the Toolbar by right-clicking it and selecting
   Properties. Click the Buttons tab and click Insert button.

5. In the Properties dialog box, change the Caption property for the
   CommandButton to This is a long caption and click OK.

6. In the Properties window, set the Align property for the Toolbar control to
   vbAlignLeft or vbAlignRight.

7. Run the program. Note that the Toolbar control does not resize to fit the
   CommandButton, and the button appears to be clipped. Setting the Width or
   ButtonWidth property of the Toolbar control has no effect on the size of the
   control.
