TITLE   :XFOR: EXCALCON May Fail to Connect to the CALCON Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Lotus Notes users may notice that all the Free/Busy (F/B) queries for Exchange
Server users are failing. This might indicate that the remote procedural call
(RPC) communication between the two systems is broken.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Calendar Connector(EXCALCON) task on the Notes server communicates
by means of RPC to the Calendar Connector (CALCON) on an Exchange Server
computer. Although the Exchange Calendar Connector task is supposed to be able
to re-establish RPC connectivity to the Calendar Connector, there is a small
chance that it will fail during the attempt. This will result in all F/B queries
from Notes for Exchange Server users to fail.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the Calendar Connector is back up and running, and that any
   network connectivity issues have been resolved.

2. On the Notes server, shut down the Exchange Server Add-on task.

3. Once the task has successfully shut down, restart the Exchange Calendar
   Connector Add-on task. For instructions on loading and shutting down the
   Exchange Calendar Connector Add-on task, refer to the documentation in the
   Exchsrvr\Connect\Calcon\Doc directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server 5.5.
