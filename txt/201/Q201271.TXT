======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Depending on the components selected during installation, Setup creates a
default directory structure that stores the Exchange Server 5.5 program files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following subdirectories are located in the root Exchsrvr directory folder:

Note: Exchsrvr is the default root directory. This can be changed during
installation and thus the subdirectories appear under the root directory name
that was specified during Setup.

 - Add-ins: Subdirectories for extensions to Exchange Server. The default
   installation contains dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) for the Microsoft Mail
   Connector, the Microsoft Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector, the Simple Mail
   Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and the Internet Mail Service.

 - Address: Subdirectories for e-mail address proxy DLLs. The default
   installation contains DLLs for Microsoft Mail for PC and AppleTalk Networks
   (now known as Quarterdeck Mail), the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus
   cc:Mail, SMTP, and X.400 e-mail address generators.

 - Bin: Components for Exchange Server and the Administrator program.

 - Ccmcdata: A directory structure that serves as a temporary storage location
   to hold messages during transit. Connector for Lotus cc:Mail uses this
   temporary storage space to move messages between Lotus cc:Mail and Exchange
   Server. This directory is created only if you select to install the Connector
   for Lotus cc:Mail component during Setup.

 - Connect: Components for various Exchange Server connectors. The default
   installation contains .exe files for the Internet Mail Service, the Microsoft
   Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector, Microsoft Mail for PC and AppleTalk Networks,
   Lotus cc:Mail, and translators for other languages.

 - Docs: Online documentation. This directory is created only if you select to
   install the online documentation component during Setup.

 - Dsadata: The directory database (Dir.edb) and Jet database logs (*.log).

 - Dxadata: The Directory Exchange Agent database (Xdir.edb) for Microsoft Mail
   for PC Networks (MS Mail (PC)). This directory is created only if you set up
   directory synchronization with an MS Mail (PC) network, which requires you to
   install a Microsoft Mail Connector component during Setup.

 - Imcdata: Working directories for the Internet Mail Service.

 - Insdata: Working directories for the Internet News Service. This directory is
   created whether or not you select to install the Internet News Service
   component during Setup.

 - Kmsdata: Working directory for the Key Management server (KM server). This
   directory contains the KM server database (Kmsmdb.edb) and Jet database logs
   (*.log). This directory is empty unless you select to install the KM server
   component during Setup.

 - Mdbdata: The private information store (Priv.edb), the public information
   store (Pub.edb), and the Jet database logs (*.log).

 - Mtadata: Configuration, template database, and log files for the message
   transfer agent (MTA).

 - Res: DLL files for the Microsoft Windows NT Event Viewer and the Windows NT
   Performance Monitor.

 - Tracking.log: Log files for the message-tracking feature of the Administrator
   program.

 - Webdata: Outlook Web Access (OWA) components. This directory is created only
   if you select to install the OWA component during Setup.

 - Webdata.bak: Backup files for the OWA components in the Webdata folder. This
   directory is created only if you select to install the OWA component during
   Setup.

 - Webtemp: Temporary files for the OWA component. This directory is created
   only if you select to install the OWA component during Setup.
