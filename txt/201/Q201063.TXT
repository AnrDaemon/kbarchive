-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you enroll Exchange Server users in Advanced Security using the Bulk
Enrollment option in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, tokens
are only assigned to valid Exchange Server mailboxes within the specified
container.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If there are custom recipients, public folders, or distribution lists in the
selected container, they will not be assigned a token for the setup of Advanced
Security. This is by Exchange Server design. Exchange Server mailboxes are the
only objects the Exchange Key Management Server will enroll in Advanced
Security.
