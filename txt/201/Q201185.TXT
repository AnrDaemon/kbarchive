PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:3.0

KEYWORDS:kbInternet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the NetBIOS name of the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 3.0
computer has 15 characters, the Internet tab does not appear in a directory's
property sheet. IIS may fail to return Web pages and occasionally the WWW
Service does not start.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the NetBIOS name of the Windows NT Server computer
running IIS 3.0 contains more than 14 characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, reduce the number of characters in the NetBIOS name of
the IIS 3.0 computer to 14 charters or less.
