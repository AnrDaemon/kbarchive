TITLE   :SMS: Software Inventory Corruption in SQL Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SQL database shows several corrupted items (a date, time, path, or just
miscellaneous characters) in the Software_COMM and the Software_SPEC tables.

This happens when you perform a query and select the Software Group. Unwanted
items appear in the drop-down list.

WORKAROUND
==========

Go to Systems Management Server Database Manager and select Delete Group
Classes. Go to Personal Computer architecture, select Software, and click OK.
This action deletes the Software_COMM and the Software_SPEC tables in the SQL
database.

Go to Systems Management Server Administrator and resend all of the Packages set
up to take software inventory. (This will re-create fresh software inventory
tables in the SQL database)

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Until the Software Inventory tables are rebuilt, Systems Management
Server Admin will not display any Software Inventory information for all users.
