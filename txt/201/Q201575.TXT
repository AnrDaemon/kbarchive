SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines how to configure your Services for UNIX telnet server to
use the Korn Shell (Sh.exe) in place of the default logon shell (Cmd.exe).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following instructions assume that Services for UNIX has been installed to
the C:\SFU directory. This is not the default directory, but it is easier to
show. The assumption is also made that you have created a user named TelnetUser
and assigned this user a home directory of F:\home\TelnetUser.

1. Run Notepad and insert the following lines:

   @echo off
   C:\SFU\Shell\SH.EXE -rL

2. Save this file as C:\SFU\Telnet\shell.bat.

3. Create a new file in Notepad and insert the following lines:

      EDITOR=vi
      export EDITOR
      alias ll="ls -l"
      alias la="ls -a"
      USERNAME=`basename $PWD`
      export USERNAME
      USER=$USERNAME
      export USER
      LOGNAME=$USERNAME
      export LOGNAME
      echo
      echo
      echo "Welcome to the Korn Shell!"
      echo
      echo

4. Save this file as F:\home\TelnetUser\profile.ksh.

5. Run Tlntadmn.exe from Start, Run or from a command prompt.

6. Select selection number 3 to make a registry change.

7. Select selection number 4 to change the default shell.

8. Change DefaultShell to C:\SFU\Telnet\shell.bat

9. Select selection number 0 to exit this menu.

10. Select selection number 5 to stop the Telnet service.

11. Select selection number 4 to start the Telnet service.

12. Telnet in and test your modifications.

If you need to go back to the default Cmd.exe shell, the following is the exact
syntax used for DefaultShell:

   %SystemRoot%\System32\Cmd.exe /q /k
