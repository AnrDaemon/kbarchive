SUMMARY
=======

In Systems Management Server 2.0, administrators have the ability to limit users
of licensed software by adding or importing Windows NT users and groups from
Windows NT domain controllers. This is a function of software metering and is
done in Resource Manager. When you add a Windows NT user or group in Resource
Manager, you do not specify Windows NT domains. Therefore, you cannot add a user
or group with the same name from two different Windows NT domains.

Resource Manager does not distinguish between user or group names from different
domains. This is by design.
