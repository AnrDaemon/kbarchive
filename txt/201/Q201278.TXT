TITLE   :XFOR: 16-bit CCMARCH Does Not Support DBCS in Privdir.ini File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The 16-bit version of the cc:Mail Archive Importer (CCMARCH) does not translate
double byte character set (DBCS) characters to Unicode.

CAUSE
=====

When you migrate users from Lotus cc:Mail to Exchange Server, messages with DBCS
characters are not migrated properly. Microsoft Windows 3.1 does not support
Unicode. Thus, CCMARCH cannot map DBCS characters to Unicode during the
migration process from Lotus cc:Mail to Exchange Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the 16-bit version of the
cc:Mail Archive Importer.
