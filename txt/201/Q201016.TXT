TITLE   :SMS: All Senders Except Courier Sender Log to Sender.log

KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbSender kbSMSSender

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Systems Management Server tracing is enabled, Systems Management Server
components will log their activity to the Smsroot\Logs directory (Smsroot is the
default installation directory for Systems Management Server). By default, all
Systems Management Server senders (with the exception of the Courier Sender,
which logs to the Coursend.log log file by default) will log to Sender.log. When
attempting to analyse a particular sender's log output, the Sender.log file can
prove difficult to read.

CAUSE
=====

All sender code (with the exception of the Courier Sender) is maintained within
a single binary (Sender.dll), which logs output for the Standard Sender,
Asynchronous RAS Sender, ISDN RAS Sender, X25 RAs Sender, and SNA RAS Sender to
Sender.log.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you view the Sender.log file using the Systems Management Server Tracer, you
can click View, click Filter, and then click Filter by Component to selectively
view log output produced by one particular sender type.

As an alternative, the Systems Management Server Service Manager for Systems
Management Server 2.0 can be used to change the log file name used by a selected
sender component:

1. From the Components node, select the sender for which you want to change the
   log file name (for example, SMS_ASYNC_RAS_SENDER).

2. Select the Logging entry from the Component menu or press CTRL+L.

3. Change the log file name to a new name to which you want the component to
   log.

4. Stop and restart the SMS_EXECUTIVE to enable the component to log to the new
   file.

This method will allow a specified sender to log to a dedicated log file for that
sender type. This procedure may be beneficial if the log file is to be analysed
over a long period.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
