TITLE   :SMS: Windows 9x NetWare Clients Not Running SMS Logon Script
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbBindery kbCAP kbOSNovell

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a Windows 9x NetWare client that is using the Microsoft Client for NetWare
logs on to a Novell NetWare server, it might not correctly run the System
Management Server 2.0 login script (Smsls.scr). As a result, the client computer
may not verify the System Management Server client software and report
inventory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the System Management Server 2.0 SMS_LOGON_MANAGER enumerates a Novell
NetWare Bindery mode server, it adds an INCLUDE statement to the system logon
script that calls the Smsls.scr from the SMSLOGON share, as shown here:

   REM Microsoft Systems Management Server <start>
   REM Important! DO NOT REMOVE THE LINES: Microsoft Systems Management Server <start> AND <end> OR ANY LINES BETWEEN THESE

   REM SMS Build xxxx

   Set SMS_LOGON_NW="DATA:\SMSLOGON"
   Set SMS_LOGON="\\\<servername>\DATA\SMSLOGON"
   INCLUDE %<SMS_LOGON_NW>\CONFIG\smsls.scr

   REM Microsoft Systems Management Server <end>

If "Enable logon script processing" is not selected in Control Panel, the client
will not run the system logon script. On the Microsoft version of the NetWare
redirector, this option is not enabled by default. To enable logon script
processing:

1. On the Taskbar, click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel.

2. Double-click the NetWare Networks icon.

3. Click the Properties tab and click to select the Enable logon script
   processing check box.
