capitalization of the keywords contained in the file. The following code
accomplishes this:

      *-- Code begins here
      USE HOME()+"WIZARDS\FDKEYWRD"
      REPLACE ALL Token WITH PROPER(Token)
      USE
      *-- Code ends here

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

1. Enter the following into an editing window:

       CLEAR
       SET CLOCK ON
       CLOSE DATA

2. Select the code. Right-click the Editing window and click Beautify.

3. Click Mixed case in the Keywords list box. Click Run.

   Note that only CLEAR is changed to Mixed case capitalization.
