SUMMARY
=======

If there is more than one Calendar provider configured, the Calendar Connector
service automatically starts all configured providers as well as some general
administrative processes in the background.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may want to isolate certain providers for troubleshooting purposes without
having to remove each individual calendar connection information in the Calendar
Connector property page.

There are six potential processes that the Calendar Connector may run, they are:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Provider Name | Description                                                | 
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| CALSYNC       | Process for updating all F/B records for custom recipients | 
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADMINSVC      | General cleanup process                                    | 
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| MAPICAL       | Provider for the information store-F/B public folder       | 
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTESCAL      | Provider for Lotus Notes                                   | 
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GWISECAL      | Provider for GroupWise                                     | 
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| PROFSCAL      | Provider for OV/VM                                         | 
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

To isolate specific providers, open up the registry with regedt32 or regedit.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Go to HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeCalCon\Parameters.

2. Add the following for troubleshooting the Notes provider. To troubleshoot
   other providers, simply change the NOTESCAL provider name to the desired
   provider, for example, GWISECAL.

   Value Name: Providers
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   String: MAPICAL, NOTESCAL

3. Start up the Calendar Connector in console mode (refer to the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base):

   Q197372 XFOR: How to Run Calendar Connector in Console Mode

4. Notice that the Calendar Connector only loads the two processes you want.
