SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a printer by using the AppleTalk network protocol, your print
job may not print at all.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you use a Printer Control Language (PCL) printer
driver to print to a printer that is connected to an AppleTalk network using a
Hewlett Packard (HP) JetDirect network printer adapter. When a PCL print job is
sent to the printer, the JetDirect adapter formats the data for use with a
PostScript printer, and this results in the data being unusable.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install a PostScript printer driver for your printer. For
information about installing a printer driver in Windows NT, see the "Setting Up
a Printer" topic in Windows NT Help.
