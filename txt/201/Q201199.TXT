KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup exc55kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Exchange Server 5.5 administrators may find the following event log entry posted
when the information store is started:

   EVENT ID: 13005 Source: MSexchange IMAP4 TYPE: Information Category: (4)

The following event log is produced when the information store is started:

   Microsoft Commercial Internet Server (MCIS) or Microsoft Internet Information
   Server (IIS) version 4.0 may be present but not configured for Secure Sockets
   Layer (SSL) security, or not present at all.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server administrator configured the site level IMAP protocol object
to use authentication type MCIS Membership System with Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL), but did not install Membership System in the site, or if installed,
neglected to configure it to be SSL-capable. The event log entry is a warning
that the protocol object is misconfigured.

WORKAROUND
==========

Install Microsoft Commercial Internet System (MCIS) if it is not already
present, and match its settings to those chosen on the protocol object. After
Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), and Exchange
Server have been installed and configured, follow these steps to enable SSL
authentication:

1. Select Authentication Settings for Exchange Server:

   a. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, expand the Configuration
      container, and click Protocols.

   b. Double-click IMAP4.

   c. On the IMAP4 Property page, click the Authentication tab and set the
      authentication levels.

   d. Click OK to save the settings.

2. Create Key Request:

   a. Start the Key Manager included with Internet Information Server.

   b. Locate the Exchange Server computer, and click IMAP4.

   c. On the Key menu and then click Create New Key.

   d. Type the appropriate information in the fields, and click OK to save the
      information to a "request" file.

   e. Send the key request to a certificate distribution company (such as
      Verisign) to obtain a certificate for the server.

3. Install the Certificate:

   a. After you obtain the certificate, start the Key Manager included with
      Internet Information Server.

   b. Locate the Exchange Server computer, and click IMAP4.

   c. On the Key menu, click Install Key Certificate.

   d. Select the certificate file sent by the certificate vendor.

   e. On the Servers menu, click Commit Changes Now.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
