TITLE   :SMS: Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 Upgrade Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbSoftwareDist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Package Command Manager might not complete the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3
upgrade successfully if some system files on the client are newer than the
source package.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PACMAN (PCM service log) on the client will show the following:

Job still running............~   $$<SMS_PACKAGE_COMMAND_MANAGER_NT><Thu Aug 27 07:29:22 1998~><thread=8D>
Job still running............~   $$<SMS_PACKAGE_COMMAND_MANAGER_NT><Thu Aug 27 07:29:25 1998~><thread=8D>
Job still running............~   $$<SMS_PACKAGE_COMMAND_MANAGER_NT><Thu

The log will display the same lines over and over.

This can occur when you have updated a .dll file from an application such as
Internet Explorer or possibly added an updated network card driver from the
hardware manufacturer. The latest driver is already on the system and Service
Pack 3 is trying to prompt to overwrite the file.

When you attempt to manually upgrade to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3, you
receive the following message:

   Source D:\i386\filename.exe

   Target C:\winnt\system32\filename.exe

   The target file exists and is newer than the source.

   Overwrite the newer file?

   No    No to All   Yes

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. A
supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
