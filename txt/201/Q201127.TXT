SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to set up the Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail
Service to reroute SMTP message to different Exchange Organizations using the
SMTP protocol.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Scenario
--------

 - Two Exchange Organizations on the same segment:

    - Org1: Microsoft (domain: Microsoft.com) (Site:abc) (Server:123)
    - Org2: Microsoft-Europe (domain: Microsoft-Europe.com and
      Microsoft-Africa.com) (Site:def) (Server:456)

 - MX records for all domains are pointing to the Exchange Server (Microsoft)

Configuration
-------------

1. On the Microsoft-Europe Organization, open the Internet Mail Service
   Properties page, and on the Routing tab, remove the Microsoft.com domain.

2. Keep the Microsoft-Europe.com and Microsoft-Africa.com domains as inbound.

3. Stop and re-start the Internet Mail Service.

4. On the Microsoft Organization, open the Internet Mail Service Properties
   page, and on the Routing tab, remove all domains except Microsoft.com; keep
   Microsoft.com as inbound only.

5. Go to the Connections tab, and under Message Delivery, click E-mail Domain.
   In the "Forward all messages for this domain to host" box, add the
   Microsoft-Europe.com and Microsoft-Africa.com domains, and enter the IP of
   the Microsoft-Europe mail server.

6. Stop and re-start the Internet Mail Service.

7. Make sure that either Domain Name System (DNS) is configured with correct
   host records, or use the Hosts file for proper hostname resolution.
