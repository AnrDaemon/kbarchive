TITLE   :BUG: Explorer May Incorrectly Display Auditing Settings
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you programmatically set auditing on a file for some events, the
corresponding check boxes do not appear in Explorer's auditing dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

Auditing is set correctly on the file and the appropriate audits are being
generated. The audit properties dialog box in Explorer is not displaying the
audit settings accurately, and can be ignored.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, use the same tool to view the SACL as you used to
manipulate the System Access Control List (SACL).

To resolve this problem, use the new security user interface in Explorer that is
installed when you add the Security Configuration Editor component of Service
Pack 4, which does not exhibit this problem.
