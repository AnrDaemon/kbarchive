======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When 16-bit clients run the logon script over Bindery services, the following
error may appear within the client's logon script window:

   ERROR: \\<servername>\SYS\SMLOGON\X86.bin\SMSNW1.EXE returned 34819!
   Cannot run the SMS bootstrap!

The boot process will continue and the client is successfully discovered and
installed. This error occurs when running the NetWare VLM client from Microsoft
Windows 3.1 or Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and not when the user logs
on from MS-DOS.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
