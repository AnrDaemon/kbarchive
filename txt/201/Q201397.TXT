TITLE   :SMSINST: Custom Dialogs May Contain Blank Controls
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsInst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Systems Management Server Installer custom dialog is displayed to the
screen as part of a compiled script, one or more controls on the dialog may
appear blank.

CAUSE
=====

A change was made to the Installer after version 1.00.04 which can affect the
display of dialog controls. If a dialog contains one or more controls which
contain Installer variables that have not been previously initialized within the
script, the controls listed in the Tab Order after the use of an un-initialized
variable will be displayed with blank text.

WORKAROUND
==========

The symptoms can be prevented using the following methods:

 - Within the SMS Installer Script Editor, review the names of the variables
   used within Custom Dialogs which are affected by the problem. At a convenient
   point prior to the Custom Dialog item, define the variables using the Set
   Variable script item. If the variables will be initially blank simply use the
   Set Variable script action to initialize the variable to nothing.

 - Within Custom Dialog Editor the Layout, Set Tab Order menu item can be used
   to set the precedence of each control within the Custom Dialog. If there are
   only a few controls containing un-initialized variables within the Custom
   Dialog, they can be left as the last controls within the Tab Order. This
   method is also known to prevent the display of blank controls.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 1.0.
