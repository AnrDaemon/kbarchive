SUMMARY
=======

A Windows-based application that performs a long, background task, such as
repaginating a word processing document, can be designed in a number of
different ways.

A polling task can be accomplished by setting a timer to fire at the desired
interval. Many non-polling tasks can be performed in pieces. Although Windows
does not have a method to schedule processing based on overall system load, an
application can wait until there are no other messages to be processed by that
application before proceeding. This article discusses the code required to
implement this method.

NOTE: This polling method is unnecessary for native Win32 applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is important that each piece of the task be relatively small. This allows
Windows to devote processing time to other applications running in the system.
Similarly, once the task is complete, it is important that the application
signal that it is idle. This allows Windows to optimize its performance and to
prolong battery life on portable computers.

The following code skeleton demonstrates how this might be implemented:

      WinMain
      {
      do application initialization

      fBackgroundToDo = TRUE;
      fRunning = TRUE;

      while (fBackgroundToDo && fRunning)
           {
           if (fBackgroundToDo)
                {
                if ((PeekMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE))
                     {
                     if (msg.message == WM_QUIT)
                          {
                          fRunning = FALSE;
                          break;
                          }

                     TranslateMessage(&msg);
                     DispatchMessage(&msg);
                     }
                else
                     fBackgroundToDo = DoABitOfBackground();
                }
           else if ((fRunning = GetMessage(&msg, NULL, NULL, NULL)) != 0)
                {
                TranslateMessage(&msg);
                DispatchMessage(&msg);

                fBackgroundToDo = IsThereBackgroundToDo();
                }
           }
      }
