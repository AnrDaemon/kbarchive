SUMMARY
=======

If you use DlgDirSelect() to get the selection from a list box and there is no
selection, DlgDirSelect() returns zero and leaves the output string unchanged.

Clicking in the white space after the last item in a list box is one reason there
may not be a selection.

Because DlgDirSelect() returns 0 (zero) when the selection is a file and 0 when
there is no selection at all, using the return value alone is not enough to
determine if there is a current selection. One way to determine if there is a
selection is to send the LB_GETCURSEL message to the list box. If the return
value is not LB_ERR from this message, there currently is a selected item in the
list box.
