SYMPTOMS
========

After you change the password for the Cluster service account on a domain
controller, the second node may not be able to join the cluster. Either of the
following events may be logged in the System event log:

   Event ID: 1107
   Source: ClusSvc
   Description: Cluster node <xxxxxxx> failed to make a connection to the
   node over network 'Public'. The error code was 5.

   -an-

   Event ID: 1079
   Event Source: ClusSvc
   Description: The node cannot join the cluster because it cannot communicate
   with node <xxx> over any network configured for internal cluster
   communication. Check the network configuration of the node and the cluster.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you did not restart the Cluster service. You must stop
and restart the Cluster service on both nodes after you change either the
Cluster service account or the Cluster service password.

The Cluster service uses NTLM for all authentication processes. After the Cluster
service starts on the node that is joining the cluster, the joining node's
credentials are validated by a domain controller. After the node's credentials
are validated on the domain, the node starts the process of joining the existing
cluster. To do so, the node passes its credentials to the existing node and
requests for a remote procedure call (RPC) binding to be created. During this
process, the existing node's local security authority validates the credentials
of the joining node with a domain controller. If the node is valid, the local
security authority receives an access token (password hash) for the joining node
from the domain controller. Finally, the Cluster service on the existing node
validates the credentials. Because the service account is the same, the existing
node compares its own token with the token of the joining node. The service
account of the joining node is validated, and then allowed to join if both
tokens match. However, if you do not restart the Cluster service on the existing
node, the existing node still has the token that was created by using the old
password. The tokens do not match and the Cluster service on the joining node
reports an "Error 5 (Access Denied)" error message.

The authentication process is first attempted on the public network interface. If
authentication fails, it is attempted on the private network interface.
Therefore, two event ID 1107 messages are associated with the authentication
failure.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, stop and restart the Cluster service on both nodes
after you either change the Cluster service account or reset the password.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recommends that you use the same service account for all nodes in a
cluster. For more information about how to either change the service account or
reset the Cluster service account password, refer to Windows Online Help.
