TITLE   :PRB: IIS4: "The Document Is Damaged and Cannot Be Repaired"
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error is generated when you attempt to open an Adobe .pdf file by
using the Microsoft Internet Explorer ActiveX control or the Netscape Navigator
plug-in for Adobe Acrobat Reader if the .pdf file is located on a server that is
running Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) with Sygate Personal
Firewall 4.0 installed:

   The document is damaged and cannot be repaired.

CAUSE
=====

The Sygate Personal Firewall dynamic link library, Wps.dll, is modifying the
HTTP response from the IIS server after the server attempts to transmit the
proper response.

The embedded Adobe Acrobat Reader requests portions of the file rather than
downloading the entire file. It does this by requesting byte ranges that are
based on the HTTP RFC. IIS correctly calculates the file offsets from which to
read and attempts to transmit those byte ranges. Wps.dll changes the file offset
to 0 for each byte range that is requested.

Wps.dll is loaded in the IIS address space.

RESOLUTION
==========

Sygate Technical support reports this behavior as resolved in Sygate Personal
Firewall 5.0. Contact Sygate Technical Support for information about removing
Sygate Personal Firewall 4.0 and obtaining Sygate Personal Firewall 5.0.
