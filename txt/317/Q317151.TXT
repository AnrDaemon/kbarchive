TITLE   :Non-Paged Pool Memory Leak with Emulex Fibre SCSI Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:ocsso

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an Emulex Fibre Channel PCI Host Bus Adapter is installed on a Windows
NT-based computer, the computer's performance may degrade or the computer may
stop responding (hang) because of a memory leak. For example, you may experience
one or more of the following behaviors:

 - Performance Monitor displays a consistent increase in non-paged pool memory
   usage.

 - Performance Monitor logs indicate a negative value for the Pool Nonpaged
   Bytes counter.

 - The pool tag, which indicates the location of the memory leak, is TMRL.

 - The computer stops responding (hangs) or displays a STOP error message
   similar to one of the following on a blue screen:

   Stop 0x0000000a (0x00000002 0x00000002 0x00000001 0x80208669)

   Stop 0x0000002d (0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000)

   STOP 0xffffffff (0x00001310 0x61315c6e 0x74345c73 0x6c697363)


CAUSE
=====

The TMRL pool tag indicates that the memory leak is caused by the Emulex Fibre
Channel SCSI driver, Elxsli2.sys. This behavior can occur if the driver is of
the following version and date stamp:

   Version v4-1.24
   December 14, 1999

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact Emulex to determine whether an updated driver is
available that can resolve this behavior.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use an earlier version of the driver with which you
do not experience the behavior described in the "Symptoms" section of this
article.
