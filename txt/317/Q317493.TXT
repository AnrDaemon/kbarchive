The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you build a project that includes a program or method that contains the
NewObject function, and the program passes the NewObject function a long
parameter that calls a Visual FoxPro function, the following error messages may
appear:

   Unable to find Visual Class Library PASSING A LONG STRING AS A NEWOBJECT()
   EPARAMETER1,

   -and-

   Unable to find Visual Class Library VFP 7

This problem does not occur when the parameter does not contain a Visual FoxPro
function call.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. This problem was first corrected in Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0
Service Pack 1.
