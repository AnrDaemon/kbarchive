   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your Windows NT 4.0-based computer, you may receive the following
error message:

   Stop c000021a {Fatal System Error}
   The session manager initialization system process terminated unexpectedly with
   a status of 0xc0000017 (0x00000000, 0x0000000) The system has been shut down.

After you receive this error message, your computer may restart so quickly that
you are unable to obtain the details of the memory address. This symptom may
prevent Windows NT from being able to write a valid Memory.dmp file. You may be
unable to resolve this issue by disabling all third-party services, or by
repairing your Windows NT installation by using an ERD.

CAUSE
=====

The error message that is listed in the "Symptoms" section of this article is
often caused by pending file-rename operations that are scheduled in the Windows
NT registry, but that cannot be completed.

Programs or Setup programs may schedule a file to be renamed on the next restart
of Windows NT if the program is prevented from renaming a file because the file
is in memory.

Windows NT checks a registry key for file-rename operations to be completed early
in the boot process. If the file-rename operation cannot be completed because
the file or folder does not exist, the error message that is listed in the
"Symptoms" section of this article is generated.


RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue:

1. Create a parallel installation of Windows NT.

For additional information how to do so, click the article number below to view
the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q259003 How and Why to Perform a Parallel Installation of Windows NT 4.0

2. Start your computer to the parallel installation of Windows NT, and then
   start Registry Editor.

3. On the Window menu, click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE on Local Machine.

4. On the Registry menu, click Load Hive.

5. Type the path to the System hive of the prior installation, typically
   "%systemroot%\system32\config\system" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click "Open" (without the quotation marks).

6. When you are prompted for the name of the key, type "TEST" (without the
   quotation marks), and then view the following registry entry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\Select

7. Note the setting for the Current DWord value in the preceding registry key.
   This is typically 0x1, and is represented as CURRENT:Reg_Dword:0x1. This
   value indicates that the "CurrentControlSet" for your original Windows NT
   installation corresponds to ControlSet001 in this window. A value of 2 would
   indicate that the "CurrentControlSet" for your original Windows NT
   installation would correspond to ControlSet002, and so on.

8. Locate the following registry key

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\ControlSetXXX\Control\Session Manager

   where XXX is the CurrentControlSet that you identified in the preceding step.

9. Under the Session Manager key, note and then delete any
   PendingFileRenameOperations entries.

10. Click the TEST hive, and then click Unload Hive on the Registry menu.

11. On the Registry menu, click Load Hive.

12. Type the path to the Software hive of the prior installation, typically
   "%systemroot%\system32\config\Software" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click Open.

13. When you are prompted for the name of the key, type "TEST2" (without the
   quotation marks).

14. Remove any PendingFileRenameOperations entries in the following registry
   keys:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST2\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST2\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx

15. Click the TEST2 hive, and then click Unload Hive on the Registry menu.

16. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart your original installation.
