TITLE   :PRB: If You Rebind Only the Solution File, Change Can't Check In
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbGrpDSSSafe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 6.0c, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET (2002), Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to rebind only the solution file that originally contained a project,
and if you do not rebind the project, you cannot check in changes. The file is
left in a state of pending check in.

NOTE: This problem may also occur with multiple projects and files.

CAUSE
=====

The solution file, which is still under source control, references a valid
project that is also still under source control. This occurs, even though the
project is unbound.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - If you want to keep the project, rebind both the solution and the project.

   -or-

 - If you do not want to keep the project and its history, delete and remove the
   project from the Visual SourceSafe explorer, and then rebind the solution.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a database project in the Visual Studio .NET integrated development
   environment (IDE).

2. Add the solution file to source control.

3. Unbind the solution. On the File menu, click Source Control, and then click
   Change Source Control.

4. Use the Change Source Control dialog box to rebind only the solution.
