TITLE   :PRB: FrontPage Web Projects Are Only Partially Under Source Code
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 6.0c 
 - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET (2002), Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you develop web projects in a team development environment and you use
Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions as your web source code control (SCC)
integration method, you can lose data when multiple users edit a project if you
modify the project directly from the Microsoft Internet Information Services
(IIS) instead of checking out the project from the SCC Provider through the
Visual Sudio .NET integrated development environment (IDE).

CAUSE
=====

This data loss can occur because the second user modifies the web project before
the first user has added the project to source control.

FrontPage Web Projects are only partially under source control until every user
opens and refreshes the project. Visual Studio .NET is designed for every user
to access the integrated source control environment through the Visual Studio
.NET IDE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Work only through your source code control provider and the Visual Studio .NET
IDE. Do not work directly from the web server when you are in a team development
environment.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. User 1 - create a FrontPage web: open a new Microsoft C# ASP.NET project, and
   then change Project type to FrontPage Server Extensions.

   To do this in the Visual Studio .NET IDE:

   a. On the Tools menu, click Options, click Projects, click Web settings and
      then change Preferred access method to FrontPage Extensions (from the
      default setting of File share).

   b. Share the Web Projects folder that is in the Inetpub\Wwwroot folder.

2. User 2 - on the File menu, click Open, click Project from Web, and then
   browse by means of the UNC path to the web folder's shared location.

3. User 1 - add the web to the source code control system by using IIS
   integration:

   a. Start the IIS Server Manager, right-click the web project, and then click
      Properties.

   b. On the Server Extensions tab, change Version control method to Use
      Internal.

4. User 1 - close and then reopen the solution to refresh the project status.

5. User 2 - make the following changes:

   a. Add two web forms to the project, and then save them.

   b. Open and change one of the forms.

   c. Delete the form that you did not change.

   d. On the File menu, click Save All. You may receive the following error
      message:

   An error occurred saving the project file <projectname.csproj>. Access
   is denied.

   e. If you receive this error message, edit the project options (described in
      step 1) to change Preferred access method to FrontPage Extensions.

6. User 1 - right-click the root project, and then click Checkout.

NOTE: The forms that User 2 added in step 5a are not added to the project when
User 1 clicks Get latest version. User 2 loses the webforms that were created
during the process and retains some of the dependent files.
