SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to remove the IISLockdown Wizard from a
Web server and restore the configuration and settings that were changed when the
IISLockdown Wizard was run.

Introduction
------------

If you run the IISLockdown Wizard (Iislockd.exe) from the Microsoft Security
Toolkit and immediately notice problems with Internet Information Services
(IIS), you may run the wizard again to undo the changes that the IISLockdown
Wizard has made to the computer.

Note that the undo operation may not be successful if you have made changes to
the system between the time when the IISLockdown Wizard was originally run and
when the undo task is run. Also, note that the Wizard can undo only the changes
that the Wizard has made. The Wizard cannot undo manual changes that you have
made to the server configuration.

The undo feature uses the log file, Oblt-log.log, that is created at the time
Iislockd.exe is originally run. Oblt-log.log is based on the changes that are
recorded in the log, but it does not record any unused services that you have
uninstalled. As a result, the undo feature does not restore any previously
uninstalled services.

Undo Changes Made by the IISLockdown Wizard
-------------------------------------------

1. Double-click the Iislockd.exe file.

2. On the This Server Was Already Configured page, read the explanatory text,
   and then click Next.

3. The IIS Lockdown Wizard appears and informs you that the process will undo
   the changes that were made when you last ran the Wizard. Click Yes to
   continue.

4. On the Restoring Security Settings page, you can see the previous settings
   that are restored. When the process is complete, you see "Finished" in the
   Status area. Note that this can take a significant amount of time based on
   the complexity of the IIS configuration. Click Next.

NOTE: This process does not restore any services that were removed if you
selected Remove unselected services when you originally ran the IISLockdown
Wizard.

5. On the Restoration Complete page, click Finish.
