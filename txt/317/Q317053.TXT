SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Windows normally or in Safe mode (VGA mode), the
computer may stop responding and you may receive the following STOP
(blue-screen) error message:

   STOP 0x00000067 (0x00000004, 0x00000008, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)
   CONFIG_INITIALIZATION_FAILED.

NOTE: This behavior can also occur when you attempt to start Windows Setup from
the Windows CD-ROM.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior indicates that the Windows registry is unable to allocate the
memory pool needed to contain the registry files. This may be caused by a
defective random access memory (RAM) module.

RESOLUTION
==========

To troubleshoot this issue, replace the RAM modules in the computer, and then
attempt to start Windows. If the problem persists, disable caching on the
motherboard. If doing this resolves the issue, contact the motherboard
manufacturer for diagnostic information.
