PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 6.0c, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET (2002), Professional Edition 
    - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET (2002), Enterprise Architect Edition 
    - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET (2002), Enterprise Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Source control operations fail when the status of source control has not been
updated in Visual Studio.

Examples of this behavior occur in the following scenarios:

 - After you enable multiple checkouts, Visual Studio does not allow you to
   perform multiple checkouts.

 - When you click Get Latest Version after another user has recently updated a
   file, Visual Studio does not provide the latest copy of the file.

CAUSE
=====

Visual Studio has cached an out-of-date source control server state.

RESOLUTION
==========

Close and then reopen Visual Studio to refresh the source control cache.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Scenario 1: Visual Studio Does Not Allow Multiple Checkouts After You Enable
Multiple Checkouts

1. In Visual SourceSafe Administrator, disable multiple checkouts. To do this,
   on the Tools menu, click Options and then disable multiple checkouts on the
   General tab.

2. In Visual Studio, add an entire solution to source control. To do this, on
   the File menu, click Source Control, and then click Add Solution to Source
   Control.

3. In Visual SourceSafe Explorer, use a different user to check out one of the
   files in the solution that you added in step 2.

   When you attempt to check out the same file in Visual Studio, the operation
   fails.

4. In Visual SourceSafe Administrator, enable multiple checkouts. To do this, on
   the Tools menu, click Options and then enable multiple checkouts on the
   General tab.

When you attempt to check out the same file in Visual Studio, sometimes the
checkout fails unexpectedly, as if the Multiple Checkouts option is still
disabled.
Scenario 2: Get Latest Version of a File That Another User Recently Checked In

1. User1 checks in a file.

2. User2 clicks Get Latest Version of the same file.

The expected behavior is that User2 now has the version that User1 just checked
in. However, sometimes the file can appear unchanged to User2.
