-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.1, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows XP 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add application mappings in Internet Information Services (IIS) on a
computer that is running Windows XP Professional Edition, the OK button is
unavailable after you type or browse to the path of the .exe file or the .dll
file and type the file name extension.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the individual Web site or the Web Sites folder, and then click
   Properties.

2. On the Home Directory tab, click Configuration.

3. Under Application Configuration, click Add, and then click the Mappings tab.

4. With the Add/Edit Application Extension Mapping dialog box open, click Browse
   to select the .exe file or the .dll file from the local path on the Web
   server.

   NOTE: You must type the path to a valid file in the Executable text box or the
   OK button remains unavailable. The easiest way to make sure that you enter a
   valid path is to select the file by using the Browse button.

5. After the path appears in the Executable text box, click in the Executable
   text box to initialize the path.

6. Click in the Extension space, and then type the file name extension.

   NOTE: You must enter the period (.) in front of the extension in the Extension
   text box, or the OK button remains unavailable.

7. When the OK button becomes active, click OK to continue.
