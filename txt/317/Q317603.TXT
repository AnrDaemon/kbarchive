SUMMARY
=======

If you start the SNA Server service (Snaservr.exe), the following warning event
may be posted in the application log of the Event Viewer:

   Event 630 - Source: SNA Host Security

   RPC Layer returned error 0x5 (Access is denied.) This may happen if host
   security is not installed or the user account the service is running under is
   not privileged to send messages to the remote end.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SNA Server service initializes the Host Security DLL (Snasii.dll) when the
service starts. During this process, Snasii.dll attempts to locate a domain
controller (DC) to find a valid host account cache (HAC) database. This DLL is
initialized even if Host Security Integration is not installed.

In cases where Host Security is used, this event may be logged if the service
account under which the SNA Server service is running does not have proper
rights to access the DC and locate the HAC.

Following is a section of a SNA Server internal trace file (Nodeintx.atf), that
shows a failure due to security:

   SendLocateMessage GetDomainPdc returned PDC \\<Server_Name>, NT Domain

   SendGenericMessage Opened connection to server type MDB on protocol ncacn_np

   SendGenericMessage About to invoke RPC on binding
   b1c7c350-c091-11cf-a65e-0020afc28c52@ncacn_np:\\\\<Server_Name>

   SendGenericMessage RPC on binding
   b1c7c350-c091-11cf-a65e-0020afc28c52@ncacn_np:\\\\<Server_Name>
   returned error: 0x5 (Access is denied.)

   SendGenericMessage RPC Layer returned error 0x5 (Access is denied.) This may
   happen if host security is not installed or the user account the service is
   running under, is not privileged to send messages to the remote end.
