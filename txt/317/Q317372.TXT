SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message on a blue screen in Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition:

   STOP 0x00000050 (0xa4032000, 0x00000001, 0x00000000, 0xc02900c8)

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs if the data value for the AppInit_Dlls value in the
following registry key contains more than 32 characters:

This situation is not handled by Win32k.sys properly and causes the pool to

WORKAROUND
==========

You can apply the hotfix, or you can use the Ln.exe tool from the Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit to create "hard" links with shorter names to the
DLLs that are listed in the AppInit_Dlls value. Place the "hard" links in the
same folder as the original DLLs. Then, change the AppInit_Dlls value to use
your new "hard" links with short names. You can leave the file extension off
when you change the AppInit_Dlls value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
