   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click the Modems icon in Control Panel, the hourglass symbol may
briefly appear, but the Modems Properties dialog box does not open.

You may also notice the following event in the Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 7028

   Description:
   The Control Registry key denied access to the system account program, so the
   service control manager took ownership of the key.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps.

NOTE: After you perform this procedure, you may need to reinstall your modem.

1. Log on to the computer as Administrator.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click Ports, and then delete all Component Object Model (COM) ports in
   the Ports list. To do this, select a COM port in the Ports list, and then
   click Delete. Click OK to confirm the removal of the port. When all COM ports
   have been deleted, click Close.

4. Quit Control Panel.

5. Click Start, and then click Run.

6. In the Open box, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click OK.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

7. In Registry Editor, click anywhere in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE on Local Machine
   window.

8. Navigate to the following registry subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Modem\Enum

9. Note the name of the modem key in the right pane of the Registry Editor
   window. The modem key name is next to Root and is in the following format,
   where <modem_key> is the name of the modem key:

   Root\<modem_key>\0000

   For example, the modem key for a generic 28.8-kilobits-per-second (Kbps) modem
   (MDMGEN288) is displayed as follows:

   0:REG_SZ:Root\MDMGEN288\0000
   Count:REG_DWORD:0X1
   NextInstance:REG_DWORD:0X1

10. Navigate to the following registry subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum

11. On the Security menu, click Owner.

12. Ensure that Enum is displayed next to Registry Key, and then click Take
   Ownership.

13. On the Security menu, click Permissions.

14. In the Name list, click Everyone.

15. In the "Type of Access" list, click Full Control.

16. Click to select the "Replace Permissions on Existing Subkeys" check box, and
   then click OK.

17. In the "Do you want to replace the permission on all existing subkeys within
   Enum?" dialog box that appears, click Yes.

18. Under the Enum subkey, double-click Root.

19. Under the Root subkey, click the key with the name that you noted in step 9.
   For example, if you noted MDMGEN288 in step 9, click the MDMGEN288 key that
   is displayed under the Root subkey.

20. On the Registry menu, click Save Key.

21. In the "File name" box, type "saved modem key" (without the quotation
   marks), and then click Save.

   NOTE: You can restore this registry subkey by double-clicking the "saved
   modem key.reg" file that you created.

22. On the Edit menu, click Delete, and then click Yes to confirm the deletion.

23. On the Registry menu, click Exit.

24. Restart the computer.
