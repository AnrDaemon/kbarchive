SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Contains query to query for data in a Database Results Region, an
error message similar to one of the following appears:

If you are using a Microsoft Access database

   Database Results Error
   Description: [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver] Syntax error (missing
   operator) in query expression '(FieldName LIKE '%test's%')'.
   Number: -2147217900 (0x80040E14)
   Source: Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers

If you are using a Microsoft SQL Server database

   Database Results Error
   Description: [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Line 1: Incorrect
   syntax near 's'.
   Number: -2147217900 (0x80040E14)
   Source: Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers

CAUSE
=====

The criteria you used in the query contains an apostrophe ('). The database
engine interprets the apostrophe to mean the end of the search text.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the Dynamic HTML sample in the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base artice:

   Q317924 HOW TO: Use DHTML to Add Wildcards to a Database Query

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FrontPage database library routines for reserved characters, such as an
apostrophe, do not parse queries that use Contains criteria but do parse queries
that use Like criteria. Queries using contains criteria are not parsed by the
FrontPage database library routines for reserved characters, such as an
apostrophe, although queries using Like criteria are. Queries using Contains
criteria are wrapped in wildcard characters. This allows searching for the
specified criteria anywhere within the database field. Queries using Like
criteria are parsed for reserved characters. These characters are converted to
escape sequences, and then compared exactly with the database.

A query using Like criteria can function as a Contains query. To achieve this
functionality, simply enclose the search text inside percent signs (%), like
this:

   %My Search Text%
