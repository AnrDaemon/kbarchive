TITLE   :PRB: Incorrect Time and Date in .resx File Added from VS .NET
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSExplorer kbDSupport kbGrpDSSSafe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 6.0c, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET (2002), Professional Edition 
    - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET (2002), Enterprise Architect Edition 
    - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET (2002), Enterprise Developer Edition 
    - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET (2002), Academic Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An incorrect time and date stamp appear in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer for a
.resx file that is added from Visual Studio .NET.

CAUSE
=====

The .resx file is copied from a template, which may have an earlier date. The
last modification date appears in Solution Explorer, instead of the current time
stamp.

RESOLUTION
==========

Visual SourceSafe updates the date during the next modification:

1. Check out the file (the default name of the file is UserControl1.cs).

2. Modify the file, and then check in the file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

1. Create a control library.

2. Add the project to Visual SourceSafe.

3. In Visual SourceSafe Explorer, note the date that is associated with the
   .resx file.
