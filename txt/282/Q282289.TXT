======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0-based site, you
may receive an error message that indicates the Setup program had been unable to
create an SMS account. When you examine the SMSSetup.log file in the root of the
drive where SMS is being installed, you may observe the following log entry:

   Setup cannot create account SMSServer_ABC in domain <Mydomain>. Contact
   your network administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the password that SMS attempts to create does not
pass the password complexity requirements that are in use in the domain.

By default, SMS creates accounts with random passwords that are at least 14
characters long that use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers,
and special characters.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, temporarily disable the password restrictions that
are configured in the domain, or any third-party password security programs that
are running in the domain.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
