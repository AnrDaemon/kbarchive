SUMMARY
=======

The DEACTIVATE_SESSION verb requests SNA Server or Host Integration Server (HIS)
2000 to deactivate a particular Advanced Program-to-Program Communications
(APPC) session between the local APPC Logical Unit (LU) and a specified partner
APPC LU, or all active sessions on a particular mode. To indicate that all of
the active sessions for a specified partner APPC LU and APPC mode should be
deactivated, the session_id parameter should be set to 8 binary zeros (00000000)
in the DEACTIVATE_SESSION verb.

If an APPC application issues a DEACTIVATE_SESSION verb to deactivate all of the
active sessions when there are no active sessions, the verb completes with the
following error message:

   Primary Return Code: AP_PARAMETER_CHECK
   Secondary Return Code: AP_INVALID_SESSION_ID

This behavior is by design because the session_id is invalid if there are no
active sessions to deactivate.

Other SNA platforms don't return an error when a DEACTIVATE_SESSION verb is
issued under the same scenario; the other SNA platforms return a primary return
code of OK in this situation.

This behavior of SNA Server has been modified so that the DEACTIVATE_SESSION verb
returns with a primary return code of OK when it tries to deactivate all active
sessions for a given partner LU/mode even if there are no active sessions at the
time.

Please refer to the APPC Programmer's Guide in the SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 2
(SP2) (or later) or Host Integration Server 2000 Software Development Kit (SDK)
for more information on the DEACTIVATE_SESSION verb.
