======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Web site application has been configured for Delegation security in the
Component Services management tool, and the Web site is configured for Basic
authentication, you may receive the following error message when you try to call
or create an out-of-process component that is on the same computer as Internet
Information Server (IIS):

   Error Type: Server object, ASP 0177 (0x800706D5) 800706d5
   /page.asp, line 3

NOTE: Error 0x800706D5 is "The security context is invalid".

CAUSE
=====

The user token that is generated from Basic authentication has the
SecurityImpersonation impersonation level instead of the SecurityDelegation
impersonation level.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use Integrated Security (using Kerberos).
