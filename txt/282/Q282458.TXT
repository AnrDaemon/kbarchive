KEYWORDS:kbSysAdmin kbWin2000sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A News Reader client may receive "502 Access Denied" error messages when
attempting to view the contents of a folder for which they have permissions to
view.

CAUSE
=====

The NNTP folder contains a large number of security descriptors for users who
have permissions to view the contents of this folder. The buffer that is set
aside to hold these security descriptors is not large enough to hold all the
descriptors, and therefore, none of the security descriptors are retrieved.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create nested groups that contains more groups and
individuals. This will reduce the size of immediate permissions on the folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Internet Information Services
5.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows 2000 Service Pack 3.
