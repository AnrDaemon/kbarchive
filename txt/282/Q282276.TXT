TITLE   :SMS: Deleting Numerous Ads Causes Delay in Offer Mgr Processing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMMC kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbAdvertisement kbSoftwareDist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you delete a large number of advertisements, subsequent offers of new
advertisements may be slow. In addition, new computers may be slow to receive
advertisements after joining a collection if the previous advertisement was
deleted.

CAUSE
=====

When you delete advertisements, Offer Manager creates a .del file for each
advertisement to be deleted. When processing a .del file, Offer Manager opens
and possibly modifies all .ins files on the site. Given a large site with many
clients, and many .ins files, this process can cause a lot of disk input/output,
and Offer Manager may be very slow to process the changes.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, delete only a small number of advertisements at a
time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
