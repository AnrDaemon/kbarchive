TITLE   :PRB: Wrong Path When You Connect to Database on Novell Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 6.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open a Visual SourceSafe database that is located on a Novell
Netware server, you may receive the following error message:

   Path does not exist

When you use a drive that is mapped to a share on a Novell server, Visual
SourceSafe may not resolve the path correctly. For example, if drive T maps to
the \\Server\Share\Directory\VSS share, Visual SourceSafe tries to use the
\\Server\Share\VSS share and returns the error message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because incomplete path information is returned to the Open
SourceSafe Database dialog box. This is a known problem with Novell.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use a mapped drive that is mapped only to a
\\Server\Share path. Do not add additional path information.

WORKAROUND
----------

To work around this problem, manually type the path to the Srcsafe.ini file for
the database in the Open SourceSafe Database dialog box. Do not click Browse in
this dialog box to locate the Srcsafe.ini file.

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

1. Install Visual SourceSafe on a computer.

2. Use the Admin program to create a user.

3. Open Visual SourceSafe Explorer, and then log on as the new user.

4. Create a project in Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

5. Copy all of the VSS directory (the directory that includes the Srcsafe.ini
   file) to a directory on the server. By default, the VSS directory is located
   in the following directory:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\VSS

6. Map a drive to the Common directory on the server that you copied the VSS
   directory to in step 4.

7. In Visual SourceSafe Explorer, click Open SourceSafe Database on the File
   menu.

8. In the Open SourceSafe Database dialog box, click Browse.

9. In the Look In box, click the mapped drive, and then locate the Srcsafe.ini
   file in the VSS directory on the server. Notice that the database does not
   open and that you receive the error message that is listed in the "Symptoms"
   section.
