SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to create a new key request by using Key Manager, you may
receive the following error message:

   Unable to generate a new key request

CAUSE
=====

One or more of the fields of the key request may contain an invalid character,
such as a comma (,), a single quotation mark ('), or a quotation mark (").

RESOLUTION
==========

Use only the letters A-Z and the numbers 0-9 as characters in the fields of the
request. You may use periods (.) in the common name to specify a fully qualified
domain name (FQDN).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Service Packs earlier than Service Pack 6 allow you to enter invalid characters
in the fields of the request. In Service Pack 6 and later, Key Manager prevents
you from entering invalid characters.
