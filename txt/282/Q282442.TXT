TITLE   :XADM: Error Message Occurs When You Run Offline Defragmentation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.5

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an offline defragmentation command for a database that is larger
than 96 gigabytes (GB), you may receive an error message.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because Windows NT Server 4.0 has a copy limitation of 96
GB. If you exceed this limit, Windows NT Server 4.0 cannot finish copying
Tempdfrg.edb back to Priv.edb.

   Q259837 You May Not Be Able to Copy Large Files on Computers That Are Running
   Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Start a command prompt, navigate to the Exchsrvr\Bin folder, and then run the
   following command:

   eseutil /d /ispriv /p

When you run this command, a Tempdfrg.edb database is created in the Exchsrvr\Bin
folder. This database is a more compact version of Priv.edb.

NOTE: To create the new Tempdrfg.edb file, the free space on this drive must be
equal to the size of your Priv.edb file, for example, if your Priv.edb file is
100 GB, you need an extra 100 GB of free space.

2. At this point, Priv.edb and Tempdfrg.edb exist in the same folder. Move
   Priv.edb to another location or back it up.

3. Rename Tempdfrg.edb to Priv.edb, and then start the Information Store
   service.

WORKAROUND
==========

If there is no space on the current hard disk, you can create Tempdfrg.edb in a
Temp folder, and then use Esefile.exe to copy the file back to the original
folder. To do so, use the workaround described in this section.

NOTE: Esefile.exe does not use the Windows NT 4.0 copyFile() API call.

1. Start a command prompt, navigate to the Exchsrvr\Bin folder, and then run the
   following command, where <x> is the drive letter:

   eseutil /d /ispriv /t<x>:\<temp_folder_path>\tempdfrg.edb /p

NOTE: You may not need to type <temp_folder_path> if you are placing this
file in the root of a drive. You need to name the database, but you do not have
to name it "Tempdfrg.edb".

2. Use the Esefile.exe utility that is located in the Eng\Server\Support\Esefile
   folder on the Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 (SP3) CD-ROM to copy the
   Tempdfrg.edb file back to the original Mdbdata folder. For example:

   esefile /c <source_path><destination_path>

NOTE: In this example, <source_path> is
<X>:\<Temp_folder_path>\Tempdfrg.edb (you must include the file
name), and <destination_path> is Y:\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata\Priv.edb (you must
include the file name).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
