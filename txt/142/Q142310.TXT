The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

If a print device is temporarily out of service or it is not available for an
extended period of time, print jobs that are submitted to the printer are on
hold. Windows NT does not include a feature that automatically redirects print
jobs to another printer of the same type. This article explains how you can
redirect print jobs to another printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To redirect print jobs of a specific printer, do one of the following:

 - If Windows NT recognizes either a local or network printer, change the Print
   To entry in Print Manager to the new printer.

   -or-

 - If Windows NT does not recognize a network printer, but you do know the share
   name of the network printer, type the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt:

   "net use LPTx: \\<Computer name>\<Printer name>" (without the
   quotation marks)

   In Print Manager, change the Print To entry to the redirected port LPTx (where
   x is the printer port number).
