-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 1.0, 1.05, 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 2.5, 2.6 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send e-mail using MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may receive a
non-delivery receipt with the following message:

   No transport provider was available for delivery to this recipient.

CAUSE
=====

This error has four possible causes:

 - You do not have The Microsoft Network Online Service in your e-mail profile.
   To check your profile, double-click Mail And Fax in Control Panel.

 - You replied to e-mail that has an address not found in the MSN address book
   and that is not an Internet address. This problem occurs when the sender
   includes an address that is available on the sender's mail system but not on
   MSN.

 - The service provider is not loaded. To check this, follow these steps:

   

   1. In Microsoft Exchange, click Services on the Tools menu, and then click MSN.

   2. Now click About. You should then see the following files in the File Names
   box:

   

 - Mosrxp32.dll

 - Mosabp32.dll

 - Moscfg32.dll

 - The addressee's mail server is unable to accept the message because the
   server is down or blocked when the mail message is being distributed.

 - The profile in Outlook 97 is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, use the appropriate method:

 - If The Microsoft Network Online Service is not in your profile, double-click
   Mail and Fax in Control Panel, click Add, and then add the service.

 - All addresses must either be in the MSN address book or be valid Internet
   addresses. You cannot send replies to addresses that exist only on the
   sender's mail system.

 - If the service provider is not loaded (i.e., you do not see three file names
   when you check the service provider), remove and reinstall Microsoft Exchange
   and MSN using these steps:

   

   1. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs, click the Windows Setup
   tab, and then click the Microsoft Exchange and MSN check boxes to clear them.

   2. Click OK, and then restart your computer.

   3. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs, click the Windows Setup
   tab, and then click the Microsoft Exchange and MSN check boxes to select
   them.

   4. Click OK, and then restart your computer.

 - If the receiving mail server was down, send the message again when the server
   is working properly.

 - If using Outlook 97, create a new profile using a different name for the
   *.pst and *.pab files.
