TITLE   :PRB: Path Problems on Client Installation of SourceSafe
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It may appear that certain configurable items are not working properly.

CAUSE
=====

The Srcsafe.ini file contains a reference to a local drive when the network
address is the intended entry.

RESOLUTION
==========

The path to the shadow directory should be made using Universal Naming
Conventions (UNC) to prevent confusion when using Visual SourceSafe from another
computer located on the network. If, for example, the shadow directory is set
via the SSADMIN program on the server to D:\ssafe\shadow on the server's local D
drive, each workstation will attempt to locate its own D:\ssafe\shadow
directory, which may not exist. Changing the path to the correct UNC (for
example \\myserver\myshare\shadow) will work correctly from the server and all
workstations.

NOTE: This problem and resolution also applies to the Journal file setting.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. From a computer that is being used as a network location for the Visual
   SourceSafe data, use the Ssadmin.exe program.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click Shadow Directories. Set the
   project to Shadow to $/ and select a directory by using the Browse button.
