The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft 3D Movie Maker for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker for Windows, version 1.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play a movie that has a Credits Box (scrolling text), other movie
animation pauses and movie frames do not advance until the text in the box
finishes scrolling.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Three-D objects (such as actors, props, and 3D words) and Words (Credits Boxes
and Story Boxes) behave differently. While 3D objects can move simultaneously
and Word Boxes can move simultaneously, the two types of objects cannot move at
the same time.

For example, you can have several Actors, Props, and 3D Words animating at the
same time, or you can have several Credits Boxes animating at the same time.
However, you cannot have an Actor and Credits Box animating at the same time.

Any blank lines preceding or following the main text in a Credits Box are treated
as lines of text and cause the Credits Box to continue to scroll.
