TITLE   :Windows NT 4.0 Not Able to Read Some Compact Discs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to read or copy files from certain compact discs to your hard
drive, you get the following error message:

   Cannot copy <filename>: Error performing inpage operation.

The same files could be copied by earlier versions of Windows NT, or by other
operating systems, and other compact discs work correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by the compact disc file system (CDFS) not quite correctly
recognizing the allocation size of a file on media of a block size different
than the physical sector size of 2048 on a compact disc (for example, less than
indicated per ISO 9660). CDFS tries to generate sector- aligned reads regardless
of whether it is doing that reading beyond the mapped range of the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

The fixed version of CDFS.sys is available in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 or
later.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.00. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
