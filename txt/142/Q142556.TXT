SUMMARY
=======

This article provides information on testing a default installation of the
Microsoft Internet Information Server W3 Service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default installation of the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)
contains sample files that can be used to test the functionality of your IIS WWW
publication service.

To test your server on the local LAN:

 - Ensure your computer has an active connection to your local LAN and that your
   name resolution is working properly.

 - Make sure the WWW service is started by opening Microsoft Internet Service
   Manager and verifying State is "Running".

 - Start the Microsoft Internet Explorer.

 - Click on File, Open or use the File Open icon on the toolbar.

 - Type in the Uniform Resource Location (URL) for the home directory of your
   new server. The URL will be "http://" followed by the NetBIOS name of your
   server. For example if your server is called, "myserver" you would type:

   http://myserver

 - You should see a sample HTML page. If not you may be publishing from a
   previous installation directory. In that case use the full path to access the
   sample page such as:

   http://myserver/samples
