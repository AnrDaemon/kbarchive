TITLE   :Upgrade from Uni- to Multiprocessor (Uptomp.exe) and Win32k.sys
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbhw kbsetup kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade a single processor computer with Windows NT 4.0 installed to a
multiprocessor system, several files have to be changed.

The affected files are:

   Ntoskrnl.exe (Ntkrnlmp.exe has to be copied and renamed to Ntoskrnl.exe)
   Hal.dll (System specific Hal*.dll has to copied and renamed to Hal.dll)
   Kernel32.dll
   Ntdll.dll
   Winsrv.dll
   Win32k.sys (New for Windows NT 4.0)

CAUSE
=====

Although Uptomp.exe from the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit does assist to copy the
correct files, Win32k.sys is not copied with this utility.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem:

1. Locate the file Win32k.sys on the Windows NT 4.0 compact disc, and copy it to
   the System32 directory.

   NOTE: The file might be compressed as Win32k.sy_. Use Expand.exe to uncompress
   the file.

   You must then modify the %systemroot%\repair\setup.log file to modify the CRC
   value of win32k.sys to equal 13e42a - this value is for the multi-processor
   version and is used when installing future service packs or repairing the
   system files.

   NOTE: If the customer already has a Service Pack loaded on the system he
   should point to the Service pack directory when the utility asks him for a
   path for the replacement files.

2. Modify the Resource Kit Uptomp.inf file and add the Win32k.sys to the list of
   files as follows:

   hal.dll = 1, 2, hal.dll
   ntoskrnl.exe = 0, 2, ntkrnlmp.exe
   ntdll.dll = 0, 2, ntdll.dll
   kernel32.dll = 0, 2, kernel32.dll
   winsrv.dll = 0, 2, winsrv.dll
   win32k.sys = 0, 2, win32k.sys
