PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your computer, you may receive the following error message:

   Windows protection error. You need to restart your computer.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if IP routing is enabled. IP routing is not a supported
feature of Windows 95.


RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

Use Registry Editor to remove the EnableRouting value from the following registry
key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP

Also, remove the "EnableRouting=1" entry if it is present in the [MSTCP] section
of the System.ini file.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is likely to occur if you upgraded a Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups-based computer using the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 protocol with IP routing
enabled to Windows 95. In this situation, the "EnableRouting=1" entry is present
in the System.ini file and is copied to the registry during the upgrade
process.

IP routing is not enabled by default in Windows 95, and can be enabled only by
adding the unsupported EnableRouting value to the registry.
