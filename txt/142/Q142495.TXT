                                  code for the article named "Programming
                                  Windows 95 with MFC, Part VII: The
                                  Document/View Architecture," by Jeff
                                  Prosise.

                                  The document/view architecture of
                                  Visual C++ 4.0 really simplifies
                                  the development process. Code to
                                  perform routine chores is provided
                                  by the framework. So is code to
                                  transform your app's documents into
                                  OLE container, simplify printing, and
                                  more.

S15729      WEBSTER.EXE           The WEBSTER.EXE file contains the source
                                  code for the article named "Write a
                                  Simple HTTP-based Server Using MFC and
                                  Windows Sockets," by David Cook.

                                  You may be surprised at how easy it is
                                  to write a World Wide Web server. Our
                                  sample server, Webster, is without
                                  question a bare-bones "baby" server,
                                  but it does demonstrate some of the
                                  basic techniques of Internet
                                  programming.

                                  with DirectSound and DirectImput" by
                                  Dave Edson.

                                  DirectSound ensures that you'll get
                                  swell audio with wave mixing from
                                  your games, while DirectInput is a
                                  much needed standard for handling
                                  the joystick. Both are components of
                                  the new Game SDK for Windows 95.
