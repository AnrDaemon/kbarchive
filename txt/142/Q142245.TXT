-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Setup program of Visual Basic from a network or CD-ROM drive,
you might get the following error message:

   Unable to Start DDE Communication with Program Manager.

This behavior occurs when the Setup program is creating the Start menu items.
This error message may appear if Visual Basic is installed from a network CD-ROM
drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

Start the DDE service before starting the Setup program of Visual Basic. To
accomplish this behavior:

1. Close all applications and folders.

2. From the Start menu, click Run. Enter "c:\windows\netdde.exe" in the Open
   combo box and click OK.

3. Verify that netdde.exe is running in the background. Press CTRL-ALT-DELETE to
   display the task manager. Netdde should be one of the entries in the list.

4. Run the Setup program of Visual Basic.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
