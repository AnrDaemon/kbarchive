KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork win95kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Windows-based version of a Novell NetWare program that attempts
to map a path to a NetWare server with a backslash (\) at the end of the path,
the connection may not be made or you may receive an error message stating that
the server could not be found.

This problem may also occur with the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory
Services (MSNDS).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Ifsmgr.vxd file does not support a trailing
backslash on a network connection.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
