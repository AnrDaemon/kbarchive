SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Internet Information Server SMTP connectivity can be tested with the
TELNET utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information on how to test the TCP layer of the connection,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q115492 : SMTP: Troubleshooting the TCP/IP Layer of the Mail Gateway

Use the TELNET command with a "25" after the host ID or IP address to specify the
mail socket. Run the TELNET command from the gateway PC to the host, and from
the host to the gateway PC. For example:

   TELNET tcpiphost.company.com 25
   TELNET msmailgwy.company.com 25

NOTE: You cannot run the second command unless the gateway is running.

If these commands are successful, you will receive the response "220...." from
the destination host. Successful completion means the TCP layer is working. Type
QUIT to end the test.
