======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 96 World Atlas for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to set up a printer or print a map from the World Atlas, you
receive one of the following error messages:

   Encarta '96 World Atlas is unable to continue running. The problem may be the
   result of low system resources such as memory or disk space. Try closing
   other running applications or freeing up disk space before restarting World
   Atlas.

   MSWORLD caused an invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL

When you click OK, the program closes. The problem occurs when the default
printer is a Windows 3.x driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install a Windows 95/98 printer driver. To install a Windows 95/98 printer
driver, do the following:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Double click the Add Printer icon, and then follow the steps in the Add
   Printer Wizard to install a driver for your printer.

3. When you are prompted, set the new printer as default.

4. Print the test page to confirm the printer driver is version 4.0 or later.

5. When the Add Printer Wizard is finished, delete the old printer icon.

No Windows 95/98 Printer Driver
-------------------------------

If a Windows 95/98 printer driver isn't available for your printer, just make
sure the Windows 3.x driver is not set as the default printer. When you print,
though, you can select the Windows 3.x printer driver and print without any
problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about your printer, supported drivers and emulation modes,
please refer to your printer documentation.
