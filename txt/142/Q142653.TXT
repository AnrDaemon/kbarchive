TITLE   :STOP Message Occurs Calling GetThreadContext/SetThreadContext
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you run a program that calls to GetThreadContext() or SetThreadContext() with
certain bad kernel mode addresses (high bit set) specified for the context
recorn, a Stop message with a blue screen appears and your computer stops
responding (hangs).

The stop code is a function of the type of illegal address passed to the
function.

CAUSE
=====

A field in the context structure is referenced within a try/except, but without
first doing a probe.

Almost all bad kernel addresses are caught by the exception handling mechanism,
but there are classes of addresses which the system declares as totally invalid
and which should never generate a fault. If one of these addresses is referenced
and a fault occurs, the system crashes on purpose.

WORKAROUND
==========

Obtain the fix mentioned below or wait for the next Service Pack.

To work around this problem, stop using the software that calls GetThreadContext
or SetThreadContext with the illegal address value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
