======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Focus notifications (EN_SETFOCUS, BN_SETFOCUS, and so on) for controls in a
CFormView are usually handled in the CFormView class. Calling a function that
relies on the window handle of the control (m_hWnd) inside such a handler may
cause an assertion failure in Afxwin2.inl. This happens only if the control is
the first one in the tab order.

CAUSE
=====

The assertion failure occurs because the focus handler for the control is being
called before OnInitialUpdate() is called for the CFormView.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, make sure that the m_hWnd member of the control is
not NULL before calling any function that relies on it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 4.1.

Sample Code
-----------

The following illustrates calling SetSel in the for an Edit control.

       void CSettestView::OnSetFocusEdit1()
       {
           if(NULL != m_Edit.m_hWnd)
               m_Edit.SetSel( 0,1 );
       }
