TITLE   :WOW: GP Fault in Ddeml.dll Using Visual Basic Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbProgramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

16-bit Windows Visual Basic applications using dynamic data exchange (DDE) for
inter-process communications may return a general protection fault (GPF) under
Windows NT 3.51.

This problem only occurs using Windows NT 3.51; the application does not fail
using Windows NT 3.1 or 3.5

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 3.51 added error detection code to Ddeml.dll to validate DDE data
structures. Applications that previously were successful may now fail with a GPF
when passing invalid DDEDATA to DdeFreeDataHandle.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
