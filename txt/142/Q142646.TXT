TITLE   :Upgrading to SP4 Can Overwrite Newer Verions of Oleaut32.dll
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply Service Packs 1 through 4, a newer version of Oleaut32.dll is
overwritten with an old one. For example, you install a new version of Microsoft
Office, which updates Oleaut32.dll to a newer version. When you then apply
Service Pack 4 (SP4), the new Oleaut32.dll is replaced with the older SP4
version, dated 1/4/96, version 2.1, size 233,232 bytes.

Once this file is overwritten, the resulting behavior for Office will be frequent
application crashes or various unexpected or unexplainable errors.

CAUSE
=====

Date checking was not enabled in the Update.inf for this file, so the Service
Pack overwrites a newer version without checking. The update utility replaces
the newer version of Oleaut32.dll with an old version and the applications that
rely on functionality in the newer file fail to run correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the fix referenced below. The Update.inf
included with the fix contains a change specifying OVERWRITE=OLDER for
Oleaut32.dll. With this change to Update.inf, only a newer version of
Oleaut32.dll will be applied.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, replace Oleaut32.dll with the newer version from
the application with which you are having problems. The version of Oleaut32.dll
that is installed by Windows NT Service Pack 4 is dated 1/4/96.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 Service
Pack 1 through 4.This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
