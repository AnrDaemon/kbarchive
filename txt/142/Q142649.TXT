TITLE   :STOP 0x0000000A on ALR Revolution
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

ALR Revolution Quad P6 systems running Windows NT 3.51, and possibly other
systems from other manufacturers, may experience the following kernel mode stop
error message:

   STOP 0x0000000A

CAUSE
=====

This is due to a problem with Ntfs.sys. During a particular kind of internal
operation involved in extending a file, the Windows NT File System (NTFS) thread
that is performing the extension must have exclusive access to certain internal
data structures. The thread may or may not already have exclusive ownership of
the resources before it begins this function, and should only release the
resources after performing the extension if it did not already own the
resources. The STOP 0x0000000A is caused by the NTFS thread releasing the
resources before it should, allowing other thread(s) an opportunity to interfere
with the work it is doing.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
