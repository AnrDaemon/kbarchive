SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to temporarily disable password caching when you are
using the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS). Disabling
password caching ensures that your password remains secure when other users use
your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To temporarily disable password caching when you are using MSNDS, use one of the
following methods:

 - To disable password caching when the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks is
   your primary network client, or when the Microsoft Client for NetWare
   Networks is not your primary network client but the pass- word for your
   primary network client is null, press and hold down the CTRL key when the
   Windows 95 logo is displayed. When the first Enter Network Password or
   Welcome To Windows dialog box is displayed, release the CTRL key.

 - To disable password caching when the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks is
   not your primary network client and the password for your primary network
   client is not null, press and hold down the CTRL key while you click OK in
   the first Enter Network Password or Welcome To Windows dialog box. When the
   next Enter Network Password or Welcome to Windows dialog box is displayed,
   release the CTRL key.
