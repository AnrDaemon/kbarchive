TITLE   :Send Command from 32-Bit Program Starts Only MS Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:win95

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Send command in a 32-bit program such as WordPad, one of the
following behaviors may occur:

 - If Microsoft Exchange is installed and configured, Microsoft Exchange starts
   instead of any installed 16-bit mail program.

 - If Microsoft Exchange is not installed, the 16-bit mail program stops
   responding (hangs).

 - If Microsoft Exchange is installed but not configured, the Microsoft Exchange
   Setup Wizard starts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Send command is a function of Simple MAPI. All 32-bit programs call
Mapi32.dll to use Simple MAPI. Mapi32.dll is a Windows 95 system file that is
installed even if Microsoft Exchange is not installed. Because Mapi32.dll calls
only a 32-bit mail program, Microsoft Exchange is started. It is not currently
possible for a 32-bit program to perform a Send function to a 16-bit mail
program.
