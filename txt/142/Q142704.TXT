TITLE   :Windows NT Mail Client Does Not Handle Long Filenames Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attach files with long filenames including spaces (for example: "This
is a long name.txt") from the Windows NT mail client, they appear to attach
correctly, but when you try to open them you receive the error, "No application
is associated with file name."

NOTE: Long file names without spaces (for example: "Thisisalongname.txt") work
correctly.

The same problem happens when you try to Save Attachment. The dialog box offers
you the complete filename of the attached file, but it does not allow you to
save it with this name.

CAUSE
=====

Opening the files causes them to be saved to TEMP directory in the following
format:

   "This is a small file.txt" becomes  "thisisas"
   "Thisismylongfilename.txt" becomes  "thisismy.txt"

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
