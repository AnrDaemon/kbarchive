TITLE   :Problems Installing SRAM or Flash Memory Cards in Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a PCMCIA SRAM or Flash memory card into a Windows 95- based
computer that has been configured to use protected-mode PCMCIA card drivers,
there may be no drive letter in My Computer or Windows Explorer associated with
the PCMCIA card. This can occur even though the card seems to be recognized
properly and the appropriate driver is installed.

CAUSE
=====

PCMCIA SRAM and Flash memory cards must be installed differently than other
cards that use Windows 95 protected-mode drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

SRAM Cards
----------

To install a PCMCIA SRAM card in Windows 95, the following two entries must be
placed in the Config.sys file

   device=c:\<windows>\system\csmapper.sys
   device=c:\<windows>\system\carddrv.exe /slot=<x>

where <windows> is the Windows folder and <x> indicates the number of
PCMCIA card slots in the computer.

Flash Cards
-----------

To install a PCMCIA Flash memory card in Windows 95, the following entries must
be placed in the Config.sys file

   device=c:\<windows>\system\csmapper.sys
   device=c:\<windows>\system\carddrv.exe /slot=<x>
   device=c:\<windows>\ms-flash.sys

where <windows> is the Windows folder and <x> indicates the number of
PCMCIA slots in the computer.

NOTE: The Ms-flash.sys file is not included with Windows 95. This file must be
provided by the Flash memory card manufacturer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The information in this article applies only to installing SRAM and Flash memory
cards. You may still need to partition and format such cards according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Please see the documentation provided by the
manufacturer.

Note that if you use only protected-mode drivers for these cards, you do not have
access to the cards if you boot your computer to a command prompt.
