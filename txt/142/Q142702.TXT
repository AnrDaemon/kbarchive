TITLE   :IIS Err Msg: Authentication Is Required For This Document
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message appears on a Microsoft Internet Explorer client:

   Error: Authentication is required for this document. The server did not
   specify a supported authentication method."

CAUSE
=====

A potential cause can be that you have set the Password Authentication on the
Microsoft Internet Information Server to a level that is not supported on your
Explorer client. The Windows NT Internet Explorer 1.5 Client will only support
Anonymous and Basic Authentication.

RESOLUTION
==========

Currently, only Internet Explorer 2.0 for Windows 95 supports Challenge/Response
Authentication. Run INSTALL.BAT from the Internet Information Server's
\CLIENTS\WIN95 directory to install Internet Explorer and the authentication
module.

If Internet Explorer is not installed in the above manner, manually add the
authentication module by running IENTLM.EXE from the \CLIENTS\WIN95 directory.
