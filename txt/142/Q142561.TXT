SYMPTOMS
========

The following error appears when you query an ODBC data source from Internet
Information Server (IIS):

   [State=IM003][Error=0][Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Specified driver
   could not be loaded

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the ODBC driver (SQLSRV32.DLL in this case) specified
by your DSN is not in the path which is listed in the ODBC.INI file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the ODBC driver path specified by your DSN in the ODBC.INI file and
correct it. Below is an excerpt from an ODBC.INI file:

      [ODBC 32 bit Data Sources]
      YourDSNname=SQL Server (32 bit)

      [YourDSNname]
      Driver32=D:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\sqlsrv32.dll
