KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork kbpolicy win95kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 may stop responding (hang) with different results on different
Computers when you try to install a network protocol that uses the TDI
interface.

This problem occurs only if the Microsoft TCP/IP protocol is already installed
when you try to add the other protocol, or when you try to add the Microsoft
TCP/IP protocol after installing another protocol that uses the TDI interface.

CAUSE
=====

The TDI interface provider (Vtdi.386) included with Windows 95 supports only one
protocol using that interface. The TCP/IP protocol included with Windows 95 uses
the TDI interface, causing a conflict if you install an additional protocol that
uses the TDI interface.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
