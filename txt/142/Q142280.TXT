TITLE   :PPT7: Fonts in Font List Contain Question Marks
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbdta kbFont kbPrinting

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose a font from the font list in PowerPoint, only a limited number
of fonts may be listed, and those listed may have a question mark in front of
each name instead of a TrueType symbol.

You may also find that regardless of the font or text size you choose, your text
may appear very small and/or jagged.

CAUSE
=====

This can be caused by any one of the following:

 - You do not have a printer driver installed in Windows 95.

 - Your current default printer is set to Generic/Text Only.

 - The current default printer driver is corrupt or damaged.

 - Your current default printer is using a Windows 3.x printer driver.

 - Your default printer is a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 500 and the printer
   resolution is currently set to 75dpi.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use the appropriate method for your situation:

 - If you have not installed a printer in Windows 95, do so to correct the
   problem.

 - If your default printer is set to Generic/Text only, set another printer as
   default.

 - If your default printer driver is damaged or corrupted, remove that driver
   and re-install it.

 - If your default printer is using a Windows 3.x driver, remove it and install
   the Windows 95 driver for that printer, or contact the manufacturer of your
   printer.

 - If your default printer is a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500, you can change the
   printer resolution to 150 dots-per-inch (dpi) or to 300 dpi, or you can set
   up a new default printer.
