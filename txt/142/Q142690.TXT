TITLE   :Windows NT Explorer Hangs With NEC CD-ROM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Windows NT Explorer, your computer may stop responding
(hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you are using a model of the NEC CD-ROM drive that
supports SCSI 2 and the Cdaudio service is enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, disable the Cdaudio service. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double- click
   Devices.

2. Click Cdaudio, and then click Startup.

3. Click Disabled, click OK, and then click Close.

4. Restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Cdaudio.sys driver attempts to detect non SCSI 2 devices at startup. This
detection is based on the Inquiry string of the device. Although earlier models
of the NEC CD-ROM drives require the Cdaudio.sys driver, newer models of the NEC
CD_ROM drives do not require the Cdaudio.sys driver.

Disabling the Cdaudio service on a computer with a model of the NEC CD-ROM drive
that supports SCSI 2 does not affect the functionality of the product.
