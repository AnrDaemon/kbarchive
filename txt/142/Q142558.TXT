TITLE   :Adding Mime Types to Internet Information Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Mime types allow files to be opened by "helper" applications on web browser
clients, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. Currently, mime types for Internet
Information Server (IIS) must be added manually to the registry. There is no
graphical interface for adding mime types at this time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IIS installs the most common mime types by default. Mime types for new
applications or applications that are not widely used will have to be added
manually. Note that a helper application may have to be configured on the client
as well. Mime entries can be added to the following registry location:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\InetInfo\Parameters\
MimeMap

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To add an entry, open the MimeMap key and choose Edit Value or Add Value.

The mime information needs to be placed in the Value Name box. The data type for
the entry should be set to REG_SZ, the string field should be left blank. The
following is an example of a mime entry:

   image/gif,gif,,5:REG_SZ:

   <mime/type>,<extension>,<unused>,<gopher item type>

The unused field is represented by an extra comma between 'gif' and '5'. The
extra comma must be included for the mime type to work correctly.

NOTE: Only the gopher server uses the Gopher item type. The gopher item types are
listed below. In the above example, the gopher item type '5' describes the file
type as an MS-DOS binary archive.
