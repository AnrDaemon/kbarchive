SUMMARY
=======

Under Windows NT 4.0 Workstation or Server, the base priority of the command
(CMD) process and of the thread that runs in it is set to 8 by default.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under Windows NT 3.x, the base priority of the CMD process and the thread that
runs in it used to be set to 7; the system could boost the thread from priority
7 to priority 9.

As previously stated, under Windows NT 4.0 the base priority of the CMD process
and the thread that runs it is now set to 8 by default. The system can still
boost the thread priority by 2 points, but now the increase is from priority 8
to priority 10.

To check this change, simply start a CMD process and start Performance Monitor.
Check the chart with Object: Process and Counter: Priority Base for the
Instance: CMD.

You can also check the chart with Object: Thread and Counter: Priority Base vs.
Counter: Priority Current for the Instance: CMD.
