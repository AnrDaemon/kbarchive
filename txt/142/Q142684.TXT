TITLE   :NetworkAddress Parameter Not Supported for a Modem
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Assigning a specific media access control address with the parameter

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NdisWAN\Parameters\ 
NetworkAddress

for the modem used for a RAS connection is not supported. Every time a RAS
connection is made, the assigned media access control address is set randomly.


CAUSE
=====

There are two reasons why assigning a specific media access control address is
not supported. The first reason is that a modem uses Serial.sys, and serial is
not a device that NetworkAddress is relative to. The second reason is that the
NetworkAddress registry override parameter is an optional value that is enforced
only for Token Ring. So, if Serial.sys supported the NetworkAddress parameter,
assigning a specific media access control address could be done. However, this
would get more complicated with multiple serial devices in a machine. So,
although a modem is a WAN device, it does not use a network device driver, which
is where the optional NetworkAddress registry override parameter would be
managed.
