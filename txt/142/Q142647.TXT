TITLE   :Callback Field for RAS May Not Be Viewable From Rasadmin.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you view a Windows NT 4.0 Remote Access Service (RAS) server from a Windows
NT 3.51 server, the callback field may not show the phone number correctly, or
you may not see a phone number at all.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT 4.0 RAS server has the capability to accept or call IP numbers,
NetBIOS names, and Domain Name Service (DNS) host names as well as phone
numbers. The Windows NT 3.51 Rasadmin executable file does not have this
capability.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
