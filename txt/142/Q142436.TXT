   MIME version 1.0

Microsoft Exchange Server Service Pack 2 has added support for:

   Resent-from:
   Content-type: multipart/appledouble
   Content-type: application/applefile
   Encoding: x-binhex

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an SMTP Host connects to the Microsoft Exchange IMC, there are certain
headers sent by the SMTP Host that the Microsoft Exchange IMC uses to determine
the actions to perform. The headers listed above are the headers that the
Microsoft Exchange IMC understands. If any other headers are received by the
Microsoft Exchange IMC, the message will be accepted and the unknown headers
will be ignored.

To save headers in the Microsoft Windows NT Event Log, start the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program, open the property page for the Microsoft
Exchange IMC, choose the Diagnostic Logging tab, and set the Logging level to
Maximum.
