SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print envelopes to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) 4/4M Plus printer
under Windows NT 4.0 using the 4/4M Plus Post Script drivers that ship with
Windows NT 4.0 and an HP envelope feeder unit, you receive the following error
message:

   ME feed COMM 10.

This means that the printer driver does not see that there is an envelope feeder
attached to the printer. Below is a list of the printer driver versions involved
with this problem:

   Driver Name:    Pscript.dll
   Data file:      Hp4plus6.ppd
   Config file:    Pscrptui.dll
   Driver version: 4.01
   Environment:    Windows NT x86

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the envelope feeder and feed the envelopes manually.

STATUS
======

Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
