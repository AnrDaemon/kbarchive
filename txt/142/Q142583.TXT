TITLE   :3D Movie Maker: Inserted Sound Doesn't Play

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft 3D Movie Maker for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to set a long sound to play in 3D Movie Maker, the sound does not
play.

For example, if you have a long sound that you want to start playing in frame 10,
and then you start your movie in frame 11, the sound does not play.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because 3D Movie Maker inserts a reference (pointer) to the sound
file in frame 10.

This is by design. Because 3D Movie Maker does not insert a piece of the sound
into each frame, you can easily change the movie without affecting the sounds.

RESOLUTION
==========

To play a sound in 3D Movie Maker, you need to start the movie before or at the
frame where you inserted the sound.
