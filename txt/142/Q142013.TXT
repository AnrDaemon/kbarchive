======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

SUMMARY
=======

BIOS revision 1.20 for the Adaptec 2940 is incompatible with systems using
Phoenix BIOS versions 4.04 and 4.05. This problem has been corrected in the
Adaptec 2940 BIOS revision 1.21 which is available from Adaptec.

BIOS revision 1.21 for the Adaptec 2940 is incompatible with systems using
Micronics motherboards with dual processors. Windows NT will load, but will only
show one processor. There have also been problems with this adapter and
motherboard combination when only one processor was present.


The simplest explanation given from Adaptec is that the Adaptec 2940 card is
interfering with the communication between NT and the motherboard's BIOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When using an Adaptec 2940 with BIOS revision 1.20 in a system using a Phoenix
BIOS version 4.04 or 4.05, your system may stop responding (hang) during
startup.

Usually the computer hangs after displaying the Adaptec BIOS information, but it
has also been reported to cause problems later in the setup process. This
behavior may also occur in systems containing a BIOS which utilizes segment
3000.

This problem has been corrected in the Adaptec 2940 BIOS revision 1.21 which is
available from Adaptec.
