TITLE   :FIX: RELEASE Releases All Local Variables with Identical Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the RELEASE <memvar> command is called to release a LOCAL variable,
all variables that have that same name are also released. For example, a local
variable that is declared in a higher level procedure and is not visible in the
current routine is released when the RELEASE <memvar> command is issued.

WORKAROUND
==========

Because local variables are out of scope as soon as you call another program,
you can avoid using the RELEASE command to explicitly release a local variable.

You can also use the RELEASE ALL command instead of RELEASE <memvar>. For
example, instead of using this:

      RELEASE lcMychar

use this:

      RELEASE ALL LIKE lcMychar

The RELEASE ALL command does not release local variables that have been declared
in other procedures or functions, even if they have the same name as a local
variable in the current procedure.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.
