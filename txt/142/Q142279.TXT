TITLE   :Semi-Transparent Fills Are Black on Printout (Canon BJC-610)
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbprint kbdta kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print an object with a semi-transparent fill from PowerPoint 95 to a
Canon BJC-610 printer, the object may appear black on the printout.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by the Canon BJC-610 printer driver. This driver is
shipped with the printer by Canon and is a Windows 3.1 driver. PowerPoint 95
uses some features new to Windows 95 to create semi- transparent fills. The
printer driver does not understand these printing commands and interprets the
semi-transparent fill as a black fill.

STATUS
======

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
