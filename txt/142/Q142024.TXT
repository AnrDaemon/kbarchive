SUMMARY
=======

When an RPC server application starts, it exports its characteristics to a
name-service provider. By default, Microsoft Locator is the default name-
service provider. The Microsoft RPC interoperates with any name-service provider
that follows the Microsoft RPC name-service interface (NSI) specification. For
example, the DCE Cell Directory Service is accessed through the DEC NSID. Any
RPC client that needs to access the RPC Server application can use the name
service provider to locate the server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you want to change the default Windows NT Name Service Provider to another
provider, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel Network, select the RPC Name Service Provider and choose
   Configure.

2. In the RPC Configuration dialog box, select the DCE Cell Directory Service.

3. For Network Address, enter the address of the NSI daemon (NSID) and choose
   OK. The NSID computer is a gateway for the DCE Cell Directory Service. It
   passes name service interface function calls between a Microsoft network
   operating system and a DCE computer. A network address can consist up to 80
   characters. For example, 11.1.9.169 is a valid network address.

   NOTE: The Windows NT Locator does not require a Network Address.

Digital Equipment Corporation's (DEC) DCE DCS product is required to configure
the DCE CDS as your name service provider. For more information, refer to DCE
CDS documentation available from DEC.
