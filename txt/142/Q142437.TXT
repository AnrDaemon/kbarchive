TITLE   :Error Adding Global Group to Local Group of Another Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to add a global group of a master accounts domain (maintains
user account information) to a local group on a resource domain (maintains
resources such as printer and file sharing), the following error message
appears:

   A new member could not be added to a local group because the member does not
   exist.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when a domain controller changes the domain name in order to
create a new domain. If you change the domain name of your domain controller in
Control Panel Network, the domain security identifier (SID) information remains
the same.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Reinstall Windows NT Server if you want to change the domain name of your
   domain controller.

2. Create a trust between the master accounts domain and the resource domain.

3. Add the global group of the master accounts domain to the local group of the
   resource domain.
