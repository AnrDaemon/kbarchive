TITLE   :First Line of Print Job Lost When Printing Using Lpdsvc
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you print using Lpdsvc, the TCP/IP print services, and the Generic Text
Only printer driver, the first line of each print job is not printed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is a regression caused by a fix to Txtonly.dll, which shipped in
Service Pack 4 for Windows NT version 3.51. Any print job printed using the text
data type by means of the Text Only Printer Driver will lose the first line of
output. This is most noticeable using TCP/IP Print Services because it
explicitly sets the data type of the print jobs it submits to be Text, rather
than the normal default of RAW.

RESOLUTION
==========

A hotfix for Txtonly.dll is available from Microsoft for Windows NT version 3.51
post Service Pack 5, and for Windows NT version 4.0, which fixes this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT versions
3.51 (SP4) and 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows
NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query
