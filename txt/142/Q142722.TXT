SYMPTOMS
========

After installing the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS) in
Windows 95, if you use a Dial-Up Networking connectoid to connect remotely, you
may lose access to drives mapped in your logon script. The mapped drives still
appear in My Computer and Windows Explorer, but if you try to access one of the
drives you receive the following error message:

   <drive>:\ is not accessible. Access is denied.

You can access the NetWare server without error using Network Neighborhood.
Additionally, if you run the Novell NetWare WHOAMI command, you appear to be
logged on.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following steps to correct this problem:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then
   click Dial-Up Networking.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the connectoid you want to use, and then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

3. Click Server Type, click the Log On To Network check box to clear it, and
   then click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. This
problem is resolved in Microsoft Windows 98.
