TITLE   :Locking Error or Computer Hangs Accessing Network Database Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg msnets win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A program that accesses a database on a Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT
server (or other SMB server) may exhibit the following behavior:

 - The program appears to stop responding (hang).

 - The program returns an error message stating that it was unable to lock a
   data file.

CAUSE
=====

These problems can occur if two programs are running on the same computer and
they both attempt to access the same database. The problems occur because the
network redirector routine used for unlocking the file and holding a new pending
lock does not work correctly in a multithreaded environment.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95:

   Vredir.vxd version 4.00.954 (10/10/95) and later.
