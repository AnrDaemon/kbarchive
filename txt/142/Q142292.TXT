SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic, Applications edition, is the core language technology behind
Visual Basic 4.0 and many other Microsoft applications. Because product cycles
vary, the latest version of each application may use a different version of
Visual Basic, Applications edition, each with possible differences in features
and syntax. In addition, some Microsoft applications still use proprietary macro
languages, and while mechanisms usually exist to communicate with Visual Basic
for Applications applications, these methods often vary.

Microsoft Excel 5.0 1.0
Microsoft Excel 95 1.0
Microsoft Project 4.0 1.0
Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 2.0
Microsoft Access 95 2.0

Visual Basic, Applications edition version 2.0, includes support for many new
features. All versions of Visual Basic prior to version 4.0 use an internal
language engine, and do not use Visual Basic for Applications. Microsoft Access
(up to version 2.0) uses a macro language called Access Basic, and Microsoft
Word's macro language (up to and including Word 95) is named WordBasic. These
languages have some similarities to Visual Basic for Applications, but remain
different in many ways also.
