TITLE   :Clients Using Novell ODI IPX/SPX Protocol Are Disconnected
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

MS-DOS-based and Microsoft Windows-based computers using Novell's IPX/SPX
protocol to access an AS/400 through Microsoft SNA Server are disconnected after
a brief period of inactivity.

If the client is using a 5250 emulator to communicate with an AS/400, the
following errors appear:

   Event 38: APPC session deactivated abnormally, qualifier 0005
   Event 92: APPC TP detected abend of SNA subsystem

If your client computer is using a 3270 emulator to communicate with a host, you
lose your 3270 session and be reset to the initial host signon screen upon
reconnecting.

The failure in the API trace shows:

   SEND_DATA response, result = COMM_SUBSYSTEM_ABENDED

and Events 38 and 92 are logged in the Application Log (as shown in the Event
Viewer).

CAUSE
=====

The IPX/SPX protocol is allowing a timeout to expire, after which the SNA Server
client loses it's IPX/SPX session to the SNA Server, causing SNA Server to reset
the user's host or AS/400 session.

RESOLUTION
==========

Download the latest version of IPXODI.COM from Novell, dated 8/8/95 or later and
replace the original file on the client workstation.

The following information should be added to the NET.CFG file (after the DOS
Requestor line):

   "Protocol IPXODI
   SPX Verify Timeout 65000
   SPX Abort Timeout 65000" (without the quotation marks)
