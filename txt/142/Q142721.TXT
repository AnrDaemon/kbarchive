 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Access from a network installation on a NetWare 4.1
server using the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS), you
may receive the following error message:

   A system error occurred, or there isn't enough free memory to start Microsoft
   Access. Close unneeded programs and try again.

CAUSE
=====

You are running the Microsoft Access executable file (Msaccess.exe) from a
mapped NetWare Directory Services drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95 and OSR2, as
well as later versions of this file:

   NWNP32.DLL  version 4.00.969  dated 12/20/95 10:09am  138,752 bytes

NOTE: This file is named Nwnp32.nw4 before it is installed.

This file is included in Windows 95 Service Pack 1. For more information on
obtaining Windows 95 Service Pack 1, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods:

 - Edit the target for the Msaccess.exe shortcut. Use Universal Naming
   Convention (UNC) syntax instead of a mapped drive letter. For example:

   \\$nds\.server_volume.organization\access\Msaccess.exe

 - Use Network Neighborhood to browse the container that contains the
   Msaccess.exe file. Drag a shortcut to your desktop.
