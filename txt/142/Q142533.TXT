======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Remote Registry service along with the IPX/SPX- Compatible
network protocol, you may notice an increase in the number of Service
Advertising Protocol (SAP) packets generated by Windows.

CAUSE
=====

The Remote Registry service uses Remote Procedure Call (RPC), which registers
itself over all sockets on a system that includes IPX sockets. RPC registers an
SAP type of 0x640. This is used to register and resolve names over IPX sockets.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

RPC works over NetBIOS, named pipes, or sockets. You can disable SAP only if you
have some other protocol in common that implements named pipes, TCP/IP sockets,
or NetBIOS (for example, NetBEUI).

To disable SAP over IPX sockets, delete the ncacn_spx string value from following
registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Rpc\ServerProtocols\
