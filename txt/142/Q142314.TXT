TITLE   :DOC: SET PRINT TO Command Help File Information Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00 3.00b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocfix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Visual FoxPro Help File information concerning the SET PRINT TO command is
incomplete. The information neglects to mention the NAME clause necessary for
the SET PRINTER TO command under Windows NT. Visual FoxPro 3.0b documents the
command correctly.

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the Help File in Visual FoxPro 3.0b for the proper syntax.

The Visual FoxPro 3.0 Help File states that the proper syntax for using SET PRINT
TO on a Windows NT platform is:

   SET PRINTER TO \\MachineName\PrinterName

This is incorrect. Visual FoxPro 3.0b lists the proper syntax as:

   SET PRINTER TO NAME\\ServerName\PrinterName

In Visual FoxPro 3.0b, the \\ServerName means the same thing as \\MachineName in
the Visual FoxPro 3.0 Help information. Both refer to the network name assigned
to your print server. This name is assigned by the network administrator and
must be unique.

Additional query words: docerr VFoxWin 5.00
