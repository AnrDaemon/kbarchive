TITLE   :Restrictions on Making SQL Server Changes for a Child Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Running SMSSetup at a central site does not allow you to change the reporting of
a child site from one SQL server to another or to change the SQL password for a
child site.

CAUSE
=====

SMSSetup is run directly from a site server and is used to make changes for that
site only. SMSSetup allows you to make changes to the SQL Server, such as the
server name, database, logon ID, and password. These changes are changed for the
current site only. If you change the name of the SQL Server, this means that the
current site, from which you are running SMSSetup, will report to the new
server. Currently there is no way to focus on a child site and run SMSSetup to
change the SQL Server information for that child site.

The SMS Administrator's Manual and online Help indicate that changes made are for
the current site, but in fact you cannot use the SMSSetup to make changes for a
child site.

RESOLUTION
==========

In order to make changes for a child site, SMSSetup must be run from the site
server for the child site.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.x. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
