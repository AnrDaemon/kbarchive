KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11

SYMPTOMS
========

An Intel EtherExpress MCA & MCA/TP adapter with RJ45 does not work with
Windows NT. You do not get the network connection. The link light (L) is off.

CAUSE
=====

The current .adf file combines the BNC and RJ45 connectors into one selection in
its adapter configuration.

RESOLUTION
==========

Intel has released a new .adf file. The previous version of the .adf file
combined BNC and RJ45 in a single entry (BNC/RJ45). The new .adf file enables
you to select TP(RJ45) or BNC separately. You can download E16adf.exe from:

   Intel BBS (503-264-7999)

   Intel Internet Web Pages (http://www-cs.intel.com/all/selfhelp/0e16.html)

   Intel FTP Server (ftp://ftp.intel.com/pub/PCandNetworkSupport/EtherExpress)

Steps to set up the .adf file:
------------------------------

1. Extract the file E16adf.exe and copy the @628b.adfa disk or the backup PS/2
   reference disk.

2. Turn off the computer and remove the Intel EtherExpress MCA or MCA/TP card.

3. Turn on the computer so that the system detects the removal of the card and
   reconfigures itself.

4. Turn off the computer again, replace the EtherExpress MCA or MCA/TP card back
   and turn the computer on.

5. The system detects the new card. A message appears saying the system does not
   recognize the adapter card. Put the reference disk in when you are prompted
   to do so.

6. If the new @628b.adf file was not added in the reference disk, select 'option
   diskette' and insert the disk created.

7. Select TP (RJ45).

8. Restart Windows NT.

To check whether the changes have taken place, look at the "L" light on the
adapter. If you have loaded the network card driver in Windows NT and the light
is on, you have a link to the network.
