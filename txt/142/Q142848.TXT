The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You experience problems after you install a beta version of Microsoft Internet
Information Server and then upgrade to the release version instead of deleting
the beta version first before installing the release version.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft does not recommend or support installation of released software on top
of previous beta versions. To install the released version:

1. Backup your data files and make notes of your settings.

2. Run the beta Internet Server Setup program and choose Remove All to remove
   all beta files and related registry entries.

   If you have already upgraded over your beta version, follow this same
   procedure with the release version Setup program.

3. Reboot and run Setup from the release version.

This ensures that all outdated files and registry entries are removed so there
are no conflicts between the release version and the beta version.
