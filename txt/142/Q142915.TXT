The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51

SUMMARY
=======

The installation of the Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 3 requires manual input. To
perform an unattended installation of the Service Pack, you must modify the
Service Pack information (.INF) file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To perform an unattended installation of the Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 3,
close all applications and do the following:


NOTE: Specific line changes to the files below are valid only for Windows NT 3.51
Service Pack 3. The changes described in this article are intended to be used as
a starting point, and deal only with the initial and final dialog messages. If
other errors are encountered during the update process, such as low disk space
or incorrect Windows NT version, additional dialog messages may appear.

1. Copy all Service Pack files to a working directory. For example, create a
   directory called NT351SP3 on Drive C.

2. In the working directory, copy UPDATE.INF to a new file. For example:

   COPY UPDATE.INF SP3QUIET.INF.

3. Using a text editor, edit the SP3QUIET.INF file. Comment out, by placing a
   semi-colon (;) in front of, the six lines that start at line 403 (SHELL
   through ENDIF). For example:

   ; shell "" QueryOkCancel $(String9)
   ; ifstr(i) $($R1) == "OK"
   ; else
   ; set String = $(String12)
   ; goto finish2
   ; endif

   This suppresses the initial dialog box requesting the installation of the
   service pack.

4. Comment out, with a semi-colon, three lines starting at line 578 (UI START
   through UI POP 1) and the four lines starting at line 582. For example:

   ; ui start "SetupDone"
   ; ifstr(i) $(DLGEVENT) == "CONTINUE"
   ; ui pop 1
   goto rebootend
   ; else
   ; ui pop 1
   ; goto finish1
   ; endif

   This suppresses the dialog box that prompts users to allow the system to be
   restarted. The system will reboot automatically.

5. The following line used in either a batch file or at a command prompt
   installs Windows NT Service Pack 3:

   setup.exe /s C:\NT351SP3 /i C:\NT351SP3\sp3quiet.inf

Server 1.1, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge

NOTE: You may also modify UPDATE.INF for Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 3, save the
file back as UPDATE.INF and run UPDATE.EXE from the working directory.
