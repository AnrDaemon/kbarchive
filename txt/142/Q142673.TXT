TITLE   :NetWare Drives Become Inaccessible to Certain Applications
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows NT services that interact with drives connected to NetWare
resources using Client Services for NetWare or Gateway Services for NetWare, the
connected drives become inaccessible to applications such as File Manager,
Microsoft Office 95, and Cmd.exe (the Windows NT command processor).

If you attempt to access the drive from a Windows NT command prompt, the
following error message is displayed:

   The system cannot find the drive specified.

From applications such as File Manager or Microsoft Office 95, these drives
appear not to exist at all.

If you issue a NET USE command, the computer will indicate that the drive
connection is present. Furthermore, any operations where the drive letter is
explicitly specified (for example, DIR X:\) work normally.

CAUSE
=====

The drive table entry representing the NetWare drive connection becomes
corrupted within the CSRSS process.


RESOLUTION
==========

Basesrv.dll has been corrected to prevent NetWare drive resources from becoming
orphaned in this manner.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
