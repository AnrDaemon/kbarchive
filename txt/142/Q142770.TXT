SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to determine the amount of physical memory (RAM) that
is available on your computer. Available memory is memory that is not currently
in use by Windows 95 or another program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To find out how much physical memory is available on your computer, follow these
steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
   System Tools, and then click System Monitor.

2. On the Edit menu, click Add Item.

3. Click Memory Manager in the Category box, click Free Memory in the Item box,
   and then click OK.

The Memory Manager: Free Memory line chart that is displayed on the screen shows
the amount of physical memory that is not currently in use. To remove any other
charts that are displayed in the System Monitor window, click Remove Item on the
Edit menu, click the chart that you want to remove, and then click OK. To change
all the charts that are currently displayed from line charts to bar or numeric
charts, click Bar Charts or Numeric Charts on the View menu. To modify how often
the displayed charts are updated, click Chart on the Options menu.

System Monitor is not installed when the Typical, Compact, or Portable Setup type
is chosen when you install Windows 95. To install System Monitor after you
install Windows 95, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

2. Click the Windows Setup tab.

3. Click Accessories, and then click Details.

4. Click the System Monitor check box to select it, and then click OK.

5. Click OK.

the floppy disk version. If you are using the floppy disk version of Windows 95
and you want to use System Monitor, please see the following article in the
