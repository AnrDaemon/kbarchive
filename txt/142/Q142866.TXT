PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Your DEC Alpha XL 266 computer with a Proteon 1392+ Revision E and above Token
Ring network interface card (NIC) does not work with Windows NT version 3.51.

The Proteon P139x-Plus (a.k.a. 1392+) revision D Token Ring NICs work correctly
with Windows NT 3.51.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have a Proteon P139X-Plus Rev E or above NIC, copy the older p139x
driver, PRORAPM.DWN (date: 08/22/94, size: 24,734 bytes) over the current
version.

NOTE: This older driver also works on the Rev D NICs.

The older driver can be found on the Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 4 CD-ROM in the
following directory:

   \SUPPORT\NDIS\PROTEON\PRORAPM.DWN

Copy this file to the \%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS directory and reboot your
computer.

This older driver is also available as a self-extracting executable from Proteon
at:

   ftp://ftp.proteon.com/pub/bbs/pronet4_16/p139x/prorapm.exe

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
