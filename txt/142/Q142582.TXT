TITLE   :3D Movie Maker: Clicks During Melanie Talking Don't Invoke Act
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft 3D Movie Maker for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click an item while either Melanie (in the Projects Room) or McZee (in
the Ideas Room, Projects Room, and so on) is talking, and/or giving
instructions, the action associated with that item is not started. The second
time you click in the same place, the action associated with that item is
carried out.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is by design. Clicking anywhere on the screen should stop Melanie or McZee
talking, but you should click an item again to activate that item.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The instructions that McZee and Melanie give are presented as videos (.avi
files) that overlay the background. Clicking the area of the screen where the
video is playing only stops the delivery of instructions. When instructions are
being given, there are two applications running: 3D Movie Maker and the
instructions video. Clicking the video closes that application; you can then
proceed to click an item you want.
