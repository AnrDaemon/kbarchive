TITLE   :BUG: System Receives Permissions When No Permissions Specified
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you copy files into an NTFS directory that has "Access Not Specified"
chosen for ALL file-level permissions for ALL users (through "Special File
Access..." for the Directory permissions), the expected behavior is that only
the file owner should have file permission. However, both the owner and System
are given full-control. This happens even though System has no permissions at
the directory level.

To see this behavior, no one can have any file permissions in the directory. If
anyone has a single permission for the file, then only those permissions are
applied to the file. This is expected behavior, and it seems reasonable that if
no one has any permissions to the file, then none should be given.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
