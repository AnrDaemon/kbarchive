-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you install the CompuServe WinCim version 2.0.1 software in Windows NT 3.5
or 3.51, the following error message appears:

   Winsock error: Host not found.
   Would you like more information?

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the WinCim installation program detects that you are
using the Windows NT Winsock support. The following message appears when you
install the Windows NT Winsock software:

   Windows NT does not allow the CompuServe Dialer to be used in place of its
   native Winsock support.

By default, the CompuServe Dialer Winsock is enabled when you start WinCim. This
does not allow Windows NT to use its native Winsock service.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, disable the WinCim Winsock support. In WinCim, select
Session Settings from the the Special menu in WinCim. Select Option and clear
the Use Winsock check box.

The WinCim product discussed here is manufactured by CompuServe, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
