TITLE   :Setup of OS/2 Logon Servers Fails Under WinNT 3.51 SP3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbMaintMan smsmaintman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) will not set up an OS/2 logon server
if the site server is running Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack (SP) 3. There is a
change in Windows NT 3.51 SP3 that does not allow execution of a DIR command on
the UNC name of an OS/2 1.3 server share. When this command is executed, the
response is always "File Not Found." This behavior does not apply to Windows NT
3.51 SP2.


CAUSE
=====

The Maintenance Manager uses the above technique as a way of verifying that it
can see the OS/2 server share. Since this fails, no files get downloaded to the
logon server's SMS_SHR. The result is that the SMS Administrator UI believes
that the logon servers are configured correctly, but in fact the OS/2 logon
server is nonoperational.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
