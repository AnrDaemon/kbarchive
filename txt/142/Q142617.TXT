TITLE   :Server Rejects TreeConnectAndX and DirectorySearch SMB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Some applications running on IBM OS/2 Lan Requester clients may fail when
accessing files located on Windows NT server shares.

CAUSE
=====

This problem happens when the Server Message Block (SMB) client chains the
TreeConnectAndX and DirectorySearch commands in the same SMB.

Since Windows NT Server incorrectly rejects this SMB, the client application is
prevented from working correctly.

This problem occurs when the connection to the share and the DirectorySearch are
issued in the same SMB.

RESOLUTION
==========

Using "map drive" instead of uniform naming convention (UNC) names prevents
these commands from being chained together.

You can also resolve this problem by upgrading to Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMB specification allows some commands to be chained together in the same SMB.
The Lan Manager 1.x book states that the DirectorySearch command is one of the
authorized chained commands for TreeConnectAndX.

When the server rejects an SMB request, it also logs event 2006: "The server
received an incorrectly formatted request from the server \\<server
name>."

The data associated with this event shows the beginning of the rejected SMB and
may help to identify the problem.
