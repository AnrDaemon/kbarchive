SUMMARY
=======

The Setdflag.c sample program in the Help under _CrtSetDbgFlag(), contains the
following section of code which is missing a tilde (~) character:

   /*
   * Set the debug-heap flag to no longer keep freed blocks in the
   * heap's linked list and turn on Debug type allocations (CLIENT)
   */ 
    tmpDbgFlag = _CrtSetDbgFlag(_CRTDBG_REPORT_FLAG);
    tmpDbgFlag |= _CRTDBG_ALLOC_MEM_DF;
    tmpDbgFlag &= _CRTDBG_DELAY_FREE_MEM_DF;  // This line is wrong
    _CrtSetDbgFlag(tmpDbgFlag);

The third line of code should be:

    tmpDbgFlag &= ~_CRTDBG_DELAY_FREE_MEM_DF;

MORE INFORMATION
================

To disable a flag with the _CrtSetDbgFlag() function, you should AND the
variable with the bitwise NOT of the bitmask.
