TITLE   :Modification to Support Direct Host IPX Acceleration Drivers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A new interface has been added to the Server Message Block (SMB) server which
allows an acceleration driver to "hook up" to Srv.sys for acceleration of direct
host IPX operations. Network Interface Cards that support this acceleration are
available from third-party vendors.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The interface is a new FSCTL (FSCTL_SRV_IPX_SMART_CARD_START) which passes a
data structure into Srv.sys (struct SRV_IPX_SMART_CARD) having pointers to the
driver acceleration routines. When a direct host IPX client subsequently does
open, close, and read operations on disk files, Srv.sys passes the request to
the acceleration driver for servicing.

This new interface is included in Windows NT 4.0, and is available for Windows NT
3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT U.S. Service Pack.
