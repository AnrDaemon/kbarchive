SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows 95 on a computer that has Never Ending Drive installed,
you receive the following error message the first time Setup restarts the
computer:

   Windows has disabled direct disk access to protect your long file- names. To

   " edit autoexec.bat " (without the quotation marks)

3. Type "REM" (without the quotation marks) at the beginning of the line
   containing the Never Ending Drive program file (Nedprotect.exe).

4. Press ALT+F to open the File menu, and then press S to save the Autoexec.bat
   file.

5. Press ALT+F to open the File menu, and then press X to close the text editor.

6. Restart the computer. Never Ending Drive should be disabled and Windows 95
   Setup should continue.
