SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to add the Valupack ClipArt from the Microsoft Office
for Windows 95 compact disc to your hard disk, and how to access the Valupack
ClipArt directly from the compact disc.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can access Valupack ClipArt in one of two ways: you can copy the files to
your hard disk for fastest access, or, if you want to conserve disk space, you
can access the clip art from the compact disc. If you choose the second option,
note that each time you select ClipArt, you will be prompted to reinsert the
compact disc. If you want to run the ClipArt from the compact disc, skip the
next section and see the "How to Access ClipArt from the Compact Disc" section
later in this article.

Copying the Files to the Hard Disk
----------------------------------

To copy the .pcs and .cag files to your local hard disk, follow these steps:

1. Start Windows Explorer.

2. Select the compact disc drive where the Microsoft Office compact disc has
   been inserted.

3. Navigate to the <drive>:\Valupack\ClipArt folder, where <drive>
   is the compact disc drive letter.

4. Select all .pcs and .cag files.

5. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

6. Navigate to the <drive>:\Msoffice\ClipArt\Pcsfiles folder, where
   <drive> is where Microsoft Office is installed.

7. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

How to Access ClipArt from the Compact Disc
-------------------------------------------

1. Start one of the Office programs.

2. On the Insert menu, click Object.

3. Select ClipArt Gallery. Click OK.

4. Click Organize.

5. Click Add Pictures.

6. Select ClipArt Gallery Packages from the Files Of Type box.

7. Change to the C:\Msoffice\ClipArt\Pcsfiles folder, or if you want to run from
   the compact disc, change to the <drive>:\Valupack\ClipArt folder, where
   <drive> is the compact disc drive letter.

8. Select one of the .cag files listed, and then click Open. This step will add
   images to that Category.

9. Repeat steps 4 through 8 for each of the .cag files in the PCSfiles folder.
   (There are 25 .cag files on the compact disc.)
