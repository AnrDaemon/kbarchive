SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses installing the Internet Information Server (IIS) FTP
service when the Microsoft Windows NT FTP service is already installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recommends that you remove the installation of Microsoft Windows NT
FTP service before you install the IIS FTP service.

However, if you try to install IIS over Microsoft Windows NT FTP service, the IIS
Setup program detects the Windows NT FTP service and gives you the following
option message:

   Setup has detected Microsoft Windows NT FTP service in the system. In order
   for Microsoft Internet Information Server's FTP service to function properly
   you need to disable the Microsoft Windows NT FTP Service. Do you wish to
   disable the service now?

If you select Yes, the Microsoft Windows NT FTP service is disabled, and the IIS
FTP service is enabled. If you select No, the Microsoft Windows NT FTP service
remains enabled, and the IIS FTP service is disabled.

If you select Yes and later want to re-enable the original Microsoft Windows NT
FTP service, you must first remove the IIS FTP service and re-enable the
Microsoft Windows NT FTP service from Control Panel, Services, Startup.
