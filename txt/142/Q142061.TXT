TITLE   :Preloaded LMHOSTS Entries Overwrite Previous Entries

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Your Windows NT computer has multiple Lmhosts entries preloaded for the same
NetBIOS name and the NetBIOS Name table only contains the last entry in the
Lmhosts file.

CAUSE
=====

The LMHosts file is read sequentially from top to bottom. The preloaded entries
are no exception so if you have two entries for the same NetBIOS name that are
preloaded in your LMHosts file, the first entry listed in the LMHosts file will
be overwritten and the second entry will be used.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue you need to edit the Lmhosts file so that it contains only
one entry for each NetBIOS name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you preload entries with the special keyword #PRE, this causes the entry to
be preloaded into the name cache. Normally, to speed up the searches, these
entries should be left for the end of the file because they are preloaded into
cache and are not accessed later.
