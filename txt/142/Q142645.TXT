TITLE   :FPNW Stops with Win3.x Client Directory Search: "********.***"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use File Manager from a Windows 3.1 Novell client to search a Windows
NT 3.51 File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) Server for files named
********.***, the server stops with various STOP error messages.

CAUSE
=====

The crash is caused by the use of multiple wildcard symbols (*) to the left of
the period in the filename. A single wildcard on either side does not cause the
problem, nor does using multiple question marks (?) as a wildcard symbol.

This problem has been reproduced from Windows 3.1 systems running Novell client
1.20a and Windows for Workgroups servers running Novell Client 1.20a; it does
not occur with Windows NT or Windows 95 clients.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, use only a single wildcard (*) on either side of the
period (*.*) when doing directory searches.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
