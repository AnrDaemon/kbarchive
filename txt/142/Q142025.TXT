TITLE   :PRB: NTBackup and Beam & Whiteside NFS Generate DR. Watson
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use NTbackup to back up a shared NFS volume over the network by using
Beam & Whiteside's NFS software, NTbackup may cause a DR Watson error when
starting to backup the NFS volume. For example:

   The application error states that the instruction at 0x79f94867 cannot read
   memory at 00000000.

CAUSE
=====

Version 3.6 of Beam & Whitside software that works with 3.51 does not allow
NTbackup to back up NFS volumes. The version for 3.5 allows you to do so, but
you must also back down to Windows NT 3.5 in order for this version to work. The
only other workaround is to attach a backup device to the machine containing the
NFS volume.

STATUS
======

Beam & Whiteside tech support is aware of this problem and currently working
on a fix. You can reach their Tech support at 416-496-2200.
