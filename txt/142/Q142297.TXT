IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

Your NetWare network printer may be offline, or you may receive the following
error message:

   Cannot connect to network printer. Make sure your network is working properly
   and the network share you are connecting to exists.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the registry entry for the Microsoft Print Provider
for NetWare is set incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

Use Registry Editor to check the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers\ 
   Microsoft Print Provider for NetWare

If you have installed the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks without the
Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS), the Name string value
should be set to:

   Nwpp32.dll

If you are using the Microsoft Client for NetWare networks with MSNDS, the Name
string value should be set to:

   Ndspp.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
