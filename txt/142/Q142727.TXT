PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After System Agent runs ScanDisk on a drive compressed with Stacker that is the
last drive scanned, the Last Result column in System Agent displays the
following message:

   Errors were found and some were not fixed


CAUSE
=====

ScanDisk checks Stacker volumes for only non-compression related errors. The
message stated above is returned to System Agent when ScanDisk is finished, even
if no errors are found.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run ScanDisk from the Start menu to check Stacker volumes for non- compression
related errors. To do so, click the Start button, point to programs, point to
Accessories, and then click ScanDisk.

Or, use Stacker's disk tools to check the integrity of Stacker volumes. For
information about how to do so, please consult the Stacker documentation.

WARNING: The tools included with Stacker versions 4.0 and earlier are not aware
of the long file names that Windows 95 supports and may damage them.

For additional information about Stacker and long file names, please see the
