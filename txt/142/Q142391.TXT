SUMMARY
=======

The "Not for Resale" (NFR) version of Windows NT 4.0 is limited to five users.
The version of Windows NT Server 4.0 that ships with Microsoft Developer Network
(MSDN) is limited to ten users. If your environment requires more than these
limits, you must install the retail version of Windows NT Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is important to note that you cannot upgrade the NFR or the MSDN version of
Windows NT Server to the retail version. To successfully run the retail version,
you must install the retail version in a new folder, and then re- install your
applications.

Before you install the retail version of Windows NT Server, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q125996

   TITLE : Useful Resource Kit Utilities for Domain Administrators

To preserve user accounts, if the affected computer is a domain controller, you
can install another computer as a Backup Domain Controller, promote it,
re-install the old computer as a Backup Domain Controller, and then promote the
newly installed computer to the Primary Domain Controller. Once this is done the
Backup Domain Controller is no longer needed.
