TITLE   :FIX: Non-SourceSafe Visual Test Files Show Up as Checked Out
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbSSafe400bug kbSSafe500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

At the close of a project, the Check In dialog box shows that files that aren't
under Source Code Control (SCC) but are in a Visual Test (VT) project workspace
are checked out.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Visual SourceSafe
Integration portion of Visual Test version 4.0 for Windows. This problem has
been fixed in Visual SourceSafe 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Set up a Project Workspace 1 containing two folders Dir1 and Dir2.

2. In Dir1, place the files under SCC, and check them out.

3. In Dir2, ensure that the files are not under SCC.

4. On the Tools menu, click Options, click the Source Control tab, select the
   "Check in files when closing the workspace" option, and click OK.

5. On the File menu, click New, click Project Workspace, and click OK.

6. Click Yes to "Some files in the workspace are not checked in. Do you want to
   check them in now?"

At this point, the expected behavior is that the files in Dir2 would not be
listed in "Check in files" window. But in fact, the Dir2 files are listed (but
they not checked or selected).
