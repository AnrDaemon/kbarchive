SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Internet Information Server provides users with a secure communication
channel through support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and RSA encryption. In
addition, support is provided for Private Communication Technology (PCT), which
is an efficient and secure upgrade to the SSL protocol.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PCT/SSL protocols provide secure data communication through data encryption
and decryption. A PCT/SSL-enabled server can send and receive private
communication across the Internet to PCT/SSL-enabled clients (browsers), such as
Microsoft Internet Explorer version 2.0 for Windows 95 (included on the
Microsoft Internet Information Server compact disc in the \CLIENTS directory).

In the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model, PCT and SSL are protocol layers
between the TCP/IP transport/network layer and the application layer where HTTP
operates. PCT/SSL provide server authentication, encryption, and data integrity.
Authentication assures the client that data is being sent to the correct server
and that the server is secure. Encryption assures that the data cannot be read
by anyone other than the secure target server. Data integrity assures that the
data being transferred has not been altered.

Enabling PCT/SSL security on a Microsoft Internet Information Server involves the
following steps:

1. Generate a key pair file and a request file.

2. Request a certificate from a Certification Authority.*

3. Install the certificate on your server.

4. Activate PCT/SSL security on a WWW service directory.

* Digital certificates can be obtained from Verisign. For more information, point

You can find more information on the implementation of PCT/SSL in the Microsoft
Internet Information Server Installation and Planning guide, pages 58 - 63.
