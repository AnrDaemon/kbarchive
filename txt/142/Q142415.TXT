======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When code uses the PostThreadMessage() Win32 function, the MFC message handlers
are not called.


CAUSE
=====

When you call PostThreadMessage(), the message is placed in the thread's message
queue. However, because messages posted this way are not associated with a
window, MFC will not dispatch them to message or command handlers. In order to
handle these messages, override the PreTranslateMessage() function of your
CWinApp-derived class, and handle the messages manually.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following code demonstrates how to call PostThreadMessage() in the
InitInstance() of the CWinApp-derived class using a single-threaded application.
The principle is the same for secondary threads except that the code shown here
would be put in your alternate CWinThread-derived class.

Visual C++ 4.2 does support handling messages posted to threads. For more
information, see ON_THREAD_MESSAGE in the Visual C++ 4.2 documentation.

NOTE: MFC worker threads do not have a message loop/pump associated with them so
you must use a user-interface thread.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed:

      standard MFC project generated by AppWizard */ 

   BOOL CThreadMsgApp::PreTranslateMessage(MSG* pMsg)
   {
       // Is it the Message you want?
       // You can use a switch statement but because this is
       // only looking for one message, you can use the if/else
       if (pMsg->message == WM_USER+2268)
       {
           // Call the function to handle this message
      OnReceivedCommand(pMsg->wParam,pMsg->lParam);
           // Tell MFC no more processing is needed
           return TRUE;
       }
       else
           // Call MFC to have it continue processing the message
           return CWinThread::PreTranslateMessage(pMsg);
   }

   BOOL CThreadMsgApp::InitInstance()
   {
       WPARAM wParam;
       LPARAM lParam;
       wParam = MAKEWPARAM(0,0); // We can put whatever we
       lParam = MAKELPARAM(0,0); // want in wParam & lParam

       // Send the user-defined Thread Message
       // m_nThreadID is a member of CWinThread that holds the thread ID
       PostThreadMessage(m_nThreadID, WM_USER+2268, wParam, lParam);

       return TRUE;
   }

   void CThreadMsgApp::OnReceivedCommand(WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
   {
       // You can do whatever you want in here, this is simply
       // sending output to the debug window
       TRACE0("Received WM_USER+2268!!\n");
   }
