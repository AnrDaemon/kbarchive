SUMMARY
=======

This article describes where Visual FoxPro installs the Win32s files on a
network that has shared windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a network administrator has installed Windows on a network, a "shared
windows" directory is created on a network drive that all users of the network
must have access to. In addition to the "shared windows" directory, each user
has a directory either on the server or on their local hard drive that contains
their personal .ini, .grp, and reg.dat files. This server-based installation of
Windows does not have a "system" subdirectory.

For more information about Windows setup, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q83194 WW0526: Windows 3.1 Setup


A proper network installation of Windows 3.1 on a network does not create a
system subdirectory. Normally, Visual FoxPro installs the Win32s files in the
Windows\System directory. Installing Visual FoxPro to a network that has a
shared copy of Windows does not create a system subdirectory. The Win32s
directory is created off of the "shared Windows" directory.



Each Visual FoxPro user's System.ini file must contain references to this Win32s
directory. The administrator must be the only person on the network using
Windows when Visual FoxPro is installed.

To install Visual FoxPro to a network type:

   " x:setup/a " (without the quotation marks)

where x is the letter representing the disk or CD-ROM drive.

After a successful network installation of Visual FoxPro. The administrator must
perform a workstation installation for each workstation. See page 5 of the
Installation Guide and Master Index book for additional information on setup
methods. If Win32s is not referenced in the workstation's System.ini file, the
workstation setup will try to install Win32s and modify the workstation's
System.ini file as follows:
