SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to integrate a downloaded Encarta Monthly Update .eyb (Yearbook
Builder) file, you receive the following error message:

   Unexpected error occurred while unpacking the file c:\program files\microsoft
   reference\encarta 96 encyc\yearbook\*.eyb

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when a Yearbook integration has previously failed. The
previous attempt created a .ybk (Yearbook) file stub in the Windows folder

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do the following:

1. Search your hard drive for *.ybk files. For more information about searching
   for files in Windows, see your Windows printed documentation or online Help.

2. Delete any .ybk files not in the Encarta\yearbook folder.

3. Restart Encarta and click Integrate.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the 1996 edition of Encarta
Encyclopedia for Windows.
