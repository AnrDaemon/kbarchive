TITLE   :Logon Server Files Not Downloaded on OS/2 and LAN Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you run a Systems Management Server site in Windows NT Server 3.51 Service
Pack 3 and set up an OS/2 server or an IBM LAN Server as a logon server, files
for logon servers are not downloaded. However, SMS Admin reports that the logon
servers are functioning properly.

In addition, Event ID 116 and 117 are logged in the Application log of Event
Viewer, and an Error 183 (cannot create file when file already exists) appears
in MAINTMAN.LOG when attempting to create SMS_SHR.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Systems Management Server Maintenance Manager is not
able to verify the file and directory attributes of the OS/2 server or LAN
Server share. Therefore, Site_Config_Manager fails to copy files to the
LOGON.SRV directory and create the X86.BIN or SMSID sub-directories.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 Service
Pack 3. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT version 3.51 Service Pack
4.
