TITLE   :Time Zone Map Does Not Highlight Borders
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Windows NT 4.0 is installed, the time zone map does not highlight the
borders of the currently selected time zone, nor can you click the map. This
functionality is different from Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. Many countries around the world have border disputes with
other countries in which two (or more) countries claim the same territory as
their own. It is not the desire of Microsoft to take any position in these
disputes; therefore, the time zone map no longer reflects the borders of time
zones.

RESOLUTION
==========

Instead of clicking the map to set the correct time zone, click the drop- down
control and select the correct time zone from those provided.
