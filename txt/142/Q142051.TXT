PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On your computer running Windows NT with a Panasonic LF7304 Optical disk
installed on a SCSI adapter, various error messages can appear. For example, the
drive may not be recognized as having any partitions, may get CRC errors, or you
may receive error messages from Disk Administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This drive has a proprietary format from the manufacturer, which you need to
remove prior to using it with Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prepare the drive for operation as a secondary drive on a system that is
running Windows NT already on another drive:

1. Boot to MS-DOS and perform a low level format on the Panasonic LF7304 Optical
   disk drive.

2. Boot Windows NT and run Disk Administrator.

   The drive appears as "RAW".

3. Format the drive with Disk Administrator.
