The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 1.0, 1.05, 1.2, 1.3, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to view your online statement or other billing option, you may
receive the following error message:

   Cannot open shortcuts. Please try again later.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Onlstmt.exe file is missing from the Program
Files\The Microsoft Network folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the Onlstmt.exe file is missing, extract it from the Windows 95 CD-ROM by
following these steps:

1. Click Start, Point to Programs and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

2. Change to the drive and folder that contains the Windows 95 CD-ROM.

3. Type the following (from a DOS prompt in the same folder as the Windows 95
   CAB files):

   "EXTRACT WIN95_07.CAB ONLSTMT.EXE /L C:\PROGRA~1\THEMIC~1" (without the
   quotation marks)

This will extract the onlstmt.exe file to the Program Files\The Microsoft Network
folder.
