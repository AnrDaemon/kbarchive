TITLE   :XADM: Error -509 Starting Directory, IS, or Dirsync Services
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 Directory service,
Information Store service, or the Directory Synchronization service, the service
does not start. The Windows NT Event Log indicates that the service in question
returned an error code of -509.

CAUSE
=====

This error is returned by the Exchange Server database engine when it encounters
a problem replaying log files on startup. Possible reasons for the error are as
follows:

 - Missing Transaction Log Files.
   When each service starts, it looks for its transaction log files to replay any
   missing transactions. These log files are by default in the DSADATA, MDBDATA,
   and DXADATA directories for the Directory, Information Store, and Directory
   Synchronization services respectively. The location of the log files for each
   service is configurable through the Exchange Server Performance Wizard.

   While replaying the transactions, if a transaction log file is missing, the
   above error is returned. For example, suppose the DSADATA directory contains
   the following transaction log files: EDB.LOG, EDB00001.LOG, EDB00002.LOG,
   EDB00004.LOG, and EDB00005.LOG. It is missing the EDB00003.LOG file. When the
   Directory Service starts replaying these logs, it will start with EDB.LOG,
   then go to EDB00005.LOG and then EDB00004.LOG. When it finds the log file
   EDB00003.LOG is missing it will abort because it cannot proceed to file
   EDB00002.LOG without processing EDB00003.LOG.

 - One or more logs are inaccessible. The log files are marked as read-only, are
   hidden, or the Exchange Server service account does not have the necessary
   access rights.

 - Not enough free disk space on the drive containing the databases.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. When a log file is missing follow the below procedure:

   a. Move all log files created before the missing file out of the log
      directory (that is, log files with numerically lower names). In the above
      example, files EDB00002.LOG and EDB00001.LOG should be removed from the
      directory.

   b. Move the EDBCHK.LOG file out of the log directory.

   c. Restart the services.

2. One or more Log files is inaccessible.

   Check the file permissions and attributes. Make sure that none of the log
   files is hidden or read-only. The Exchange Service account should have full
   access to the log files.

3. Lack of free disk space on the drive containing the Exchange databases.

   Free up disk space by deleting files and/or directories.
