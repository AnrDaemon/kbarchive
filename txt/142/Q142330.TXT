TITLE   :User-Level Security Not Enabled with Custom Setup Script
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msnets win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you use the Server-Based Setup tool (Netsetup.exe) to create a custom
Setup script that is designed to enable user-level security, user-level security
may not be enabled when you install Windows 95 from the shared Windows 95 folder
on the server.

CAUSE
=====

When you use Netsetup.exe to create a custom Setup script and specify that
user-level security should be enabled, the following line is added to the custom
Setup script

   UserSecurity=<agent>

where <agent> is the type of security agent used to provide pass-through
validation for user-level security. Pass-through validation can be provided by a
Microsoft Windows NT domain, a Windows NT-based computer, or a Novell NetWare
server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Use a text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the custom Setup script and
   modify the "UserSecurity=" line so that it reads

   Security=<agent>

   where <agent> is the type of security agent used to provide pass-
   through validation for user-level security.

 - Use the Batch Setup tool (Batch.exe) to create your custom Setup script
   instead of the Server-Based Setup tool. Batch.exe is located in the
   Admin\Nettools\Netsetup folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. You can install this
   tool using the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. You can also
   install Batch.exe as part of the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit.

   NOTE: The Batch Setup tool is included in the CD-ROM version of Windows 95,
   but not in the floppy disk version. To use the Batch Setup tool you must have
   the CD-ROM version of Windows 95.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
