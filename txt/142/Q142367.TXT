TITLE   :MS-DOS Clients Cannot Log On Across Router with TCP/IP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a domain across a router using the TCP/IP protocol from a LAN
Manager 2.2c client computer or a Network Client 3.0 client computer configured
as a WINS client, NET3778 error message appears.

CAUSE
=====

The client computer sends a NetLogon request that is broadcasted locally. The
WINS server is not queried to find a list of domain controllers.

NOTE: When you use NET.EXE (such as "net use" or "net view"), a WINS server is
queried for NetBIOS name resolution.

WORKAROUND
==========

Add the following entry for a domain controller in the LMHOSTS file:

   #DOM:<domain name>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in LAN Manager version 2.2c and
Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

Additional query words: prodnt 2.20 3.00 lanman
