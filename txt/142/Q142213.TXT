SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create a simple form that automatically prompts a
user to fill in information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Follow these steps to create a template with automatic fill-in fields:

1. On the File menu, click New.

2. Select Blank Document.

3. Under Create New, select Template. Click OK.

4. Create the Fill-in Fields.

   There are two methods you can use to create fill-in fields: menus and
   keystrokes. Select the method best suited for you.

   Method 1: Creating a Field Using the Menus:

   a. Position the insertion point where you want to insert the text field.

   b. On the Insert menu, click Field.

   c. In the Categories list, select Mail Merge.

   d. In the Field Names list, select Fill-in.

   e. The FILLIN field is displayed in the Field Codes text box below the
      Categories list. Click inside of the text box to the right of the word
      FILLIN and type quotation marks around the prompt you want to display. For
      example, use the following syntax to display a prompt asking the user to
      enter their name:

   FILLIN "Please enter your first and last name."

   f. Click OK. You will see a sample of the prompt. Click OK to return to your
      document.

      NOTE: To view the field code you just inserted, press ALT+F9.

   g. Repeat steps a-f for every place in the document where you want a fill-in
      field.

Method 2: Creating a Field Using Keystrokes.

   a. Position the insertion point where you want to insert the field.

   b. Press CTRL+F9. Field braces, { }, appear in the document.

   c. Position the insertion point inside the field braces.

   d. Type the following, where <prompt> is what Word asks the user to
      type:

   FILLIN "<prompt>"

      NOTE: If you press F9 while the insertion point is still on the field, you
      can see a sample of the prompt that will be displayed. This step is not
      necessary to create the fill-in.

5. On the File menu, click Save As.

6. Name the template appropriately.

Using the Template
------------------

To create new documents based on the new template, follow these steps.

1. On the File menu, click New.

2. Click to select your template.

3. Click OK.

Word creates a new document, automatically searches for all fill-in fields in the
document and begins to prompt the user for input.
