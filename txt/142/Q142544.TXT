SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the command-line switches for Win.com. Win.com is called by
Io.sys after the Autoexec.bat file is processed, and starts the Windows 95/98
startup process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The syntax for Win.com is:

   WIN {/D:[F] [M] [N] [S] [V] [X]} [/W] [/WX]

The command-line switches for Win.com are described below:

   /W  Restores the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files from Config.wos
       and Autoexec.wos and prompts:

          Press any key to continue...
          Pressing a key reboots the system back to Windows 95/98.

   /WX Restores the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files from Config.wos
       and Autoexec.wos and reboots the system to Windows 95/98.

       NOTE: .wos files are created when you open a program requiring
       MS-DOS mode and you have specified a new MS-DOS-mode
       configuration. You might need to use the /W or /WX switch if you
       shut off your computer while you are running an MS-DOS-based
       program that requires MS-DOS mode and you want to return to
       Windows 95/98.

   /D: Used for troubleshooting when Windows 95/98 does not start
       correctly. This switch is used with the following switches:

       F  Turns off 32-bit disk access. This is equivalent to
          "32BitDiskAccess=false" in the System.ini file.

       M  Enables Safe mode. This is automatically enabled during a
          Safe-mode boot (by pressing F5).

       N  Enables Safe mode with networking. This is automatically
          enabled during a Safe-mode boot (by pressing F6).

       S  Specifies that Windows 95/98 should not use ROM address space
          between F000:0000 and 1 MB for a break point. This is
          equivalent to the "SystemROMBreakPoint=false" setting in the
          [386Enh] section of the System.ini file.

       V  Specifies that the ROM routine handles interrupts from the
          hard disk controller. This is equivalent to the
          "VirtualHDIRQ=false" setting in the System.ini file.

       X  Excludes all of the adapter area from the range of memory that
          Windows 95/98 scans to find unused space. This is equivalent to
          the "EMMExclude=A000-FFFF" setting in the System.ini file.

   NOTE: The following /D: parameters do not work in Windows 98:

    - /D:FSVXN
    - /D:N
