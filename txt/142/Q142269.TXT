TITLE   :Garbled Graphics Output on Shared PostScript Printer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.11,3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a graphics print job to a shared postscript printer on a Windows
NT Server from a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 computer using the IPX/SPX
compatible transport protocol (NWLink), the first page of the output is garbled.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 computer sends the
print job to the Windows NT Server using direct hosting over IPX. Direct hosting
allows the Server Message Block (SMB) file sharing protocol to be used over a
connectionless datagram transport such as IPX. This bypasses the NetBIOS layer
and sends the data in blocks, which are re- assembled at the server. These
blocks are not re-assembled correctly.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use another protocol such as TCP/IP or NetBEUI on
both the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 computer and Windows NT Server. Make sure
you disable the binding of Server and NWLink on the Windows NT Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
