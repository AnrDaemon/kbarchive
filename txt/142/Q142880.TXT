TITLE   :NetBT Fails to Bind to a Large Number of IP Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a computer running Windows NT is configured with a large number of IP
addresses through the registry, NetBT may fail to bind. The following event log
error may be generated:

   Initialization failed because the driver device could not be created.

CAUSE
=====

Only five IP addresses can be configured per network interface using the TCP/IP
configuration screens. However, more may be added using the registry editor.
When a large number of IP addresses is assigned to a single Network Interface
card, NetBT may fail to bind. Reports on the number of addresses attainable
without failure vary from 16 to about 24.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
