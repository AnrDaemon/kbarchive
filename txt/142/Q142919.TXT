KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to compress drive C with DriveSpace 3, you may receive the
following error message when the compression process is 25 percent finished:

   Windows cannot create the C:\Msdossys.tmp file. There might not be enough
   free space on the drive C, the root directory of drive C may be full, or the
   disk may be write-protected.

   ID Number DRVSPACE125

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if the root folder on drive C contains the maximum
allowable number of files (512). When this occurs, DriveSpace 3 cannot create
the temporary files it needs to finish the compression process.

RESOLUTION
==========

Move or delete unnecessary files in the root folder on drive C, and then
continue the compression process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The root folder on a hard disk can contain no more than 512 directory entries.
Directory entries can contain short file names and the extra entries required to
hold long file names.

Note that the error may also occur when the compression process is 100 percent
finished if you are compressing a drive that is not the boot drive. The actual
file referenced in the error message will vary. The error message "Cannot create
the file Drvspace.000" is generated when the root folder of the drive being
compressed is full.

The error message stated above can also occur if there is a file named
Failsafe.drv in the root folder of drive C (or the host for drive C). If this
occurs, remove the Failsafe.drv file and then continue the compression
operation.
