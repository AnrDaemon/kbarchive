SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft products including Visual C++ support a wide range of national and
international standards. There is an application called the Microsoft Roadmap to
Developer Products and Services that is shipped on the Visual C++ 4.0 CD-ROM
compact disc that enables you to find all the standards that a Microsoft product
supports. The application also provides a lot of other information about
Microsoft developer products. To run it, you need to first install it by running
the Setup.exe program in the Roadmap subdirectory of the CD-ROM compact disc.

If you do not have Visual C++ 4.0 and want to get a copy of the Microsoft Roadmap
application, you can order it from the Microsoft Developer Solutions Team by
calling (800) 426-9400.
