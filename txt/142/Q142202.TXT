SUMMARY
=======

There are times when you may want to show the progress of a process on the
status bar. Developer Studio does this when loading a project. You can implement
this by using CStatusBar and CProgressCtrl.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A default AppWizard-generated MFC application has a class (CMainFrame) that
contains a member variable m_wndStatusBar of type CStatusBar. The following
sample code uses this member variable as the parent of a CProgressCtrl, which
will be positioned over the first pane of m_wndStatusBar. First, the
CProgressCtrl is created. Then, the sample code simulates a lengthy process
using the Sleep function in a for loop.

Sample Code
-----------

      /* Compile options needed: default
      */ 

      // This is a menu option handler that takes a long period of time
      void CMainFrame::OnLengthyProcess()
      {
          // Create the CProgressCtrl as a child of the status bar positioned
          // over the first pane.

          RECT rc;
          m_wndStatusBar.GetItemRect (0, &rc);
          CProgressCtrl wndProgress;
          VERIFY (wndProgress.Create(WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE, rc,
                                                  &m_wndStatusBar, 1));
          wndProgress.SetRange(0, 50);
          wndProgress.SetStep(1);

          // Perform some lengthy process, simulated here with a for loop
          // and the Sleep function.

          for(int i=0;i<50;i++)
          {
             Sleep(50);
             wndProgress.StepIt();
          }
      }
