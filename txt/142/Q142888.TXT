TITLE   :FIX: Developer Studio Fails to Recognize Makefile and Quits
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC kbVC410fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open a previously valid workspace file, Developer Studio
displays the following error message:

   The makefile <makefile pathname> has been modified and cannot be used
   as an internal project workspace.

When you click the OK button, the following information appears:

   <makefile pathname>

   This makefile was not generated by Developer Studio.

   Continuing will create a new Developer Studio workspace to wrap this makefile.
   You will be prompted to save after the new workspace has been created.

   Are you sure you want to continue?

If you click the OK button in this dialog box, you will get an application error
in Developer Studio, and Developer Studio will quit.

CAUSE
=====

If you have not directly modified the makefile (.mak file) intentionally or
unintentionally, the error may be the result of an invalid pathname that
Developer Studio has written in the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

IMPORTANT: In general, Microsoft does not support directly modifying the
makefiles that Developer Studio creates. Be sure to make a backup copy of the
makefile before attempting to make any modifications.

Open the makefile as a text file, and search for the string ".\:", or any
pathname that contains a colon (:). It may appear in a section starting with
NODEP_CPP_ or DEP_CPP_.

The colon is not a valid character in a pathname for Windows NT or Windows 95.
Remove any colons you find in a pathname. In the case of ".\:", remove the
leading backslash also, so the pathname appears as "." instead.

To open the makefile as a text file in Developer Studio, click Open on the File
menu, navigate to the directory where the makefile is located, and then select
Text in the Open As box before selecting the makefile.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 4.1.
