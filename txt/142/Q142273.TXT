TITLE   :Backing up in-use WINS Database Files Can Cause Corruption
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) service stops replicating with its
partners and the following error is logged in the system log:

   4204 - "An error was encountered in the database. You might need to restore
   the database from a backup."

CAUSE
=====

Backing up in-use WINS database files on a Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 system that is
running the WINS Server service can cause the database files to corrupt.


RESOLUTION
==========

There are two options to resolve this problem:

 - If customers wish to protect their WINS databases, use WINSADMN.EXE at the
   WINS server to enable backups. The WINS database is backed up (by the
   service) in a consistent state to a subdirectory of the user's choice. A user
   could then backup the database files from this directory.

   -or-

 - Windows NT Backup (NTBACKUP.EXE) will behave this way if Backup Files In Use
   is enabled. To disable it in NTBACKUP go into the registry under the
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree under the following subkey:

   \Software\Microsoft\Ntbackup\Backup Engine

   Make sure that the following value name is set to the following value:

      Value Name:     Backup files inuse
      Value (REG_SZ): 0


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.50 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
