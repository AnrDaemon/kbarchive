TITLE   :PRB: Corel Professional Photos CD-ROM Shows _1 After File Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Corel Professional Photos CD-ROM compact discs display _1 after all files being
read from CD-ROM drive (for example, Readme.txt_1, Setup.exe_1, and so on).

CAUSE
=====

This is a problem with Corel Professional compact discs that were compiled to
run on multi-platform machines (MAC and Windows NT Server). Windows NT is unable
to properly translate the 8.3 name standard to longfile format and as a result
displays a _1 after the extension.

RESOLUTION
==========

Corel has taken responsibility for this and has compiled a new version for use
specifically for Windows NT. Contact Corel and request an upgrade.
