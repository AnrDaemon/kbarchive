OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to use the MS-DOS UNDELETE command in Windows 95, you may receive the
following error message:

   Windows has disabled direct disk access to protect long filenames. To
   override this protection, see the LOCK /? command for more information.

   The system has been halted. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to restart your computer.

CAUSE
=====

The UNDELETE command requires direct access to the drive. You must lock the
drive before you issue the UNDELETE command.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: The UNDELETE command runs in MS-DOS mode by default. You should run these
commands in MS-DOS mode.

Lock the drive before you issue the UNDELETE command. To lock the drive, type

   lock <x>:

where <x> is the letter of the drive you want to lock.

When you are done using the UNDELETE command, unlock the drive by typing

   unlock <x>:

where <x> is the letter of the drive you want to unlock.

WARNING: Using the LOCK command enables direct disk access. A program that
accesses the disk directly can destroy long file names. You should back up long
file names before running a program that could harm them. To back up long file
names, use the Lfnbk.exe program located in the Admin\Apptools\ Lfnbk folder on
the Windows 95 CD-ROM. See the Lfnbk.txt file in the same folder for information
about this program.

The Lfnbk.exe program is included in the CD-ROM version of Windows 95, but not in
the floppy disk version. If you are using the floppy disk version of Windows 95
and you want to use Lfnbk.exe, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base for information about the availability of Lfnbk.exe:
