TITLE   :BUG: REPLACE with UDF May Cause "Record Is Not Locked" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using a user-defined function (UDF) that moves the record pointer in the
currently selected table with a REPLACE command causes a "Record is not locked"
error message. This error occurs if the buffering property is set to
2-Pessimistic record, 3-Optimistic record, or 5-Optimistic table.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the buffering property to 4-Pessimistic table. This locks the record and
updates it after issuing the TABLEUPDATE() function.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a program called Test.prg containing the following code:

      SET MULTILOCKS ON
      SET EXCLUSIVE OFF
      SET DEFAULT TO SYS(2004)+"Samples\Data"
      OPEN DATABASE Testdata
      USE Customer
      =CURSORSETPROP("Buffering",2)
      GO 5
      REPLACE maxordamt WITH mfunc()
      REPLACE maxordamt WITH mfunc()
      =TABLEUPDATE()
      =CURSORSETPROP("Buffering",1)

      FUNCTION mfunc
      ** Moves record from original position
      oldrec=IIF(EOF(),0,RECNO())
      GO 1
      tmp=maxordamt
      IF oldrec>0
         GO oldrec
      ENDIF
      RETURN tmp

2. Run the program. The error "Record is not locked" appears after encountering
   the second REPLACE command.
