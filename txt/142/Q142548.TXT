TITLE   :PRB: SelectOnEntry Property Is Ignored When KEYCOMP = DOS
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Column in a Grid has the SelectOnEntry property set to True (.T.), but when
the form is run, the text is not selected.

CAUSE
=====

The KEYCOMP setting is set to DOS. The KEYCOMP setting controls the enabling or
disabling of the SelectOnEntry property.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

If KEYCOMP = DOS is the desired default setting, issue a SET KEYCOMP TO WINDOWS
in the procedure associated with the When event of the grid and issue a SET
KEYCOMP TO DOS in the procedure associated with the Valid event of the grid.
This will allow the SelectOnEntry property to function properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Form.

2. Add a table to the Data Environment, and drag the window title of the table
   onto the form to create a grid

3. Change the ColumnCount property of the grid to 3, and ensure that each
   column's SelectOnEntry property is set to True (.T.), which is the default.

4. Save and close the form.

5. Type "SET KEYCOMP TO DOS" (without the quotation marks) in the Command
   window.

6. Run the form.

7. Move the pointer to different cells in the grid, and notice that the text
   isn't selected.

8. Type "SET KEYCOMP TO WINDOWS" (without the quotation marks) in the Command
   window.

9. Move the pointer to different cells in the grid, and notice that the text is
   selected.
