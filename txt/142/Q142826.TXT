TITLE   :BUG: DBGrid Does Not Paint Correctly When Aligned
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:4.00 | 4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a form with a bottom-aligned data control and a bottom-aligned DBGrid
control is resized vertically, the DBGrid control paints over a portion of the
data control. This same behavior occurs when a bottom-aligned picture box
replaces the data control.


RESOLUTION
==========

Add the following line of code in the form's Resize event (which is called when
the form is drawn initially and every time the form is resized):

      <name of DBGrid control>.Refresh

This causes the DBGrid control to repaint itself and not to obscure the data
control (or picture box).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching the situation and will post
more information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base when it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic, or, if it is already running, click New Project on the
   File Menu.

2. Double-click on the data control button in the Toolbox to add a data control,
   named Data1, to the project. Change the data control's Align property to '2 -
   Align Bottom'.

3. Double-click in the Toolbox, this time on the DBGrid control. Change the
   DBGrid control's Align property to '2 - Align Bottom'.

4. On the Run menu, click Start (ALT, R, S) or press F5 to run the application.

5. Drag the bottom border of the form to resize the form, and notice how the
   DBGrid control paints over the top of the data control. Adding
   DBGrid1.Refresh alleviates the problem.
