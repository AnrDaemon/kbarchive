======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A 32-bit Visual Basic application with a ListView control can generate an
application error or incorrectly display the subitems if the subitems are added
to a ListView control that is hidden on a form.

RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate this behavior, use one of the following methods:

If you want your ListView control in the form to be hidden when the form is
shown, toggle the Visible property once before adding the subitems to the
ListView control. To toggle the Visible property, initially set the Visible
property to True and then reset the Visible property to False.

-or-

At design time, set the ListView control Visible property to True. Then in the
first line of code in the form's Load procedure, set the ListView control
Visible property to False.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 5.0.

Steps to Reproduce Issue
------------------------

1. Start the 32-bit version of Visual Basic 4.0, or if it is already running,
   click New Project on the File menu.

2. Add the following controls to the Form1 form:

   1. One Check Box

   2. Two Image List Boxes

   3. One ListView Control

3. Set the Caption property of the Check box to "ListView Control Visible."

4. Copy the following code to the Code window of the Form1 form:

         Private Sub Check1_Click()

            ListView1.Visible = Check1.Value = 1

         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Load()

            'Set the ListView control's Column Headers
            Dim clmX As ColumnHeader
            Set clmX = ListView1.ColumnHeaders.Add(, , "Author", _
                       ListView1.Width / 3)
            Set clmX = ListView1.ColumnHeaders.Add(, , "Author ID", _
                       ListView1.Width / 3, lvwColumnCenter)
            Set clmX = ListView1.ColumnHeaders.Add(, , "Birthdate", _
                       ListView1.Width / 3)

            'Set the ListView control's view property to show a "Report" view
            ListView1.View = lvwReport

            'Add ListItems to the ListView control
            'Use an icon file and a bitmap file that comes with Visual Basic
             Dim imgX As ListImage
             Set imgX = ImageList1.ListImages.Add(, , LoadPicture _
                        ("C:\VB\ICONS\WRITING\NOTE06.ICO"))
             Set imgX = ImageList2.ListImages.Add(, , LoadPicture _
                        ("C:\VB\REPORT\PROLOGOB.BMP"))
             ListView1.Icons = ImageList1
             ListView1.SmallIcons = ImageList2

             Set itmX = ListView1.ListItems.Add(, , "John Doe")
             itmX.SubItems(1) = "John Dow Sub item"

         End Sub

5. Press the F5 key to run the application.

6. Click the check box. One of the following behaviors occur:

   While using Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51, the following error is
   returned:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated. VB32.exe. Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address:
   0x0523ca55.

   While using Microsoft Windows 95, the following error is returned:

   VB32 caused an invalid page fault in module COMCTL32.OCX at 0137:0523ca55.

   -or-

   The ListView control incorrectly displays the subitems.
