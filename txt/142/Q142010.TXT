TITLE   :BUG: Bad Message Appears When Promoting Domain Controllers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows NT backup domain controller is promoted to be the primary domain
controller, the following message is displayed warning that network connections
will be lost. This message is incorrect.

   Promoting SERVERNAME to Primary may take a few minutes.

   Promoting SERVERNAME will also close client connections to SERVERNAME and to
   the current domain controller (if any). Press 'Help' for details if either
   machine is a Remote Access server.

This incorrect message is displayed before a backup domain controller is
promoted. Connections and sessions established by ms network clients against
domain resources in the domain are not terminated. These clients will have full
access to existing resources and can also establish new drive/printer
connections.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft network clients that do not have sessions against the domain
controller will need to wait for the netlogon services to restart on the desired
domain controllers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
