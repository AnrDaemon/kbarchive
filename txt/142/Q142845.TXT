SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how you can add SQL Server back-end functions to *.IDC
(Internet Database Connector) files when using ODBC with the Internet Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Files with the .IDC file extension can contain SQL commands that can manipulate
an ODBC DataSource. Files with the .HTX file extension contain information that
should be presented to the browser upon completion of the .IDC file execution.

The following is an example *.IDC file called EXAMPLE.IDC. This file calls
EXAMPLE.HTX upon completion of the SQL commands:

      Datasource: ODBC DataSource
      Username: sa
      Template: example.htx
      RequiredParameters: Field1, Field2
      SQLStatement:
      +INSERT INTO Table
      +(Field1, Field2, Field3, SQLField)
      +VALUES('%Field1%', '%Field2%', '%Field3%', GETDATE());

Explanation of Fields in the Above EXAMPLE.IDC
----------------------------------------------

DataSource:

   The datasource line needs to contain the name of the ODBC data source listed
   in the Control Panel ODBC applet.

Username:

   Username is the name you use to log on to SQL Server.

Template:

   Template specifies the *.HTX file that is displayed when the query is
   successful.

RequiredParameters:

   The parameters listed after this keyword need to contain values in order for
   the *.IDC file to run.

SQLStatement:

   This contains the SQL statement as you would input it from the command line
   to the SQL Server. The only difference between this and a SQL statement is
   that each line begins with a plus sign (+).

Explanation of SQL Statement
----------------------------

INSERT INTO:

   SQL commands that insert data into a table.

Table:

   The name of the table where the data is to be placed.

Field1, Field2, Field3, SQLfield:

   These are the names of the fields where you want to place the data in the
   VALUES statement.

VALUES statement:

   These are the values the get inserted into the table "Table". These are
   obtained from the name= statements in the <form> section on the HTML
   page where the data was entered.
