TITLE   :True Type Font Corruption After Applying Service Pack 3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Service Pack 3 for Microsoft Windows NT 3.51, some True Type
fonts may not display correctly. Documents that display corrupt fonts may still
print properly.

CAUSE
=====

Code in WINSRV.DLL did not handle an entry in the font cmap table properly.


RESOLUTION
==========

Replacing WINSRV.DLL with the version that exists in Microsoft Windows NT 3.51
Service Pack 2 (or earlier Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 version) should restore
normal functionality.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A fix
to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
