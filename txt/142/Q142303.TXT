TITLE   :DNS Address from RAS Server Not Passed to RAS Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your Windows NT RAS client is configured for a server assigned IP address, but
does not get a Domain Name Service (DNS) server address from the Windows NT RAS
server.

The RAS server is configured to use DHCP to assign remote TCP/IP client
addresses. The DHCP server is configured to give out DNS server addresses. The
RAS server itself has a DNS address configured, but this address is not being
passed along to the RAS clients.

CAUSE
=====

Currently, a Windows NT RAS server that has obtained a DNS server address
through DHCP will not pass this address on to its RAS clients.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue with Windows NT version 3.51, you must manually
configure the RAS server with a DNS server address using the following steps:

1. From Control Panel double-click Network.

2. Click TCP/IP Protocol, click Configure, and click DNS.

3. Enter the DNS server address and click Close.

4. Restart the RAS Server when prompted.

To resolve this issue with Windows NT version 4.0, obtain the latest Service
Pack.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
