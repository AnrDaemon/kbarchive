SUMMARY
=======

You can automate the setup of any service by installing the service during
unattended setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install a service during unattended setup:

 - Generate an Unattend.txt file, using either the Unattend.txt file supplied
   with the Windows NT 4.0 compact disc or Setupmgr.exe from the Windows NT 4.0
   Resource Kit.

   The following example can be used to install TCP/IP, TCP/IP Printing Services,
   the Simple TCP/IP Services, and Network Monitor in an unattended mode.

         [Unattended]
         OemPreinstall = yes
         NoWaitAfterTextMode = 1
         NoWaitAfterGUIMode = 1
         FileSystem = LeaveAlone
         ExtendOEMPartition = 0
         ConfirmHardware = no
         NtUpgrade = no
         Win31Upgrade = no
         TargetPath = NTW40.US
         OverwriteOemFilesOnUpgrade = no
         KeyboardLayout =

         [UserData]
         FullName = "Admin"
         OrgName = "Test Company"
         ComputerName = C_ADMIN

         [GuiUnattended]
         OemSkipWelcome = 1
         OEMBlankAdminPassword = 1
         TimeZone = "(GMT+01:00) Paris, Madrid"

         [Display]
         ConfigureAtLogon = 0
         BitsPerPel = 8
         XResolution = 800
         YResolution = 600
         VRefresh = 60
         AutoConfirm = 1

         [Network]
         DetectAdapters = ""
         InstallProtocols = ProtocolsSection
         InstallServices = ServicesSection
         JoinDomain = domlogon
         CreateComputerAccount = domlogon\admin, password

         [ProtocolsSection]
         TC = TCParamSection

         [TCParamSection]
         DHCP = yes

         [ServicesSection]
         NETMON = InstallNetMon  <----- new section for a service to add
         STCPIP = InstallSimpleTCP  <----- new section for a service to add
         TCPPRINT = InstallTCPPrint <----- new section for a service to add

         [InstallNetMon]

         [InstallSimpleTCP]

         [InstallTCPPrint]

   In this case, the [ServicesSection] section has three particular services to
   install:

   NETMON = InstallNetMon
   STCPIP = InstallSimpleTCP
   TCPPRINT = InstallTCPPrint

   NETMON, STCPIP and TCPPRINT come from the [Options] sections of Oemnsvbh.inf,
   Oemnsvsp.inf and Oemnsvtp.inf files that are parsed to set up those services.

This successfully installs TCP/IP, TCP/IP Printing Services, the Simple TCP/IP
Services and Network Monitor in an unattended mode with this setup file.
