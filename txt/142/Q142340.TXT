KEYWORDS:kbualink97 word97 kbmergekbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a mail merge using ODBC with a Microsoft Access or Microsoft
Excel data source, the merge results for Date, Phone Number, and Currency fields
are incorrect. For example, the Date field appears in the following format:

   1995-10-22 00:00:00

The Currency field appears in the following format:

   12.00

The Phone Number field from Microsoft Access appears in the following format:

   -7081234567.00

CAUSE
=====

The data appears in its native, stored format in Microsoft Access or Microsoft
Excel. When you use DDE to convert the Microsoft Access or Microsoft Excel data
instead of ODBC, the data is "masked" to display the correct format.

RESOLUTION
==========

Method 1: Use DDE to connect to the Microsoft Access or Excel database
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To do this, select the Select Method (Confirm Conversion) check box in the Open
Data Source dialog box, locate and select your Access/Excel database, and then
click Open. In the Confirm Data Source dialog box, select Microsoft Access or
Microsoft Excel Database via DDE (*.mdb) and click OK.

NOTE: If DDE is not available, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q137076 WD: Can't Use Microsoft Access Files (.mdb or DDE) with Word

Method 2: Use MyDateFieldToLong
-------------------------------

In the Access database, type the following statement for the date column

   MyDateFieldToLong: Format([MyDateField],"Long Date")

where MyDateFieldToLong is the actual name of the field being used to label the
date column.

Method 3: Use ODBC and add a picture switch to the Date/Currency fields
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Include a numeric picture switch (\#) in the Currency field, so that the Currency
field looks like this:

   {mergefield number \# $####,0.0}

NOTE: The {mergefield number \# $####,0.0} string works for SQL Server 6 as
well.

Include a numeric picture switch (\#) in the Phone Number field, so that the
Phone Number field looks like this:

   (mergefield phone \# ###'-'###'-'####}

NOTE: The hyphen inside the mergefield is in quotation marks. Also, the quotation
marks are single quotation marks.


For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   Q121938 WD: Hyphens Don't Display Correctly with Numeric Picture Switch

Include a date-time picture switch (\@) in the Date field, so that the Date field
looks like this:

   {mergefield date \@ "MMMM d, yyyy"}

NOTE: The picture switch is case-sensitive; also, you must use quotation marks
around the picture string.
