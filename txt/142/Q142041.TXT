The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism uses a distributed
architecture for the name service by default. When an RPC client starts, it
attempts to locate the RPC server in the following order:

 - Local computer

 - Primary domain controller (PDC)

 - Backup domain controller (BDC)

 - Broadcasts to the workgroup or domain using mailslots (\MailSlot\RpcLoc_s)

This process consumes a lot of time. This article describes how to specify a
computer on the network as the default RPC name server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To specify a Windows NT Server as the default RPC name server, do the following
in the registry of the Windows NT workstation:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   Software\Microsoft\RPC\NameService

3. Change the values to the following:

   Value Name: NetworkAddress
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   String: <Server name>

   Value Name: ServerNetworkAddress
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   String: <Server name>

4. Choose OK, and quit Registry Editor.
