PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbenv kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Setup for Microsoft Office 95 on an Alpha-based platform with
Windows NT 3.51, you receive the following error message:

   Not enough memory.

   The installation cannot run with this version of Windows.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 32-bit programs will not run in Windows NT 3.51 environments on Alpha
platforms. This is because Windows NT 3.51 running on an Alpha platform emulates
the 80286 mode for those Windows programs.
