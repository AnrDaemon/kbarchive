TITLE   :NBIPX: FPNW server "NPRINT" Returns Error If Not Logged On
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you have converted and moved all your NetWare files and utilities to your
File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) server, Nprint does not work from a
DOS NetWare client. When you use Nprint to print a file, the following message
appears:

   Connection information on the destination server could not be obtained.

NOTE: If you log on to the FPNW server from a DOS NetWare client (ODI), the
NPRINT command works, but the output is incorrect.

WORKAROUND
==========

This issue can be worked around by capturing the printer prior to printing. VLM
clients are not affected by this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is by design.
