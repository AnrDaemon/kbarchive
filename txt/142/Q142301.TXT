TITLE   :IPX Routing With MPR Requires Manual Frame Type
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Multi-Protocol Router (MPR) in Windows NT Server,
Microsoft Network client computers using the IPX/SPX compatible transport
protocol are unable to communicate with the Windows NT Server.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if auto frame type detection is defined for the IPX/SPX
compatible transport protocol on all network adapters in the Windows NT Server.
In addition, if no network numbers are assigned to network devices on the server
segment, a network number of zero is assigned to all network adapters on the
Windows NT Server. Therefore, all packets are not routed properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, define a manual frame type for the IPX/SPX compatible
transport protocol and specify a unique network number for each segment in
Windows NT Server.
