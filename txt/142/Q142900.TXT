This article describes how to use WordPad and System Agent to print a document
unattended.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To schedule an unattended print job using WordPad, follow these steps:

1. Double-click the System Agent icon on the taskbar to open System Agent.

2. On the Program menu, click Schedule A New Program.

3. In the Program box, type the path for WordPad. (By default, the path is
   "C:\Program Files\Accessories\Wordpad.exe.")

   NOTE: Make sure to enclose the path in quotation marks.

4. At the end of the path to WordPad, add a space and the following entry

   /P "<path>\<filename>"

   where <path> is the path for the file to be printed and <filename>
   is the name of the file to be printed.

   For example, to print a document named Test.doc in the Docs folder, the
   Program box should contain the following line:

   "C:\Program Files\Accessories\Wordpad.exe" /P "C:\Docs\Test.doc"

5. In the Run box, click Minimized.

6. Click When To Run, and then schedule the print job.

7. Click OK, and then close System Agent.
