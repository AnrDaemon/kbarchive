TITLE   :LogonUser API Now Has Support for Network Logons
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.00 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.00 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows NT 3.51 the version of LogonUser API prevented a user from accessing
the network while the interactive or batch logon right was given to that user.

CAUSE
=====

This was due to the fact that the Logon From Network right was removed for that
user. For Windows NT 3.51, the Network logon-type support was removed, because
at the time it was deemed too confusing for the user.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem on Windows NT 3.51 Workstation or Server, obtain the fix
referenced below, or upgrade to Windows NT Workstation or Server version 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The API confusion was based on the fact that Interactive and Batch logons
allowed the logon session to go out on the net, while the Network logon would
not allow the logon session to go out on the net. However, with the exposure of
DuplicateTokenEx, this potential confusion has been documented in the Win32 SDK,
and should no longer pose an issue. The Logonuser API is called from
advapi32.dll.
