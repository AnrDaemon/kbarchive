TITLE   :PC DirSync: No Updated Address List With Multiple T2 Cycles
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2,3.2a,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If more than one T2 (Srvmain -r) cycles occur between the T1 (Reqmain -t) and T3
(Reqmain -r) times, a Config, Dirsync, Requestor Import (CDRI) request made by a
requestor may never be processed by the requestor. As a result, the addresses on
that requestor are not updated to match the Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync)
server list.

The address list also may not be processed by T3 if a T2 cycle runs between a
CDRI request and a T1 cycle.

CAUSE
=====

A CDRI request from a requestor postoffice creates a $System message to be
delivered to the Dir-Sync server. The Message Transfer Agent (MTA) delivers this
message. If a T2 process is run after the CDRI request but before the
requestor's T1 cycle is run, the Dir-Sync server will process the CDRI request.

The Dir-Sync server then submits a similar $System message containing its
complete address list back to the requestor postoffice. If T3 is not run on the
requestor, then that message is not processed. If a T1 process begins at this
point, it will submit its normal request for updates to the Dir- Sync server.
The Dir-Sync server then runs T2 again, this time only resubmitting updates
(instead of the entire address list) to the requestor in the form of another
$System message. When T3 runs, it will process the latest $System message that
it has received. So the original request for a complete list is never processed
by the requestor postoffice.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run T1, T2, and T3 cycles in order for all requestor postoffices, and avoid
running multiple T2 between any requestors T1 and T3.

If it is necessary to run multiple T2 cycles between some or all T1 and T3 times,
then perform an Import -s on the Dir-Sync server to create a RESYNC.GLB file and
copy that file to the requestor process and run a manual T3.
