TITLE   :PRB: Jetpack Failed With Error = 80
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the program Jetpack.exe to compact a WINS or DHCP database, you may
get the following message:

   Temporary database Temp.mdb already exists.
   Jetpack failed with error = 80

CAUSE
=====

You have typed in a Jetpack command line using the file name Temp.mdb for the
temporary database file, such as:

   Jetpack.exe wins.mdb temp.mdb

Jetpack.exe actually uses two temporary files to compact the database. The first
one is hardcoded as Temp.mdb, and the second one is specified on your command
line.


When Jetpack is finished, it will delete the Temp.mdb file, so you should also
make sure that you don't save any file with the name Temp.mdb in the WINS or
DHCP directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use any other file name for your temp file, as in this example:

   Jetpack.exe wins.mdb tmp.mdb

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
