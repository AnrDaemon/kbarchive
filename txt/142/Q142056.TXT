TITLE   :Slow Performance with FPNW and More than 60 Printers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you add more than 60 printers using Print Manager on a Windows NT Server
running File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW), server performance quickly
degrades. Performance Monitor shows processor utilization at a constant 100%,
while the user mode service portion of FPNW (NWSSVC.EXE) and the Windows NT
spooler (SPOOLSS.EXE) shows between 45% and 55% of the processor utilization.
Acceptable performance levels are returned if the number of printers defined is
reduced to 60 or less.

CAUSE
=====

The FPNW printing component does not scale well to large numbers of printers
(greater than 60) due to its current program design.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Server version 4.0.

The program design for the FPNW printing component has been changed for the next
release of Windows NT, removing the scaling problem.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT Server version 4.0.
