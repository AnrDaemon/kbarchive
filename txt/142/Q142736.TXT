TITLE   :PRB: RETRY Command in Method Causes Visual FoxPro to Quit
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An "ON ERROR <object>.<method>" command is used to trap for an
error. The ON ERROR command calls a method of an object. Inside the method,
RETRY will trigger a "Mismatched pushjmp/popjmp call" error, which is not listed
in the Help File. After you click OK, Visual FoxPro quits.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not call a method from an ON ERROR command. Call a program file instead.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add the following code to the form's Load event:

         ON ERROR _Screen.Activeform.Mymethod

3. Create a new method of the form called Mymethod, and type the following code
   into it:

      PUBLIC obj1
      obj1=_Screen.Activeform
      RETRY

4. Place a command button on the form, and enter the following code in its Click
   event:

      obj1.Caption="Fox"

5. Run the form, and click the command button. The Error "Mismatched'
   pushjmp/popjmp call" is triggered. Inside the help for the error is the
   message "The topic does not exist. Contact your application vendor for an
   updated Help File (129)."

6. Click OK, and Visual FoxPro quits.
