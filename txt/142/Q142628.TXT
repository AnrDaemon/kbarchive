TITLE   :Stop 0x23 Errors in Fastfat.sys
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A STOP 0x00000023 FAT_FILE_SYSTEM error message occurs when a floppy disk is
inserted or removed while Windows NT 3.51 is in the process of shutting down.

CAUSE
=====

The version of Fastfat.sys distributed with Windows NT 3.51 has the potential of
showing the above symptom. There is a very small window of time while Windows NT
is mounting a FAT volume, such as a floppy disk, during which a request to
determine whether or not it is safe to unmount the same volume may cause the
above error.

WORKAROUND
==========

Install Service Pack 5 or later for Windows NT 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
