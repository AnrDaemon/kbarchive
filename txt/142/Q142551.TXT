SYMPTOMS

Using "APPEND PROCEDURES FROM <Program File>" will append code to the
stored procedures section of a database. Unfortunately, a carriage return is not
placed between the last line of the Referential Integrity (RI) generated code
and the first line of the appended code.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use either of the following two workarounds:

 - Place a carriage return on the first line of <Program File> code.

-or-

 - After appending code to the stored procedure, open the stored procedure of
   the database, and enter the needed carriage return manually.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual
FoxPro version 3.0b for Windows.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open a database.

2. Bring up the RI builder, and do something so that it generates some code in
   the stored procedures.

3. Type the following command in the Command window:

   " APPEND PROCEDURES FROM <Program File> " (without the quotation marks)

4. Examine the stored procedures. A carriage return is not placed between the RI
   generated code and the appended code.
