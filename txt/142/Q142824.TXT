TITLE   :BUG: German Windows NT 3.51 Uses Wrong SNMP-Trap Port
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SNMP traps sent by a computer running Microsoft Windows NT will never be
received by an SNMP management system. Also an SNMP management system running on
German Windows NT never receives traps from any SNMP agent.

CAUSE
=====

There is an incorrect entry in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\Etc\Services
file, which states the port address for the SNMP-Trap is 167/udp instead of
162/udp:

   snmp-trap         167/udp    snmp

This causes the trap to be received by the NetBIOS name service, which is unable
to deal with the format of an SNMP-Packe, so it just times out.

WORKAROUND
==========

Manually change the entry to:

   snmp-trap         162/udp    snmp

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
