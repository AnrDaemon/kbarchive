TITLE   :PRB: Stacked Tabs Aren't Displayed Correctly After AddPage()

    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When CPropertySheet::AddPage() is called and a tab is too wide to fit in the
existing row of tabs, the CPropertySheet will create a new row with the new tab.
This can cause the bottom row of tabs to disappear.

NOTE: This will only occur when calling CPropertySheet::AddPage() after calling
CPropertySheet::Create or CPropertySheet::DoModal().

CAUSE
=====

The CPropertyPage and CPropertySheet are not resized when AddPage() is called.
As a result, the active CPropertyPage could cover a row of tabs and obscure it
from view.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can do either of the following:

 - Call CPropertySheet::EnableStackedTabs(FALSE) before the call to DoModal() or
   Create(). This will disable stacked tabs. When there isn't enough space to
   add a tab and AddPage() is called, a scrollbar will appear which allows you
   to scroll to the desired tab.

-or-

 - Call AddPage() for all possible pages. This will create a CPropertySheet with
   CProppertyPage items whose size will allow for the additional rows of tabs.
   If you don't want to display all of the pages initially, derive a class from
   CPropertySheet, override CPropertySheet::OnInitDialog(), and remove unwanted
   tabs by calling RemovePage().
