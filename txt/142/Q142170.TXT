SUMMARY
=======

PRPFONT shows how to set the desired font for your CPropertyPages in the
Resource Editor, and at run-time, set the sheet's font to be the same and size
everything correctly. All of this is done in a class called CMySheet. A function
called ChangeDialogFont() does the work of setting the font and resizing
windows. CPropertySheet::BuildPropPageArray() was overridden so that the fonts
in the pages are not reset.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In versions of Visual C++ earlier than 4.0, MFC had its own implementation of
CPropertySheet. You could set the font for your CPropertySheet by setting the
font of your first CPropertyPage dialog box resource in the Resource Editor. At
run time, the sheet would use the font that you set and size everything
according to the font. Starting with Visual C++ 4.0, MFC uses the Windows 95
PropertySheet control. This control will always use the system font for the
sheet. This is by design. MFC will also force the pages to use the same font as
the sheet. This is done in a function called BuildPropPageArray(). Because this
is an undocumented function, it may change or be deleted in future versions of
MFC.

CMySheet will use the font of the first active CPropertyPage to set the font and
size of the CPropertySheet and its child windows. The CPropertyPages will appear
with the font specified in the resource editor.
