TITLE   :XCLN: Display of Public Folder Summary Causes Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user of the Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows 3.x , Windows NT, or
Windows 95 attempts to view the Folder contacts of a migrated public folder, it
is likely that this field will display unreadable text. In addition, an Access
Violation might occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Folder contacts field is displayed by clicking a public folder, the File
menu, the Properties option, and then the Summary tab.

CAUSE
=====

Public Folders migrated using the Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard, set the
System Attendant to be the owner of the folder by default. The System Attendant
does not have a display name and this creates a problem for the client when it
builds the Folder contacts window. Normally, the folder owner name would be
visible when viewing the Folder contacts in the summary tab of the folders
properties.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft
Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
