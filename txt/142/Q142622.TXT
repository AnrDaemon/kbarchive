TITLE   :Repeated Automatic Logons in Windows NT May Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT has an auto-logon feature that allows an administrator to enter a
user name and password in the Registry. After a very large number of repeated
logon and logoff attempts, a logon attempt may eventually fail. Attempting to
change the password for this user at this time may also fail.

CAUSE
=====

When a user logs on to Windows NT, Windows NT takes the unencrypted password
that the administrator set in the Registry for the auto-logon and uses it to log
the specified user onto the workstation. A problem has been found when a large
number of successive logon attempts occurs.

For additional information on the Windows NT auto-logon feature, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q97597
   TITLE : How to Enable Automatic Logon in Windows NT


WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem on Windows NT 3.51 Workstation or Server, install
Service Pack 5 or later, or upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server version
4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
