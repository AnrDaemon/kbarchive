-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Moverlist boxes are designed to allow for easy point selection of a value that
will display in a parallel list box enabling the user to create a list of items
before proceeding. The code involved to make these list boxes work properly is
very extensive in the Microsoft Visual FoxPro product. In the
Vfp\Samples\Controls\Samples.vcx directory, you'll find a Mover Class that you
can use to quickly create moverlist boxes with very little additional code. The
example given in this article works for most, if not all, users.

================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a Visual FoxPro session.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Controls tab.

3. Make sure the Visual Class Libraries option is selected, and then click Add,
   and select the following library:

      Vfp\Samples\Controls\Samples.vcx

   Samples should appear in the Selected box of the Options Dialog Box,

4. Click Set As Default, then click OK.

5. On the system's File menu, click New, click Form, and click New File. A blank
   form will appear.

6. Click the View Classes Button on the Forms Control Tool Bar, and select
   Samples. The Forms Control Tool Bar has now changed.

7. Click the Moverlists Button, click in the form, and the moverlists will
   appear.

8. Place the table that you intend to get the list value(s) from in the Data
   Environment of the form.

9. Place the following code in the Init event of the form:

       SELECT <TABLENAME>
       SCAN
          THIS.MOVERLISTS1.LSTSOURCE.ADDLISTITEM(<FIELDNAME>)
       ENDSCAN

At this point, you can add any additional buttons, controls, or code depending on
what the user would like the list boxes to do.

Steps to Add Selected Items to a Database
-----------------------------------------

If you want to add the selected values to a .dbf file, follow these steps:

1. Add the .dbf table to Data Environment of the form.

2. Add a Command Button, and place the following code in its Click Event:

      SELECT <NEWTABLENAME>
      FOR I = 1 TO THIS.PARENT.MOVERLISTS1.LSTSELECTED.LISTCOUNT
         APPEND BLANK
         REPLACE <FIELDNAME> WITH ;
            THIS.PARENT.MOVERLISTS1.LSTSELECTED.LISTITEM(I)
      ENDFOR

   The records that were selected have now been written to the table of your
   choice.

3. To immediately see the results of the APPEND command, add:

      BROWSE
