TITLE   :PRB: Event Log Does Not Resize Without Clearing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to change the system log file size, the change may not seem to
take effect.

For instance, with overwrites turned off, if the log filled up at the default
size of 512K and the maximum size is changed to 1024K, messages will still
appear, warning that the log is full. Alternatively, if the maximum log size
setting is decreased, the real log size does not change.

CAUSE
=====

Increasing or decreasing the maximum log size doesn't take effect until the log
is cleared.

RESOLUTION
==========

Archive the log if you want to keep the log details. Then clear the log to allow
the new size to take effect.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
