TITLE   :FIX: CTL3D32.DLL Errors with Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bFIX

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Visual FoxPro 3.0 under Windows 95, the following error may
occur:

   This application uses CTL3D32.DLL, which is not the correct version. This
   version of CTL3D32.DLL is designated only for Windows NT systems.

CAUSE
=====

This does not occur with all Windows 95 installations. At this time, Microsoft
has not isolated a cause for this problem, but it is suspected that certain
system configurations, combined with Visual FoxPro, cause confusion.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in version 3.0b.
The easiest workaround is to expand the file in question from the cab file on
the disk. For example, if the Visual FoxPro CD is in drive D, the command would
be:

      EXTRACT D:\VFP9.CAB /L C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\CTL3D32.DLL

Additional query words: CTL3D32 DLL
