======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 96 World Atlas for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt Encarta World Atlas Setup on a computer using a NexGen Central
Processing Unit (CPU), the installation fails and you receive the error
message:

   Encarta 96 World Atlas requires a 486 DX/25 or faster processor.

After you click OK, the following message appears:

   Encarta 96 World Atlas Setup was not completed successfully.

Click OK and the installation quits.

You can complete a manual installation process. However, when you create and then
click the World Atlas icon, the following error message appears:

   Encarta 96 World Atlas requires a 486 DX/33 or faster processor.

When you click OK the process aborts.

CAUSE
=====

Before starting the installation process, Encarta 96 World Atlas checks for the
processor type. If the CPU type is determined to be a NexGen, the installation
process fails.


RESOLUTION
==========


NexGen has created the Windows CPU Identifer utility to properly identify the
Nx586 processor. Running this utility prior to starting an application allows
the application to obtain the correct processor type. This utility is included
in the NexGen Tool Kits and Update Kits. Tool Kits are provided with every
motherboard and processor. Update Kits can be downloaded from the NexGen online
service. There are two versions of the kits: PCI and VL. The first letter
identifies the bus type: P=PCI, V=VL.

   Update Kit File Names
      PCI Update Kit:  updtpixx.exe
       VL Update Kit:  updtvlxx.exe

   (where xx is the latest version number)

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have a BIOS version number lower than the following BIOS version
numbers:

   PCI Board:  p06w034n
    VL Board:  v06d033w

you need to obtain a flash bios upgrade from NexGen. Flash BIOS updates are
included in the NexGen Update Kits.

To obtain the Update Kits and for more information on the NexGen CPU, contact
NexGen at the following locations:

The following products have been known to identify the Nx586 processor as an
80386:

 - Encarta 96 World Atlas

 - Hover

NOTE: Any program that requires a 486 or greater and checks the chip for
confirmation also share this problem.

If My Computer properties is checked, Windows 95 reports it is running on a 80386
processor.
