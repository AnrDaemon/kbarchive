SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the word processing program in Encarta 1994 or 1995
for the Macintosh, you receive the following error message:

   Encarta is unable to start your word processor correctly. Please see the Word
   Processor section of the Encarta Readme file for information and
   troubleshooting tips."

The error message may indicate insufficient system memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To free additional memory, close any other open programs. If there are no other
open programs, reduce the memory required by Encarta or the word processing
program.

To reduce the memory required by Encarta do the following:

1. Close Encarta.

2. Click the Encarta icon.

3. Click the File menu, then click Get Info.

4. In the Memory Requirements dialog box, change the Preferred size setting to
   the Minimum size.

   NOTE: The Preferred size setting can not be less than the Minimum size.

5. Close the Get Info box.

Then after you reduce the memory requirements for Encarta, click the Apple menu
and click About This Macintosh. If the Largest Unused Block setting is greater
than the preferred size for Encarta and the word processing program combined,
the word processing program will start.

If the Largest Unused Block setting is smaller than the sum of the Preferred Size
for both Encarta and the word processing program, you need to reduce system
memory requirements.

For information on reducing system memory requirements contact Apple technical
support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The minimum system memory requirement for Encarta is between 4 and 5 Megabytes
(MB) RAM (depending on the version).

Computers running System 7.5 can use Extensions Manager to turn off unnecessary
extensions and gain system memory.

Extensions needed to run Encarta:

 - Apple CD-ROM

   For external CD-ROM drives consult the user's manual for needed extensions.

 - QuickTime

 - QuickTime Powerplug for Power Macintosh users

 - QuickTime Musical Instruments (Encarta 96 and 97 only)
