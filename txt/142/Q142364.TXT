SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to obtain an instrument definition file (IDF) editor
so you can customize or create an IDF for a MIDI instrument.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An IDF editor is included with the Microsoft Windows 95 Software Development Kit
(SDK). For information about obtaining the Windows 95 SDK, please contact the
Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) at (800) 426-9400


Note that this program is provided "as is" and is not supported by Microsoft
Support Engineers.

IDF files contain information about instrument patch (sound) maps and additional
instrument-specific information. IDF files are binary files and are not editable
without the IDF editor.

Windows 95 includes a General.idf file for compatibility with all general MIDI
instruments. If a MIDI instrument is not general-MIDI-compatible, or has
capabilities beyond the general MIDI specification, a custom IDF file must be
created to use the instrument.
