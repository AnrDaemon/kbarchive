OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to add a printer port in Print Manager that has a comma in the
port name, the following error message appears:

   Could not set printer: The specified port is unknown.

CAUSE
=====

Currently, Windows NT does not support the use of comma's in port names. NT Uses
comma's for separators, thus they are not valid for printer names or port names.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, rename and remove the comma in the port name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
