SYMPTOMS
========

When you run SETUP.EXE for Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer on a
Windows NT computer, the following dialog box may appear when the Electronic
Forms Designer Setup program tries to restart Windows NT:

   Installation Microsoft

   This Windows application cannot respond to the End Task request. It may be
   busy, waiting for a response from you or may have stopped executing.

   Select Cancel to return to Windows NT.

   Select End Task to close this application immediately. You will lose any
   unsaved information in this application.

   Select Wait to give the application 5 seconds to finish what it is doing and
   then try to close the application again

   [WAIT] [END TASK] [CANCEL]

CAUSE
=====

This is fairly typical of some 16-bit application setups on Windows NT. The
system merely has not given the setup routine enough time to shut down.
Selecting the Wait button on the shut down dialog box will enable the setup
routine to complete its shut down process.
