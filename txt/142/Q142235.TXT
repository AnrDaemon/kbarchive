======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you connect to a password-protected network share and elect not to save
the password in the password list, you can reconnect to the share without being
prompted for the password after you disconnect from the share or close the UNC
connection.

CAUSE
=====

The password is stored in memory after the connection is established the first
time.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restart your computer, or log on again (by clicking Shut Down on the Start menu,
and then clicking "Close all programs and log on as a different user"). This
causes the password to be required before you can reconnect to the share.
