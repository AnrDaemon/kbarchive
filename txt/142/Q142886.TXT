======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Error #109 "Record is in use by another user" is activated when you try to edit
a field in a grid. The grid has both child and grandchild fields with Buffering
set to Optimistic Table Buffering (5) on the grandchild table, and the form is
using a Private Data Session.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in FoxPro 3.0b for
Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Add three tables to the form's data environment and set a 1:1 relation from
   first table to the second and from the second to the third.

2. Set the BufferModeOverride property to 5 for the third table.

3. Create a text box for the first table.

4. Add navigation buttons that will move the record pointer in the first table
   and refresh the form.

5. Create a grid by dragging the second table to the form.

6. Set the ColumnCount of the grid to 3.

7. Set the ControlSource of Column3 to a field from the third table.

8. Set the DataSession property of the form to 2-Private Data Session.

9. Run the form, and select a parent record with many records in the grid.

10. Try to edit two or three child records by changing data in the child and
   grandchild. At this point, you'll receive the error.
