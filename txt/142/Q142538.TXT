TITLE   :PRB: M6110 Run-Time Error Occurs When Using SYSTEMQQ or RUNQQ
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortran

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An application that uses either the SYSTEMQQ or RUNQQ run-time functions without
specifying the proper include files causes this run-time error:

   run-time error: M6110 MATH
   - floating-point error: stack overflow

CAUSE
=====

The definitions for the SYSTEMQQ and RUNQQ functions are not found and are
incorrectly interpreted by the compiler. The definitions of the two functions
are located in the Flib.fi and Flib.fd include files under Microsoft FORTRAN
PowerStation versions 1.0 and 1.0a for MS-DOS and Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation
32 version 1.0 for Windows NT. If you are using Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation
32 version 4.0, the function definitions are located in the MSFLIB module.

RESOLUTION
==========

When using Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation versions 1.0 and 1.0a for MS-DOS or
Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation 32 version 1.0 for Windows NT, specify the
Flib.fi and Flib.fd include files in the appropriate places. Under Microsoft
FORTRAN PowerStation 32 version 4.0, place the "USE MSFLIB" statement at the
beginning of the program unit that references either of these functions.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code Demonstrating Behavior
----------------------------------

   C  Compile options needed: none

   C  Running the code below causes the M6110 run-time error.
         nResult = SYSTEMQQ("DIR")
         END

Sample Code Demonstrating Solution
----------------------------------

The following code demonstrates the solution using Microsoft PowerStation
versions 1.0 and 1.0a for MS-DOS and Microsoft PowerStation 32 version 1.0 for
Windows NT.

   C Compile options needed: none

   C The proper include files are specified and correctly referenced
         INCLUDE "FLIB.FI"
         INCLUDE "FLIB.FD"
         LOGICAL nResult
         nResult = SYSTEMQQ("DIR")
         END

Sample Code Demonstrating Solution for FORTRAN PowerStation 32 4.0
------------------------------------------------------------------

Under Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation 32 version 4.0 using the statement "USE
MSFLIB" causes the "SYSTEMQQ" function definition to be referenced correctly.
The following code illustrates this:

   C Compile options needed: none
         USE MSFLIB   ! Commenting this line causes the run-time error
         LOGICAL nResult
         nResult = SYSTEMQQ("DIR")
         END
