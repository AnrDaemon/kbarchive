TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Create a Quick Report/Wizard Report from a Cursor
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Cursors based on tables that are part of a database and cursors based on free
tables whose select statements include "where" clauses cannot be used to create
a Quick Report or a Wizard-generated Report based on that cursor.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. Microsoft FoxPro version 2.6 allowed you to create a
Quick Report or a Wizard-generated Report based on a cursor. In Microsoft Visual
FoxPro this functionality is still available if the table from which the cursor
was created is not part of a database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Demonstrate Behavior
-----------------------------

The following procedure demonstrates that under certain conditions, a cursor
cannot be used to create a Quick Report or a Wizard-generated Report in Visual
FoxPro.

1. Open or switch to Microsoft Visual FoxPro.

2. Open a free table (one that is not part of a database), and type the
   following command in the Command window -- where <TableName> is the
   name of the free table:

      SELECT * FROM <TableName> INTO CURSOR MyCursor

3. On the Tools Menu, click Wizards - Report. Then in the Wizard Selection
   dialog box, click Report Wizard, and then click OK.

4. Note that the cursor MYCURSOR is listed in the Databases/Tables list box and
   is therefore available for the creation of the report. Click Cancel, and then
   close the table and the cursor.

5. Open a table that is part of a database, and type the following command in
   the Command window -- where <TableName> is the name of the table you
   just opened:

      SELECT * FROM <TableName> INTO CURSOR MyCursor

6. On the Tools Menu, click Wizards - Report. Then in the Wizard Selection
   dialog box, click Report Wizard, and then click OK.

7. Note that the cursor MyCursor is not listed in the Databases/Tables list box
   and is therefore not available for the creation of the report. Click Cancel,
   and then close the table and the cursor.

8. Open a free table and type in the following command in the Command window:

         SELECT * FROM <TableName> INTO CURSOR MyCursor where ;
            fieldname="some variable"

9. On the Tools menu, click Wizards-Report. Then in the Wizard Selection dialog
   box, click Report Wizard, and then click OK.

10. Note that the cursor MyCursor is not listed in the Databases/Tables list box
   and is therefore not available for the creation of the report. Click Cancel,
   and then close the table and the cursor.
