TITLE   :FPNW Options Are Not Available Under User Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) on a Windows NT
Standalone Server, not a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or a Backup Domain
Controller (BDC), that is a member of a Domain, while logged into the Domain,
you may not see the FPNW Service Account, the Supervisor account, or the options
for FPNW under the User Properties.

CAUSE
=====

You may not see the FPNW options in User Manager on a Standalone Server when you
are logged into the Domain from the Server because the focus of User Manager is
the Domain Accounts Database. This should happen only if FPNW is not installed
on the Domain. When using User Manager while logged into the Domain from a
Standalone Server the focus of the utility is the Domain, not the Server. The
Domain and the Stand-alone Server have separate accounts databases. How you are
logged into the Server (Domain Account or Local Account) determines which
database you are administering.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the account is a Domain account, you should log in to the Domain. If the
account is local to the Server, you can log in locally to administer it.

Alternatively, to administer the local account database while you are logged in
to the domain, run User Manager for Domain, choose Select Domain... from the
User menu and enter the local machine name instead of a domain name (eg.
\\mysrvr). This shows the local database instead of the domain accounts
database. The latter is the better method if you want to grant FPNW access to
domain accounts, which is not possible if you are logged in locally and not
validated in the domain.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
