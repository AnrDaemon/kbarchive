SYMPTOMS
========

Some edit fields in Visual C++ may become blank when they are selected for
editing. The fields that have this problem are grid edit controls. This can be
demonstrated in Visual C++ version 2.0 when using the Version Information
editor. Additionally, Visual C++ 4.0 uses grid edit controls in the Variables
and Watch editors in the debugger.

CAUSE
=====

The problem only occurs on Computers running Windows NT 3.5 or later and appears
when the display settings have the font size set to large fonts.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the display font size to small font to allow proper editing of version
information resources. The font size setting can be changed from the Display
applet in the Control Panel.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 4.1.
