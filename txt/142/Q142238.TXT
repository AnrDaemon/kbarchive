TITLE   :BUG: Setup /AUTO Fails to Install 32-bit ODBC on Windows NT
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSDKODBC kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG#: 3191 (ODBCSDK2)

SYMPTOMS
========

The setup program provided in the ODBC SDK 2.10a fails to install the 32-bit
ODBC components on Windows NT when the /AUTO switch is used.

WORKAROUND
==========

 - You can modify the setup program by calling SQLConfigDataSource after
   SQLInstallODBC. For more details on SQLConfigDataSource, please refer to
   Chapter 24, Installer DLL Function Reference, of the "ODBC 2.0 Programmer's
   Reference and SDK Guide."

 - You can use SQLWritePrivateProfileString, a macro call that calls
   WritePrivateProfileString in the Windows API, to write a value name and data
   to the ODBC.INI subkey of the registry. For more details on
   SQLWritePrivateProfileString, please refer to Chapter 24, Installer DLL
   Function Reference, of the "ODBC 2.0 Programmer's Reference and SDK Guide."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the ODBC 2.10a SDK. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Driver Setup Toolkit is included with the ODBC SDK to give developers an
easy way to include a customized setup program with their deliverable database
drivers. The toolkit is located in the \ODBCSDK\DRVSETUP.KIT directory and is
specifically designed to enable developers to customize an ODBC-compatible
driver setup program.

The driver setup program supports automatic setup. This is useful for multi- user
environments, where users can set up drivers from a network drive; automatic
setup provides all users with the same ODBC drivers and data sources. To setup
automatically, users run the setup program with the /AUTO switch.

For more details, please refer to Chapter 6, Using the Driver Setup Toolkit, of
the "ODBC 2.0 Programmers Reference and SDK Guide."

The following is an excerpt from the ODBC SDK 2.10 release notes:

Chapter 6: Using the Driver Setup Toolkit (Problems and Information)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

"Setup /AUTO works on Windows NT as well. However, on Windows NT, you cannot
configure a standalone system first and get a copy of the ODBC.INI and
ODBCINST.INI files, as the information for 32-bit setup is in the registry. (See
step 4 in "To configure a system for automatic setup, the network
administrator.") You must manually create these files for network installation
on Windows NT workstations. The file format for ODBC.INI is described in the
ODBC 2.0 Programmer's Reference. The file format for the ODBCINST.INI file is
the same for both 16-bit and 32-bit drivers."

However, when you manually create ODBC.INI and ODBCINST.INI files and run
Setup.exe, you will encounter the following error:

   Setup is unable to install ODBC.
   C:\~SMPLSTP.T\ODBCINST.INI is either empty or missing.

Actually, Setup.exe creates a temporary directory: C:\~SMPLSTP.T and ODBCINST.INI
does exist in that directory.

Note that Setup /AUTO has been tested on Windows 95 and does not work on this
operating system either.
