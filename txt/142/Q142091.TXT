TITLE   :XCLN: No E-form When Sent from a Public Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you read an electronic form that was created using the Microsoft Exchange,
version 4.0, Electronic Forms Designer, the following message can appear in the
message body as a standard mail message in the recipient's Inbox:

   Correctly displaying this item requires a custom form that is either not
   available or not correctly installed. Please see you network manager for more
   information.

CAUSE
=====

One reason that the form can not be run is because the send form was only
installed to a public folder. The Exchange client will search only the default
send form locations (Inbox and Enterprise forms registry). However, the Exchange
client will search all available public folders for post forms.

WORKAROUND
==========

To be able to run the form, drag or copy the message to the public folder where
the form is installed, or install the folder to the Organization forms library
or local folder (mailbox or .PST).

You can create a Send form from a Post form by using the Electronic Forms
Designer. This is the recommended solution for Exchange forms managers who wish
to install send forms to a public folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information regarding this procedure, please see Chapter 12 of
the "Application Designer's Guide" for Microsoft Exchange.
