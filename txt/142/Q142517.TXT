SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic does not support Administrator or Network setup. If your computer
has a shared Windows 3.10 or Windows 95 installation, you can set up Visual
Basic only if you have write privileges to the network system directory. The
Visual Basic files can be installed to the local hard drive or a private network
share.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because Visual Basic doesn't support Administrator or Network setup, Microsoft
Technical Support does not provide support for Visual Basic installed or running
from a network.

Additional query words: unsupported
