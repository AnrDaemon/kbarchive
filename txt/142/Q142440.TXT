 - Microsoft Music Central for Windows 1996 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you download the Music Central 1996 and Cinemania 1996 Monthly Update Files
and start either program, the integration process displays the following
informational message:

   Integrating Update files. Please Wait...

This message reappears when you click the option below for the program you are
using:

Music Central 1996
------------------

   On the Find drop down menu, click Albums.

Cinemania 1996
--------------

   On the Find drop down menu, click Movies.

CAUSE
=====

The first integration session message indicates the program is establishing
application links. When you click Albums or Movies, the integration message
appears a second time indicating the program is decoding the actual text and
pictures.

STATUS

This behavior is by design.
