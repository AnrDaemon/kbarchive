TITLE   :NetWare FLAG and FLAGDIR Commands Do Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Novell NetWare FLAG and FLAGDIR commands may not change the attributes of
files and folders.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the NetWare FLAG and FLAGDIR commands are being used
on a Windows 95-based computer with the File and Printer Sharing for NetWare
Networks service enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior is by design. These commands are not supported on Windows 95-based
computers acting as NetWare servers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Windows 95-based computer can appear to be a NetWare server when the File and
Print Sharing for NetWare Networks service is enabled.

The FLAG and FLAGDIR commands are used to change file or folder attributes. These
fall under NetWare's attribute security, which is most commonly used to
restrict:

 - Copying a file

 - Deleting a file

 - Viewing a file or folder
