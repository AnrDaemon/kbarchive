TITLE   :License Manager Purchase History Lost Promoting BDC to PDC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the role of a Backup domain controller to Primary you may lose
the Purchase History if the current primary cannot be contacted.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, copy %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\CPL.CFG from the former
PDC to the new PDC and restart License Manager.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server versions 3.51
and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Licensing information for each domain is stored in the CPL.CFG file on the PDC.
This information is replicated up to the PDC. When a BDC is promoted and the
License Manager is started, it creates a new CPL.CFG if one does not exist. In
this case, the purchase history will have to be reentered.
