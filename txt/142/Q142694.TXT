The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When initializing certain Cyrix processors, Windows NT 4.0 will disable the CPU
write-back cache to prevent serious system problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Certain Cyrix processors are known to cause serious problems with Windows NT
4.0.


If Windows NT detects certain Cyrix processor steppings, it will disable the L1
w/b (write-back) cache.

This will reduce performance but will guard against systemwide problems caused by
the write-back cache, thus preventing data-loss.

The Cyrix products discussed here are manufactured by Cyrix Corporation, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
