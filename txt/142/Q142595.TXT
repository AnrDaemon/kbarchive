SUMMARY
=======

When you start Windows 95 from a Server-Based-Setup (SBS) shared installation on
a Microsoft Windows NT server, two separate logons are required: a real-mode
network logon and a protected-mode network logon in Windows 95. There are 2
methods you can use to automate these logons:

 - To bypass the protected-mode logon, log on in real-mode with your domain user
   name and domain password.

 - To bypass the real-mode logon, add the following line to the Autoexec.bat
   file in the root directory of drive C

         net logon <generic_username> <password> /domain:<domain name> /y

   where <generic_username> is a generic account that you have created with
   <password> as its password. This causes a generic logon in real mode.
   You can then log on with your normal user account when you are prompted in
   protected mode (in Windows 95).

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the second method above, you must make sure that your shared
installation is not located on any primary or backup domain controllers. If the
shared installation is located on a primary or backup domain controller, you
will be able to use the generic logon in real mode successfully, but you will
not be able to log on in Windows 95. You will receive the following error
message:

   The domain password you supplied is not correct, or access to your logon
   server has been denied.

The shared installation must not reside on a primary or backup domain controller
for this method to work correctly.
