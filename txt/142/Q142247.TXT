OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnokeyword kbide kbVBp400bug kbVBp500fix kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Printing a large 32-bit Visual Basic project under the Windows NT 3.51 operating
system generates an application error that closes Visual Basic. This behavior
occurs if the Visual Basic program is running under the Windows NT 3.51
operating system whether you print the project to a printer or a file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To print a large Visual Basic project from Windows NT 3.51, print the sections
individually rather than as one large piece.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual Basic
version 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION

Step to Reproduce Behavior
--------------------------

1. Start the 32-bit version of the Visual Basic 4.0 under the Window NT 3.51
   operating system or if it is already running, click New Project on the File
   menu.

2. Load the Visdata project located in the \Program Files\Microsoft Visual
