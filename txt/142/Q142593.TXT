SYMPTOMS
========

The Sysincl.dat and Msvcincl.dat files are used to exclude header files from
being set as a dependency in Visual C++ projects. However, if the header file is
located in the same directory as the project, the file will be included as a
dependency.

RESOLUTION
==========

Move the header file to another directory to work around the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
