SUMMARY
=======

In Visual FoxPro, you can create an engraved effect around a command group of
command buttons on a form. This article demonstrates how to emulate the same
engraved look any place on a form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

The following steps create a form with a group of command buttons on the form to
demonstrate the engraved look. Then a single command button is placed on the
form with a shape to achieve an identical effect.

1. Create a new form, and change its BackColor property to light gray:
   192,192,192.

2. From the Format menu, clear the Snap to Grid check box.

3. Place a command group on the form, and change its BackStyle property to 0 -
   Transparent. Ensure that the SpecialEffect property is set to 0 - 3D, and the
   BorderStyle property is set to 1 - Fixed Single. This shows the engraved
   effect around the command group.

4. Place a command button on the form.

5. Place a Shape object on the form from outside the top-left corner of the
   command button to outside the bottom-right corner of the command button. The
   goal is to make the Shape slightly larger than the command button.

6. Change the BackStyle property of the Shape to 0 - Transparent and its
   SpecialEffect property to 0 - 3D. Ensure that the BorderColor property is
   black: 0,0,0. Also ensure that the BorderWidth property is 1.

7. With Shape1 as the selected object on the form, click Send to Back on the
   Format menu. Because the Shape object was placed on the form after the
   command button, the Shape is actually be on top of the command button unless
   this step has been taken. If the Shape is left on top of the command button,
   you wouldn't be able to click the command button when the form is run.
