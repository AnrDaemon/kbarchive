The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install or remove Norton Utilities for Windows 95, Norton AntiVirus
for Windows 95, or Norton Navigator, you may receive the following error message
when you restart Windows 95:

   Error loading C:\Windows\System\Setup.exe.
   You must reinstall Windows.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur when Symantec's installation program cannot change
the Windows 95 shell to Windows Explorer after installing or removing a program.
Symantec Technical Support has confirmed that this problem occurs when a
System.in_ file is present in the Windows folder.


RESOLUTION
==========

Follow these steps to set Windows Explorer as the Windows 95 shell:

1. Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
   the F8 key, and then choose Command Prompt Only.

2. Use any text editor (such as Edit.com) to open the System.ini file in the
   Windows folder. To use Edit.com, type the following line:

   " edit c:\windows\system.ini " (without the quotation marks)

3. Change the line that reads

   Shell=C:\Windows\System\Setup.exe

   to:

   Shell=Explorer.exe

4. Save the System.ini file and then close the editor.

5. Restart your computer.

To prevent the problem from reoccurring, delete or rename the System.in_ file in
the Windows folder.
