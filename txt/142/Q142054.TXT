-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are auditing the print jobs as they are processed through the Event
viewer, the Print Job/Document number resets every time it reaches 255 in
Windows NT 3.51. In previous versions, this number did not reset and continued
to increase.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows NT 3.5, print job auditing is accomplished by viewing the document
number in Event ID 10 in the Event Viewer. This system event also provides
information about the user who printed the file, the size of the print job and
the printer or port name. The Print Job/Document number does not reset unless
you clear the event log or reboot the computer.
