PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT Resource Kit tool Shutdown.exe to shut down a REMOTE
computer running a Windows NT screensaver, the screensaver does not reactivate
on the REMOTE computer if the shutdown process is ended by using the following
command:

   shutdown \\<remote_Windows_NT_computer> /a

CAUSE
=====

Shutdown.exe temporarily disabled the Windows NT screensaver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To reactivate the screensaver settings on the REMOTE computer, restart Windows
NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. On the REMOTE computer running Windows NT, select screensaver in Control
   Panel Desktop.

2. Allow the screensaver to kick in on the REMOTE computer.

3. On the LOCAL computer running Windows NT, type the following in a command
   prompt:

   "shutdown \\<remote_Windows_NT_computer> /t:<time in number of
   seconds>" (without the quotation marks)

   On the REMOTE computer, a System Shutdown window will pop up while the
   screensaver still runs in the background.

4. On the LOCAL computer, type the following in a command prompt before the
   REMOTE computer shuts down:

   "shutdown \\<remote_Windows_NT_computer> /a" (without the quotation
   marks)

   This command will stop the shutdown process on the REMOTE computer, and the
   display will revert to the selected screensaver.

5. On the REMOTE computer, stop the screensaver by moving the mouse. A blank
   screen or a bit-map screen will appear on the REMOTE computer.

6. On the REMOTE computer, press the CTRL+ALT+DEL keys simultaneously. A Windows
   NT Security window will appear on the REMOTE computer. At this point,
   selecting either the Task List or Cancel option on the REMOTE computer will
   return control to Program Manager. At this point, the screensaver for the
   REMOTE computer, does not kick back in after the specified time expires.
