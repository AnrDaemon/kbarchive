PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows for Workgroup client sends a print job to Windows NT print queue
servicing an Apple IIG or a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4, no output may be
seen or an error may print on the print job.

CAUSE
=====

Windows for Workgroups sends a CTRL-D at the beginning of the print job. Some
printers such as the Apple IIG and the HP LaserJet 4 do not recognize the CTRL-D
at the beginning of the print job.

RESOLUTION
==========

To workaround this issue, choose another printer to print from the Windows for
Workgroup client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
