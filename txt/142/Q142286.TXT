PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the GETPEM() function to return any property, event, or method from any
object contained within a class will result in cryptic characters if that
property, event, or method has been populated within the finished form.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The GETPEM() function is new to Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 3.0b. GETPEM()
requires two arguments. The first argument should refer to either the object or
class that contains the property, event, or method. The second argument should
refer to the property, event, or method.

For more information about the GETPEM() function, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q141632 GETPEM Function Doesn't Work on Object Contained in Class

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form, and place a command button on it.

2. On the File menu, click Save as Class. In the Name field, enter "pemclass"
   (without the quotation marks) and in the File field, enter "Test" (without
   the quotation marks).

3. Exit the Form Designer. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the
   Forms tab. Under Template Classes, select the Form check box and locate the
   Test.vcx file. Highlight it, and click OK. Click the OK button on the Options
   page to save the change.

4. Create a new form, and note that the pemclass is now the template. In the
   Click event of the command button, add this code:

      ThisForm.Release

5. Save the form as pemform. Then close it, and use the DO FORM command to run
   the form.

6. On the Tools menu, click Debug Window. Resize it so that there is sufficient
   area on both sides.

7. In the left side of the Debug window, type:

      GETPEM(_Screen.ActiveForm.Command1,"Click")

On the right side of the Debug window, you will see that cryptic characters are
displayed when what is expected is that the Click event code, "ThisForm.Release"
of the command button is displayed.
