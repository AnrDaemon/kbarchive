TITLE   :Remote Control Fails Over IPX Token-Ring Wide Area Network
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An ACC Nile router (with no filtering) is running IPX over a token-ring network
(a non-NetWare network). Both a Systems Management Server and a Windows for
Workgroups computer are using the IPX/SPX compatible transport protocol (NWLink)
to communicate. However, if a Windows for Workgroups computer is not on the same
ring as the Systems Management Server, remote control does not work. The Windows
for Workgroups computer can properly connect to computers on the same, far side
of the router, but cannot connect to computers across the router.

NOTE: Although this article mentions an ACC Nile router running IPX over token
ring, this symptom also applies to other routers.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Windows for Workgroups computer is not
responding to the NBIPX Find Name requests sent by the Systems Management Server
across the router. The Systems Management Server is not able to remote control
or connect to the Windows for Workgroups computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use an ACC Nile router command that changes the IPX
network functional address to FFFFFFFFFFFF from the default token-ring address
of C00000800000. The default address that the router port uses to send IPX
broadcast packets in an ethernet network is FFFFFFFFFFFF.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On the same side of the router, the Systems Management Server sends a request
packet using the MAC destination address of FFFFFFFFFFFF to a Windows for
Workgroups computer. However, the Systems Management Server across the router
sends the MAC destination address of C00000800000, which the Windows for
Workgroups computer on the other side of the router ignores. A Windows 95
computer accepts either one of addresses.
