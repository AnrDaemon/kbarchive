SUMMARY
=======

After you copy a directory with read-only attributes and the files in the
directory from a Windows NT computer to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LM/X computer,
share the directory and attempt to copy additional files to the directory, the
following error message appears:

   Access is Denied, ignore: <Drive>:<Path><Directory name>

   You do not have permission or the file is in use. Choose yes to ignore this
   file and continue operation.

If you copy files from the HP LM/X computer to the shared directory with
read-only attributes on the Windows NT computer, no error message appears and
the files are copied to the Windows NT computer.

There is a misconception of directories with read-only attributes. It is not the
same as acquiring read-only permissions (assigned ACL). You may open and write
to files on the directory with read-only attributes, but you may not remove or
rename the directory.
