=======

This article points out the importance of Windows NT version 3.51 Service Pack 2

MORE INFORMATION
================

The addition of Service Pack 2 (or greater) to Servers running Windows NT
version 3.51 with Service Pack 1 dramatically improves SQL Server performance in
several documented cases. Service Pack 2 contains a change to the Windows NT
Kernel (for both single and multiprocessor computers) that resolves a temporary
freeze condition that could have significant impact on SQL Server performance.
Due to the resolution of this problem, it is very important that SP2 or higher
be installed on computers running SQL Server.
