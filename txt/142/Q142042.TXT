SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the TCP/IP node-type settings in Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

The four TCP/IP node types are defined by number in Windows:

   1 - bnode (broadcast only)
   2 - pnode (WINS only)
   4 - mnode (broadcast, then WINS)
   8 - hnode (WINS, then broadcast)

The default Windows TCP/IP node types are:

   If DHCP=False, and WINS is disabled, then NodeType=1 (bnode)
   If DHCP=False, and WINS is manually set, then NodeType=8 (hnode)
   If DHCP=True, and DHCP sets WINS, then NodeType=8 (hnode)
   If DHCP=True, and WINS is manually set, then NodeType=8 (hnode)
   If DHCP=True, and WINS is disabled, then NodeType=1 (bnode)

NOTE: If WINS server options are provided via DHCP then Node Type should be set
using DHCP option 46; however, locally defining a WINS server on the client will
override these two options, as locally defined WINS servers automatically set
your node type to H-Node.

The node type can be manually changed by editing the Windows registry. The
location is under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under the following subkey:

   SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\SERVICES\VXD\MSTCP\NodeType

The four values listed above (1, 2, 4, 8) are valid values for NodeType.

NOTE: NodeType can be added as a String value under MSTCP if it does not already
exist.

For more information, please see the Windows 95 or the Windows 98 Resource Kit.
