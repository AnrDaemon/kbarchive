PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After a user-mode application attempts to open certain internal Windows NT File
System (NTFS) meta-files, Windows NT may halt with the kernel mode trap screen
STOP 0x00000024 in Ntfs.sys or STOP 0x0000001e in Ntoskrnl. The internal system
files in question are not visible to applications and the errors described above
would not be expected to occur for the reason stated here under normal usage.
Only if an application knows the names and locations of the files and there is a
deliberate attempt to access them will the system halt.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack
and in the latest Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
