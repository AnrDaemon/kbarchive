SUMMARY
=======

The steps on pages 26 and 27 of "Microsoft Visual FoxPro 3.0 for Windows Step by
Step" published by Microsoft Press do not match the book. Furthermore, clicking
the Save Order button as instructed on page 27 will cause the following error
when you try to exit from Visual FoxPro:

   Table buffer for alias "orders" contains uncommitted changes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Press is developing a corrected set of practice files for Lesson 3 and
a small portion of Lesson 9, and will post new information in this article when
the files become available.


Comments
--------

Once the Save Order button is clicked, you can properly exit Visual FoxPro by
following these steps:

1. Return to the Order Form if you are not already there. Follow the steps on
   pages 24 - 26 if necessary.

2. Press CTRL+F2 to open the Command window. Then type:

   " =TABLEREVERT (.T.) " (without the quotation marks)

If Step 2 produces an error, cancel and then reopen the Order Form and repeat
step 2. You should now be able to close Microsoft Visual FoxPro. If the
following error appears, return to the Command window and type ROLLBACK:

   " Data session #1 cannot be released with open transaction(s). " (without the
   quotation marks)

Additional error messages might be encountered. Ignore these messages and close
Visual FoxPro. These error messages include:

   Variable ORDERNUM not found.
   Function requires row or table buffering mode.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future

IMPORTANT!
Do not perform the steps in Lesson 3. Corrected files for Lesson 3 are available
at http://www.microsoft.com/support/ (on the World Wide Web) in the Free
Software section.

Microsoft Visual FoxPro 3 not to close properly. Please read Lesson 3, but do
not open the Proj_03 project.

Lesson 3 is a preview of what you will learn in Part 2, so these practice files
are not essential for working through the other lessons.
