TITLE   :XCLN: Alert Window Does Not Close After Reading Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can create rules to notify you when specific messages arrive. The Notify
With The Text option will display an alert message in the New Items Of Interest
window. After you read the message, the window does not close.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design. The New Items of Interest window is a modeless list
box that may contain multiple messages that meet the specific conditions of the
rule. Therefore, it is not automatically closed after you read the last message
in the New Items of Interest box.
