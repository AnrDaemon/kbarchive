SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to merge the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory
Services policy file (Maple.adm) with the Admin.adm policy file included with
Windows 95 to create a policy file that incorporates all policies from both
files.

For information about how to obtain the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory
Services, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS) includes a file
named Maple.adm that contains MSNDS-specific policies. This file is used with
System Policy Editor as a template to create policy files.

You can change the template in System Policy Editor by clicking Template on the
Options menu, and then selecting the Maple.adm file.

Windows 95 includes a file named Admin.adm that is used for most policies. It is
located in the Windows\Inf folder.

To create a policy file that incorporates both templates, follow these steps:

1. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the Admin.adm file in the
   Windows\Inf folder.

2. Run a second instance of the text editor and open the Maple.adm file in the
   folder containing MSNDS.

3. Copy the text in the Maple.adm file beginning with

   CATEGORY !!NWClient4

   and ending with:

   END CATEGORY; Microsoft NetWare-Compatible Network

   Paste the text into the Admin.adm file before the following section:

   CATEGORY !!AccessControl

   NOTE: When you copy the text in the Maple.adm file, make sure to include the
   CATEGORY and END CATEGORY lines in the text you are copying.

4. Copy the text in the Maple.adm file in the [Strings] section. Paste the text
   into the bottom of the [Strings] section in the Admin.adm file.

5. Save the Admin.adm file as a file named Merged.adm.

6. In System Policy Editor, click Template on the Options menu, and select the
   Merged.adm file. Note that you must close any open policy file before
   changing the template.

NOTE: System Policy Editor is not included in the floppy disk version of Windows
95. You can download Policy.exe, a self-extracting executable file containing
Poledit.exe, from online services. Please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base for information about downloading Policy.exe:
