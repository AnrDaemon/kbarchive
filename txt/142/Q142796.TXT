TITLE   :FIX: Program Generated by GENDBC Cannot be Run in Executable
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a program that was generated by the GENDBC utility is included in a
distributed executable, a "Feature is not available" error message will occur
when the program is run.

CAUSE
=====

The GENDBC generated program attempts to use the APPEND PROCEDURES and COMPILE
DATABSE commands. These commands are not supported in a distributed executable
as the compiler is not available in the run-time version of Visual FoxPro.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual
FoxPro 3.0b for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Run GENDBC on the TASTRADE database.

2. Create a new project.

3. Add the GENDBC-generated program to the project.

4. Build the project into an executable.

5. Exit Visual FoxPro, and run the executable. The "Feature is not available"
   error will occur.
