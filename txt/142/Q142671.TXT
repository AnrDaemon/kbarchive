TITLE   :Backup Fails on Certain Directories Due to Lack of Permissions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you log on with an account that has Backup Operator permissions, when you
run a backup across the network from a Windows NT 4.0 computer you may receive
the following error in the backup.log file stating you do not have permissions
to back up some directories:

   You do not have permission to access portions of data. Please see the owner
   or administrator to get permission. Directory F:\data


CAUSE
=====

An account with Backup Operator permission should have the built-in ability to
back up files that it does not have permissions to access. However, this ability
does not work properly in Windows NT 4.0.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated RDR.SYS to open remote files in the correct context.

This update is available from Microsoft support channels or directly from the
following Internet location:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa
   /nt40/hotfixes-postSP1/NTBackup-fix

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

The built-in ability of the backup operator works properly locally.
