TITLE   :OS/2 Application Does Not Return DosReadQueue Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A program that ran under OS/2 version 1.3 stops responding and has to be stopped
by pressing CTRL+C. At that point, Os2srv.exe may trap with a Dr. Watson error
message that contains:

   OS2SRV.EXE

   Access violation (0xc0000005), Address 0x01dec73c

CAUSE
=====

Under OS/2 version 1.3, a parent program starts a child session by calling
DosStartSession and providing a Queue name in the startdata.TERMQ element. The
parent program then waits on the child session by a call to DosReadQueue(Queue
name). When the child session terminates, the system sends a message to this
queue that makes the call to DosReadQueue return, with the session number of the
child session that terminated. Under OS2SS, the end of a session is not signaled
in the queue, or DosReadQueue does not return when this is signaled in the
queue.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
