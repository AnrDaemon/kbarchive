TITLE   :PRB: OLE Controls May Be Hidden by Group Box in Dialog
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler

KEYWORDS:kbGenInfo kbVC kbprb kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

OLE controls may be covered by a group box if the group box precedes the OLE
control in the tab order. In the case of an OLE Control that subclasses an edit
control -- 3D look enabled only -- the control's border will be drawn but the
control itself will not be visible, and the control will appear to be disabled.

CAUSE
=====

The tab order in a dialog is synonymous with the Z order, meaning that a control
that is first in the tab order will have a higher Z order than a control that
follows it in the Z order. A control with the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS window style set
that is overlapped by another control will not be painted in the area that is
overlapped. OLE controls have the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS window style set by default.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the tab order position of the group box to be later in the tab order than
the controls it contains. This can be done without affecting the physical tab
order of the dialog.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Standard window's controls typically do not have the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS window
style set. However, any control that does have the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS window style
set will behave as described here. In the case of OLE controls, WS_CLIPSIBLINGS
is set by default. This being the case, this behavior will be noticed any time
an OLE control is placed in a group box and the group box precedes the control
in the tab order.
