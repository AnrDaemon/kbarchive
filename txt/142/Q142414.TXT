SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to view the details of an address chosen from the Global Address
List (GAL), and you are connected to the postoffice (PO) database over a local
area network (LAN), you may get the following error message:

   Address is no longer valid. User or PO no longer exists.

CAUSE
=====

Only external postoffice addresses in the GAL containing extended ASCII
characters in their friendly name will exhibit the above symptom.

Notes:

 - You will be able to view details of this friendly name in the individual PO
   list.

 - You can view details of local PO members containing extended ASCII characters
   in their friendly names from the GAL without getting the above error.
