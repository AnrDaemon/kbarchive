SUMMARY
=======

The files listed below are those need to install Remote Access Service (RAS) in
Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51. This list may be useful if you are having difficulty
installing RAS on a computer that no longer has access to the media from which
Windows NT was originally installed. For example, if you installed Windows NT on
a laptop computer from a shared compact disc on the network, Windows NT will not
allow you to install RAS from floppies. In this example, you can simply copy all
the files listed below from the Windows NT installation compact disc to your
laptop's hard drive in a subdirectory and set up RAS from there.

the RAS client:
