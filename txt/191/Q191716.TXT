TITLE   :BUG: Assigning Resultset to RDC Does Not Update Control(s)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Opening a resultset in code and then assigning it to the Resultset property of
the MSRDC (which is bound to a text box), will not populate the text box.

RESOLUTION
==========

A workaround is to simply add another line of code immediately following "Set
MSRDC1.ResultSet = rs" that specifically references the field desired for the
text box. For example, Text1.DataField = "au_lname" would populate the first
record into the text box as well as physically bind the RecordSet to the MSRDC.
At this point, the MSRDC will have the full capability of scrolling through
records.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Standard EXE Project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Go to Project/Components, and select the "Microsoft Remote Data Control 2.0."

3. Go to Project/References, and select the "Microsoft Remote Data Object 2.0."

4. Drop the MSRDC on the form as well as a TextBox and CommandButton.

5. Set the following properties on the Text box:

   DataSource: MSRDC1
   DataField: au_lname

6. Paste the following code inside the Command_Click() Event:

         Dim cn As New rdoConnection
         Dim rs As rdoResultset
         cn.CursorDriver = rdUseOdbc
         cn.Connect = "dsn=pubs2;database=pubs;uid=sa;pwd="
         cn.EstablishConnection rdDriverNoPrompt, False
         Set rs = cn.OpenResultset("Select * from authors", rdOpenDynamic,
         rdConcurValues, rdExecDirect)
         Set MSRDC1.Resultset = rs
         'Text1.DataField = "au_lname"  'need this line of code to actually
                                        'populate the text box.

7. Run the application.
