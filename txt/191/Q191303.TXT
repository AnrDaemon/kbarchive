TITLE   :SMS: Ipconfig.exe Makes Inventory Stop on Windows for Workgroups
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Ipconfig.exe causes inventory to stop responding on Windows for Workgroups 3.11
client computers running VLM without the TCP/IP protocol.

When running Runsms.bat in verbose mode, the following error message is
displayed:

   Windows IP configuration version 1.0. Error: Winsock failed to initialize.

Inventory stops responding at 43 percent and the computer must be restarted.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, disable TCP/IP inventory collection by creating an
Smssafe.tmp file in the Ms\Sms\Data subdirectory. This file should contain the
following line:

       WolverineInfo=CRASHED
