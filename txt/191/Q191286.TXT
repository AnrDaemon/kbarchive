TITLE   :XFOR: Notes Connector Crashes When Importing Too-Long Field
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Administrators of Microsoft Exchange may encounter an access violation against
Lsdxants.exe when running the "full upload" directory synchronization option
between Exchange and Lotus Notes.

CAUSE
=====

One field in the imported document is larger than the 512-byte size of the
buffer used to read the data. The buffer then overwrites the stack, and the
access violation occurs when trying to return from this function.

WORKAROUND
==========

The stack in the Dr. Watson log contains the faulty field. Reducing the field
size to less than 512 bytes resolves the issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
