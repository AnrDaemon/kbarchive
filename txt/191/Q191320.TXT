STATUS

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix do the following:

1. On the Systems Management Server site server, replace the Getmem.exe file in
   the <SMS_root>\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin directory with
   the version obtained from the hotfix.

   This step can be performed automatically by running Hotfix.exe with the
   provided Hotfix.ini file.

   The files will be replicated at the next Maintenance Manager work cycle to all
   Systems Management Server logon servers to the SMS\Logon.srv\X86.bin
   directory. When that occurs, the clients can be updated.

2. To update the clients, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each client or
   follow the instructions in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
