TITLE   :BUG: Scrollbar Disabled in IDE When Enabled is Set to False
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When designing a form, if you add a horizontal or vertical ScrollBar and set one
or both to disabled, then you cannot use click-and-drag to move the ScrollBar(s)
unless you close and re-open the form.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, set the Enabled property of the ScrollBars in the Form
Load event. See step 5 in the MORE INFORMATION section below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a vertical ScrollBar control and a horizontal ScrollBar control to to
   Form1.

3. Set the Enabled property of each ScrollBar to False. Note that you can not
   change the positions of the ScrollBars by clicking and dragging the control
   with the mouse.

4. Close the form and re-open it. The ScrollBars can now be re-positioned.

5. Set the Enabled property of the horizontal and vertical ScrollBars to True,
   and then add the following code to the Form Load event:

         HScroll1.Enabled = False
         VScroll1.Enabled = False

   You can now reposition the ScrollBars as expected.
