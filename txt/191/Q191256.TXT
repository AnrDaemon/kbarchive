TITLE   :Time-taken Log Field Incorrect When KeepAlive Is Enabled
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Information Server (IIS) log-file format contains a parameter for
processing time. This field is the total amount of processing time that is spent
on the server for a particular DLL. This internal timer starts on Packet 1 and
ends on the last Acknowledgement received from the client indicating that that
the processing has been completed on the server. However, the logged time is not
correct if KeepAlive is enabled for the connection between the IIS computer and
the Internet browser.

CAUSE
=====

The counter that measures time is not reset for KeepAlive connections.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
