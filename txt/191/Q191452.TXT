KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, version 1.0, included with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

HRESULT 80004005, (Key not found.) is returned to a consumer program attempting
to open a VSAM KSDS on an OS/390 mainframe.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem, be sure to define the entire VSAM record key in the
Host Column Definition file (HCD). Naturally, this means that all the VSAM
record fields that precede the key in the VSAM file record layout must also be
defined in the HCD file.
