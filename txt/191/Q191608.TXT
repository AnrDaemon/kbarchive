TITLE   :XFOR: Failure Creating Windows NT Accounts Using Linkage 3.2
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - LinkAge Message Exchange, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to create a Windows NT user account after configuring Linkage
Message Exchange 3.2 LDE between Lotus Notes and Exchange Server (and enabling
Windows NT account creation or deletion), the attempt will produce a failure
(viewable in Linkage Admin) similar to the following :

   1998/05/29 11:39:27- DXAMEX(019b) 2 67206:MS Exchange Reports: Unable to
   create Windows NT account TESTDOMAIN\\TESTUSER for mailbox Test User
   because it contains the illegal character(s) \.

CAUSE
=====

Linkage Message Exchange 3.2 uses the Exchange Server Directory Application
Program Interface (DAPI) to communicate with the Microsoft Exchange Server
Directory service. The Windows NT account name was being passed from Linkage
Message Exchange 3.2 to DAPI in an "Assoc-NT-Account" attribute with a value of
TESTDOMAIN\\TESTUSER. Normally, if an attribute has a backslash, then it is
appropriate to escape the backslash (add another backslash); however, DAPI does
not expect this processing for the "Assoc-NT- Account."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Linkage Message Exchange version
3.2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
