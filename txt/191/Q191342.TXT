======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2 SP2, 1.2 SP3, 1.2 SP4, 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After applying Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 2 or later, the
updated Appsta16.exe file fails to run the configuration command line for shared
applications that have the option "Runs with UNC Name" selected.

This version of Appstart.exe is only used on client computers running Windows 3.1
or Windows for Workgroups 3.11. They normally receive the following error:

   Cannot configure <app name>. Cannot obtain the configuration program
   name.

It is also possible for different errors to occur as well.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do either of the following:

 - Configure the shared application to run with a drive letter and not a UNC
   connection.

-or-

 - Copy all of the files used by the configuration command line to the
   SMS\Site.srv\Maincfg.Box\MStest directory. This may not always be a very
   desirable solution if the configuration requires a large number of files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
