OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2

SYMPTOMS
========

All packages that have been installed using Systems Management Server Package
Command Manager (PCM) should be moved to the Executed Commands folder. The
installed packages are removed from the Package Command Manager window when the
client's system time exceeds the package's expiration dates.

PCM fails to move Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 5 packages to the Executed
Commands folder. The upgrade process completes successfully on the client, but
the package remains under Pending Commands.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
