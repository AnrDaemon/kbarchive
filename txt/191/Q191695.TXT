======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.5, 2.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating a remote view to a FoxPro table using the Visual FoxPro ODBC
driver, the following error occurs when you set a Left Outer Join in the Join
tab between two tables:

   Connectivity error: [Microsoft][ODBC Visual FoxPro Driver]Command Contains
   unrecognized phrase/keyword.

RESOLUTION
==========

Access the FoxPro tables directly, using the SQL - SELECT command. For example:

      CREATE SQL VIEW test CONNECTION myconn;
      AS SELECT * FROM orders LEFT OUTER JOIN orditems;
      ON orders.order_id = orditems.order_id

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a datasource to the Visual FoxPro ODBC driver in the ODBC
   Administrator pointing to the Testdata.dbc sample database.

2. Open any .dbc in Visual FoxPro and create a remote view using the datasource
   created in step 1.

3. Add the Orders.dbf and Orditems.dbf using the join condition of the field
   order_id.

4. Close the Open dialog box and select the Add All button in the Fields tab of
   the View Designer.

5. Select the Join tab and in the Type drop-down list box, select Left Outer
   Join. In the Field Name drop-down list box, select Orders.order_id. In the
   Value drop-down list box, select Orditems.order_id.

6. Run the view and note that the error occurs.
