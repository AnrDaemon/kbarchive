 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0, on platform(s):

SYMPTOMS
========

Creating an EXE in Visual Basic on Windows 98 creates a file without a .EXE
extension. Attempting to run the application by clicking on the filename within
Windows Explorer opens a dialog asking you to "Open With...", providing a list
of installed applications.

CAUSE
=====

The .EXE file created does not have a .EXE extension, therefore Windows does not
know how to open the file. The file extension will not be created if the
following conditions are true:

 - The Windows Explorer setting "Hide File extensions for known file types" is
   set to the default value of True.

 - The Windows Explorer setting for Hidden Files is set to the default option of
   "Do not show hidden system files."

 - The above two settings have never been changed from their default values.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, change the Windows Explorer setting for "Hide File
extensions for known file types" and change the Hidden Files option to something
other than "Do Not show hidden or system files."

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Open Windows Explorer. Choose Folder Options from the View menu.

2. Select the View Tab. Deselect the "Hide Files extensions for known file
   types."

3. Change the Hidden Files option to something other than "Do not show hidden or
   system files."

   If you change the above two settings on Windows 98 from their defaults and
   then set them back again, this problem will no longer occur.

STATUS
======
