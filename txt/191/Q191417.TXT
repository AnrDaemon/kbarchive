TITLE   :SMS: Dataloader Service Delete Group Action May Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDataLoader smsdataloader

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The System Management Server Dataloader service may fail to perform a Delete
Group on the attribute intended for history from the current inventory record.
When an inventory attribute changes on a client, the old one must be deleted and
the new one added. The problem occurs, however, when the Delete fails, which can
lead to duplication of group data.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
