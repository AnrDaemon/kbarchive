The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft HTML Help 1.3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following components are required in order to view an HTML help file (*.chm)
from the operating system level:

   HH.EXE         (Windows or WinNT directory)
   HHCTRL.OCX     (System or System32 directory)
   ITSS.DLL       (System or System32 directory)
   ITIRCL.DLL    (System or System32 directory)

NOTE: These files may not be required in order to view the Help file from within
Visual FoxPro.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing the Microsoft Developer Network and any Visual Studio Help files
automatically installs and register these files.

For developers who create HTML Help files for distribution with their
applications, the Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard handles the installation and
registration of the necessary Help engine files when you check the HTML help
engine checkbox in step 2.
