TITLE   :BUG: Deleted Event Does Not Fire When Deleting Programmatically
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A grid's Deleted event does not fire when a record is programmatically deleted.
However, the event does fire if you interactively delete a record in a grid.

RESOLUTION
==========

Call the grid's Deleted event explicitly using code. For the sample code in the
MORE INFORMATION section, see step 3 for further instructions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program (.prg) file that contains the following code and run the
   program:

         CREATE TABLE Ztest (A c(1), B c(1))
         INSERT INTO Ztest (A,B) VALUES ('A', 'B')

         USE 'Ztest'

         F1 = CREATE('oForm')
         F1.SHOW
         * F1.gridcontrol.Deleted  && Remove comment to see grid's Deleted
                                   && event fire.
         READ EVENTS

         DEFINE CLASS oForm AS FORM
            ADD OBJECT GRIDcontrol AS myGRID
            PROC INIT
               DELETE
            PROC DESTROY
               CLEAR EVENTS
         ENDDEFINE

         DEFINE CLASS myGRID AS GRID
            RECORDSOURCE='Ztest'
            RECORDSOURCETYPE=1
            PROC DELETED
               LPARAMETERS nRecNo
               WAIT WIND "Deleted Event Fired"
         ENDDEFINE

2. Notice that the record is marked as deleted in the grid, but the grid's
   Deleted event never fired. Now, double-click the deletion marker in the grid
   (the black rectangle to left of the first field in the grid) and note that
   the grid's deleted event fires as expected.

3. Remove the asterisk from the commented line of code in the example so that is
   reads as follows:

         F1.gridcontrol.Deleted

   Run the example again. Note that the grid's Deleted event fires when
   explicitly called with code.
