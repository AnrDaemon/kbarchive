======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a Windows 95-based computer using the Novell intraNetWare client to
log on to a Novell NetWare server on a Windows NT domain with an expired NetWare
password, you may not be able to synchronize all passwords when you change your
NetWare password. If you try to synchronize all passwords when you change your
password, the NetWare and Windows passwords may be changed, but not the Windows
NT domain password.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the intraNetWare logon is the primary logon for the
Windows 95 client, and the intraNetWare client attempts to change (and
synchronize) the passwords at logon.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   Q198035 User Profiles Not Copied to Server with Updated Mprserv.dll File

   Q188206 "Access Denied" Connecting to Windows NT Server with Many Shares

In addition to the files listed above, you need the following updated files from
Novell:

   Lgnw9532.dll
   Nwpasswd.dll

Refer to "95250p1.exe; Password Sync Fix for 95 Client" from Novell.


Refer to Novell Knowledge Base article 2944003, "Unable to Change Password on
Using 95/98 GUI."

Note that this resolution works only if the IntraNetWare client is set as your
primary network logon.

STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
