KEYWORDS:kbInternet kbVBp kbVBp600bug kbWebClasses kbVS600sp3fix kbWinDNA kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Internet Information Server (IIS) could have an access violation when shutting
down.

CAUSE
=====

The IIS environment at termination does not guarantee the order of DLL unloads.
As a result the Visual Basic runtime is sometimes unloaded before it can be
cleanly shut down. This results in the access violation. This can happen
sporadically but only if you have the Visual Basic project option Retain in
Memory set On. However, not setting Retain in Memory can cause more serious
issues.
