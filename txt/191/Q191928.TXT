SUMMARY
=======

As stated in the Microsoft License Agreement that ships with SNA Server, the
3270 and 5250 terminal emulation applets and the ODBC/DRDA driver provided with
SNA Server are licensed for use only by one user per licensed SNA Server.
Licenses for additional users must be acquired separately from NetManage or
StarQuest, as described below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 3270 and 5250 emulation applets are provided with SNA Server so that
customers can perform basic connectivity testing. However, the SNA Server
license agreement only allows an applet to be used on a single desktop. A single
desktop may use either applet for demonstration, testing, or production use.
