TITLE   :FIX: Connection Designer Closes if Verify Connection Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create or edit a connection in the Connection Designer and try to test
the connection with the Verify Connection button, the Connection Designer
closes.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a work around, you can save your connection within the Connection Designer
before clicking the Verify Connection button. You can accomplish this by
clicking the OK button in the Connection Designer, giving the connection a name
if you have not yet saved it, and then click the Modify button in the
Connections dialog box after selecting the connection from the list.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.prg) file:

         CLOSE DATA ALL
         SET SAFETY OFF
         CREATE DATABASE testdb
         CREATE TABLE testtab (f1 c(10), f2 N(10))
         CLOSE DATABASE ALL
         SET SAFETY ON
         OPEN DATABASE testdb EXCLUSIVE
         MODI DATABASE testdb NOWAIT
         KEYBOARD '{shift+f10}{o}{alt+n}{alt+n}'

2. In the ODBC Data Source Administrator, click the System DSN tab and then
   click the Add button.

3. From the list in the Create New Data Source dialog box, select "Microsoft
   Visual FoxPro Driver" and then click the Finish button.

4. In the ODBC Visual FoxPro Setup dialog box, enter a data source name, such as
   "Vfptest", without the quotes.

5. Enter the path to the .dbc you created in the program in Step 1. This, in
   effect, will be the default directory when the program runs, and the file
   will be called Testdb.dbc.

6. Click OK then click OK again.

7. You will now be back in the Connection Designer. Select the data source you
   just created from the Data Source drop-down.

8. Click the Verify Connection button.

The Connection Designer closes. The connection fails because Testdb.dbc was
opened exclusively by the program. If the database opens shared, the connection
succeeds.
