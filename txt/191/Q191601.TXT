TITLE   :Defragmentation Application Hangs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While running a defragmentation application on a volume that is formatted as
FAT, the application can cease to respond (hang), along with other applications,
and possibly the computer itself. No record of the hang will be logged. No entry
will appear in the event logs, and a Dr. Watson error will not occur.

CAUSE
=====

Running a defragmentation application while you actively open and close files
forces Windows NT to enter a timing window. This timing window makes unsafe
synchronization possible on the file being defragmented, and the system hangs as
it waits for the error condition to be resolved. All defragmentation
applications that use FSCTL_MOVE_FILE on FAT call are susceptible. This error is
rare in occurrence.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.
