SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the process to recover a damaged Windows NT installation
using an Emergency Repair Disk (ERD) on an Alpha-based computer.

You can create an ERD during the installation of Windows NT or by running the
Repair Disk utility (RDISK) after installation. The ERD includes the following
files:

 - System._ (system configuration)

 - Software._ (software information)

 - Default._ (default user profile)

 - Ntuser.DA_ (new user profile)

 - Security._ (security policy)

 - Sam._ (user accounts dDatabase)

 - Setup.log

 - Autoexec.nt

 - Config.nt

In the event that a Windows NT system file or the registry becomes damaged, you
may be able to use the ERD to restore the affected files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To perform the repair process, follow these steps:

1. Start your computer, and press F2 when you are prompted to enter the Alpha
   Basic Input/Output System (AlphaBIOS) Setup utility.

2. Select Install Windows NT, and then press ENTER.

3. Specify the computer type and mass storage devices. You may need to provide
   an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) disk if your device is not listed.

4. When the Welcome To Setup screen appears, press R.

5. Move the selector bar with the arrow keys to the tasks that you want Windows
   NT Setup to perform. Press ENTER to select or clear the options. To restore
   the system completely, select all options.

6. Select Continue (Perform Selected Tasks), and then press ENTER.

7. Windows NT Setup displays the detected mass storage devices. You may not need
   to specify any additional mass storage devices. However if any mass storage
   devices that are installed are not listed, press S to specify additional
   devices. You may need to provide an OEM disk if your device is not listed.
   Press ENTER to continue.

8. Press ENTER if you have the ERD, or press ESC if you do not have the ERD.

   If you press ENTER, insert the ERD into the floppy disk drive, and then press
   ENTER.

   If you press ESC, Windows NT Setup searches for a Windows NT installation.

9. Move the selector bar with the arrow keys to the registry files that you want
   Windows NT Setup to restore. Press ENTER to select or clear the options. To
   restore the system completely, select all options.

10. Select Continue (Perform Selected Tasks), and then press ENTER. Windows NT
   Setup examines files.

11. Press ENTER to restart your computer.

NOTE: These steps were tested with a Digital Personal Workstation 500a. The
initial boot process may differ slightly for other Alpha-based computers.
