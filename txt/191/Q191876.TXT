The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5, 5.01, 5.5 for Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5, 5.01, 5.5 for Windows 98 
 - The Microsoft Network versions 2.51, 2.6, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you quit all instances of Internet Explorer, you may not be prompted to
disconnect from MSN, The Microsoft Network.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you connect to the Internet using Internet Explorer
rather than by using the MSN or Quick Connect icon. When you connect with
Internet Explorer, the Dial-Up Networking connection created by MSN Setup is
used. This connection does not automatically prompt you to disconnect when you
quit Internet Explorer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, create a new connection icon for MSN using the settings
in your current MSN connection, and then configure Internet Explorer to use the
new connection:

1. Double-click My Computer, and then double-click Dial-Up Networking.

2. Right-click the MSN icon, click Properties, and write down all the
   information in the connection, and then click OK.

3. Double-click Make New Connection, type a name for the new connection, and
   then click Next.

4. Enter the local access number that you copied from the MSN phone list, click
   Next, and then click Finish.

5. Right-click the new icon, click Properties, on the Server Types tab select
   the same properties as the original dialer, and then click Ok to return to
   Dial-up Networking.

6. Click Start, click Settings, and then click Control Panel.

7. Double-click the Internet icon or the Internet Options icon and then click
   the Connections tab.

8. In the Dial-up Settings window select the new connection, select Always Dial
   My Default Connection, and then click Set Default.

9. Click Settings, under Dial-up Settings type your username as MSN/username,
   type your MSN password in the Password box, click OK, and then click OK
   again.
