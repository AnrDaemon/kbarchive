TITLE   :XCLN: Can't Send Internet/SMTP Mail with MS Mail Postoffice
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0; :8.0,8.01,8.02,8.03
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to send a message to an Internet/SMTP address, you may receive a
non-delivery report (NDR) from the System Administrator indicating that it was
unable to deliver the message. Also, if you can receive messages from
Internet/SMTP addresses, you may not be able to reply to the messages. The NDR
has the following text:

   No Gateway Installed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by the processing order of the Microsoft Mail and
Internet Mail services in your profile.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, do the following:

1. Start Outlook.

2. From the Tools menu, click Services. Note that this menu item will not be
   available if you are in a message.

3. Select the Delivery tab.

4. Change the order of the information services. Typically, the Microsoft Mail
   Transport is listed first, followed by the Internet Mail Transport. Change
   the order, so that the Internet Mail Transport is listed first.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setting the processing order of services is necessary only if you have more than
one information service that supports the same address type. For example, you
may have Microsoft Exchange Server and then Internet Mail, in that order. Any
message you send to an Internet recipient is processed and sent via Microsoft
Exchange Server, because this service also supports Internet addresses. If you
want all messages addressed to Internet recipients to be processed by the
Internet Mail Service, move this service to the top of the list.
