SUMMARY
=======

Administrators of Microsoft Exchange managing multiple versions of the Internet
Mail Connector may notice that in older versions, address nomenclature not
normally seen in Internet Mail messages are accepted inbound, but not accepted
inbound with later versions. The 553 malformed address: return code will be
seen.

As the Microsoft Exchange product matures, the Internet Mail Connector by design
is more strict with respect to address formatting.

   of Windows NT).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

   System/CurrentControlSet/Services/MSExchangeIMC/Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then use the following entry:
