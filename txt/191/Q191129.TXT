======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Multiple Help menus appear when an MFC server is activated within an Active
document server that supports in-place editing (such as Microsoft Word), and
that document is opened by an Active document container (such as Internet
Explorer 4.0). In debug builds, an ASSERT occurs in Oledocip.cpp line 151.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs with any in-place activation server created with MFC, where
the server is not an Active document server.

RESOLUTION
==========

One workaround is to enable your server as an Active document. See the Visual
C++ Help topic "Upgrade to an Active Document Server" for details on adding this
support to an existing Active document server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Build Scribble Step7, and run it to register it on the system.

2. Start Microsoft Word and insert a Scribb document.

3. Save the Word document, and open it in Internet Explorer.

4. Double-click on the Scribb Object to activate it.

RESULTS:

   ASSERT in olefrm.cpp line 637.

   There are also two Help menus in the Internet Explorer menu bar.
