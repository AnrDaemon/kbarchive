Filer cannot search for and find a file if the file is in a directory where the
directory has read only or the hidden attribute.

RESOLUTION

Make sure that the read only or hidden attribute is removed from the directory.

MORE INFORMATION

Filer is an ActiveX control component that provides a file and text search
engine. After the Filer.dll file is downloaded and is used to search for a file,
sometimes the search fails.

1. Download the Filer.zip file from the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/vfoxpro/techmat/whitepapers/filer.htm

   files:

   Msvcrt.dll
   Filer.scx

3. Register the Filer.dll file using the following syntax:

         REGSVR32 C:\VFP\Filer.dll

4. Open Explorer and right-click the Visual FoxPro directory. In the Visual
   FoxPro properties dialog box, select the Properties tab and change the
   directory attribute to READ-ONLY.

5. Run the Filer.scx form.

6. In the File Finder dialog box, type the following information in the
