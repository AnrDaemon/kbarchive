TITLE   :PRB: Enumerated Data Types in DBGRID32.OCX
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Microsoft Data Bound Grid Control (DBGRID32.OCX) in Visual Basic,
one of two symptoms can occur:

1. The autolist may not drop down enumerated types for some declared
   properties.

   -or-

2. In the Object Browser, some enumerated types cannot be viewed because they
   are hidden.

CAUSE
=====

The enum data types for the Data Bound Grid Control are defined in the Type
Library. The constants defined in the those enum data types are hidden;
therefore, you cannot view the contents of the enum datatypes.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are declaring a variable as:

      Dim x As enumSplitSizeModeConstants

then this should be modified to read:

      Dim x As SplitSizeModeConstants

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although the Microsoft Data Bound Grid Control (DBGRID32.OCX) ships with Visual
Basic 6.0, a new control called the Microsoft DataGrid Control 6.0
(MSDATGRD.OCX) is also included with Visual Basic 6.0. This new control does not
exhibit the above-mentioned behavior.

Steps to Reproduce the Autolist Drop Down Behavior
--------------------------------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic and open a Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Under the Project menu, select Components. A dialog will be shown that lists
   all the available controls. In the Controls tab, check the "Microsoft Data
   Bound Grid Control" (DBGRID32.OCX), then click OK. The control will be added
   to the Visual Basic components toolbar.

3. Add a DBGrid control to Form1.

4. In any event procedure, type the following code:

         Dim x As enumSplitSizeModeConstants

5. When you type "x =" you will notice that the autolist box does not appear as
   expected.

6. Now, change the DIM statement above to:

         Dim x As SplitSizeModeConstants
    

7. Notice that when you type "x =" you get a list of enumerated types.

Steps to Reproduce the Hidden Type in Object Browser Behavior
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic and open a Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add the "Microsoft Data Bound Grid Control" (DBGRID32.OCX) to the Visual
   Basic components toolbar.

3. From the View Menu, select Object Browser or Press the F2 key.

4. Select MSDBGrid from the Project/Library drop-down list box.

5. Under the Classes list box, select Split.

6. Under the Members of "Split" list box, select SizeMode.

7. You will see in the bottom frame that SizeMode is declared as
   enumSplitSizeModeConstants.

8. Click on enumSplitSizeModeConstants. Visual Basic will display the message,
   "Cannot jump to 'enumSplitSizeModeConstants' because it is hidden."
