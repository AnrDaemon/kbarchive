SUMMARY
=======

This article shows you the type declaration characters and corresponding data
types. A Type Declaration Character is a character appended to a variable name
indicating the variable's data type. For example, the variable name MyString$
has a dollar sign appended to the variable name and is dimensioned as a String
data type.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following table shows the type declaration characters and corresponding data
types.

Type Declaration Character  Data Type
--------------------------  ---------
<BLOCKQUOTE>
          %                 Integer
          &                 Long
          !                 Single
          #                 Double
          $                 String
          @                 Currency

Even when using type declaration characters, you still need to declare your
variables when you have Option Explicit at the beginning of the Module. Using
Option Explicit is recommended to prevent problems due to misspelled variable
names. When "Require Variable Declaration" is checked in the Editor Tab of the
Options dialog box from the Tools Menu, Option Explicit is added to new Modules
automatically. If you use Option Explicit, but you do not declare your
variables, you will receive the following error message at run-time:

   Compile Error
   Variable Not Defined

To prevent this error from occurring, you can either remove Option Explicit or
explicitly declare your variables. Using type declaration characters allows you
to shorten these statements. For example, you can use this:

      Dim MyVar$

instead of this:

      Dim MyVar As String

Both statements declare MyVar to be a memory variable of type String.
