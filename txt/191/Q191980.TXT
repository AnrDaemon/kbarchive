TITLE   :PRB: Application Builder Not Removing Form/Report from Project
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Application builder to Add a form or a report to a project,
removing the form or report from within the Application builder will not remove
the form or report from the project.

CAUSE
=====

This is done intentionally since removing the form from the project may break
the application.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Launch the Application Wizard by selecting the Wizards menu option from the
   Tools menu.

2. Type the name for the project in the Application Wizard and click OK.

   NOTE: You see a wait window that displays the following message:

   Please be patient while application is being generated...

3. After the Project Manager opens and the Microsoft Developer Network help
   activates, the "Developing Application using the Application Framework and
   Application Builder" topic appears. Close the help file and select the
   Application Builder window.

4. Click the Data tab in the Application Builder and select the Table Wizard
   button to create a table, such as the Accounts table.

5. After creating the table, place the table in the datasource grid of the data
   tab. Make sure the Form and Report check boxes are selected.

6. Select the Generate button to create a form and a report based on the table
   in the datasource.

7. Once the process is completed, the form and report are added to the project
   manager.

8. Select the Forms or the Reports tab in the Application Builder.

9. Select the form or report that just created and click the Remove button to
   remove the form or report out from Application Builder.

The form or report in the Application builder gets deleted; however, the form or
report still stays in the Project Manager.
