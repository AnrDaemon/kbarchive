======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) to create a setup package
for a Visual Basic project that contains the Microsoft Internet Controls, PDW
does not include the Shdocvw.dll file in your setup package.

CAUSE
=====

Shdocvw.dll is a core component of Microsoft Internet Explorer. Under current
redistribution policy, you are not allowed to redistribute Internet Explorer in
your application. Therefore, Shdocvw.dll is not included in your setup package.


RESOLUTION
==========

To enable the functionality of the Microsoft Internet Controls, users of your
application are required to have Internet Explorer installed on their computers.
