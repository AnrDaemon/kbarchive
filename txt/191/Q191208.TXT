SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT Server 4.0 Concepts and Planning documentation details how
assigning the Manage Documents security permission to a user for an individual
printer allows that user to manage all print jobs aimed at that printer,
regardless of who actually owns or created the particular print job.

This is incorrect. Manage Documents only allows the user who submitted the print
job to change of the status of that print job. Users who only have the Manage
Documents security permission will receive an "Access Denied" error message if
they attempt to change the status of a print job that they do not own.

A user must have the Full Control permission on the printer to allow management
of all print jobs aimed at that printer, regardless of owner/creator.
