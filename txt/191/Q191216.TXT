SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for the CallByName function states that the first parameter is
the "name of the object on which the function will be executed." This may be
misleading when you use it with properties and methods of a Class. If you use
CallByName with the properties and methods of a Class, the first parameter is
actually an object variable reference and not the name of the Class. The object
must be instantiated prior to using CallByName.
