TITLE   :PRB: Do Not Modify ASP File That Is Created by WebClass Designer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInternet kbVBp kbVBp600 kbWebClasses kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Place a Response.write command just before the ProcessNoStateWebClass call in
the .asp file generated by the WebClass Designer. When you navigate to that
site, you see only the Response.write output. You do not see any output from
your WebClass even though the code is running.

CAUSE
=====

The information that the WebClass writes to the Response property is flushed by
the call to Response.write in the .asp file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not change the .asp file that is created by the WebClass designer.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following is a sample .asp file created by the WebClass Designer that has been
modified. Notice the Response.write "Initializing " line of code.

Sample Code
-----------

      <%
      Response.Buffer=True
      Response.Expires=0

      If (VarType(Application("~WC~WebClassManager")) = 0) Then
       Application.Lock
       If (VarType(Application("~WC~WebClassManager")) = 0) Then
        Set Application("~WC~WebClassManager") =
        Server.CreateObject("WebClassRuntime.WebClassManager")
       End If
       Application.UnLock
      End if

      Response.write "Initializing "

      Application("~WC~WebClassManager").ProcessNoStateWebClass "MyApp.xxx", _
        Server, _
        Application, _
        Session, _
        Request, _
        Response
      %>

When you navigate to this site, you see only the Response.write output. You do
not see any output from your WebClass even though the code is running.
