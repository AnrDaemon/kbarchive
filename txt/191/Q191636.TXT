Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.prg) file:

         #DEFINE    ARRAYSIZE       14
         DIMENSION oRef[ARRAYSIZE]
         FOR lni = 1 TO ARRAYSIZE
            oRef[lni] = CREATEOBJECT("Toolbar")
            oRef[lni].SHOW
            oRef[lni].DOCK(1)
            WAIT WINDOW "Creating "+ STR(lni) NOWA
         ENDFOR
         WAIT CLEAR
         FOR lni = 1 TO ARRAYSIZE
            WAIT WINDOW "Releasing "+ STR(lni) NOWA
            oRef[lni] = .NULL. && Use this in VFP 5, 3.0b
         ENDFOR
         WAIT CLEAR

2. Under Windows NT, you see an error like the following:

   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x77f7d514

   Under Windows 95, you will see an error like the following:

NOTE: It may take multiple runs of the preceding program before you see the error
occur in Windows 95.
