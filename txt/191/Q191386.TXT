TITLE   :Considerations When Installing Link Services in SNA 4.0

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

In a computing environment where disk space utilization, connection speeds, and
overall efficiency of operations are considerations, it may be helpful to
consider what link services will be used. Only those link services that will be
used on the SNA Server computer should be installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During the installation of SNA Server 4.0, the opportunity to install one or
more link services is presented to the SNA Server administrator. Considerations
of what link service or services will be used on the SNA Server computer can
have an impact on server storage, and on the installation process itself.

Installing all of the link services will use approximately 41 MB of disk space.
The sizes of the individual link services range from 800 KB to 7 MB depending on
the choices for the computing environment. If the installation is on a computer
that has constrained storage resources, space can be saved by installing only
the link services that will be used on that computer. For example, if the 802.2
link service and a second link service will be the only two link services used
by the SNA Server computer, a very large percent of the storage space that would
be used to keep copies of unused link services can be returned to the server
storage subsystem.

In addition, if the installation is to be performed across a slow link, or even
across a LAN link, time and bandwidth can be saved by installing only the link
services that will be used by the SNA Server computer.
