PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Details window of a Run Command On Workstation job contains an option for
"Not Mandatory Over Slow Link" to prevent mandatory installation of a package
over a slow link. However, the functionality was not implemented in Systems
Management 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2, so consequently the option has no effect on package
execution.

The option "Not Mandatory Over Slow Link" has been removed from Systems
Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
