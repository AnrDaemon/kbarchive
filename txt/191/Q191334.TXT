SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a computer running Windows NT Server 3.51 that is configured as a
logon server in Systems Management Server 1.2 and the computer is restarted, the
Service Control Manager may report that a service failed to start. Examination
of the system event log on the computer reveals that the Remote Control Agent
stopped responding during startup. This problem may occur every time the
computer is restarted.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
