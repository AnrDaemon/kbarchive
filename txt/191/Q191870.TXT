The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, version 1.0, included with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a consumer or client program, using ADO, asks for multiple records from an
IBM OS/390 VSAM file, the response time is very slow and increases with the
number of records retrieved.

To improve the response time, set the CacheSize property of the ADO recordset to
a reasonable value greater than one (1), which is the default.

The CacheSize property is described in the ADO online documentation, which Can be
installed with the Microsoft Data Access Components.
