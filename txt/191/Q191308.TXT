SYMPTOMS
========

An access violation may occur when you attempt to convert a W3C extended log
file to any other log file format.

CAUSE
=====

Convlog is reading less than the full log line for parsing, so the remaining
part of the line is being treating as a separate log entry.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION

log line.
