SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to gain access to a network resource on your Novell NetWare network
that requires a password that your login script already provided, you may still
be prompted for your password. Note that this behavior may occur even if you
enter the password information and then click the Save This Password check box
to select it.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because passwords for attached NetWare resources are not
cached unless they are the same as the password for the preferred server.
