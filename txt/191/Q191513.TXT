======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.0, 2.1 SP2, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If multiple stored procedures are executed when using ADO 2.0, the T-SQL
Debugger automatically starts for the first stored procedure, but does not
automatically start upon executing the second or subsequent stored procedures.
The following error message displays:

   The query could not be debugged due to a problem coordinating events with the
   server. Check the server and client log to find the exact cause, fix the
   problem and try again.

This problem no longer occurs in ADO 2.1 and later when calling simple stored
procedures like the pubs..reptq1 procedure that is called in the example code
below. However, if you are calling multiple stored procedures that accept
parameters, using a single ADO Connection, the T-SQL Debugger does not start
automatically when executing the second or subsequent stored procedures. You
will either receive the error described above, or it will fail silently.

RESOLUTION
==========

In ADO 2.1 and later, to temporarily work around this while debugging, execute
each store procedure on a separate connection. This workaround is illustrated in
"Steps to Reproduce Behavior Using ADO 2.1" that follows.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior Using ADO 2.0
-----------------------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project.

2. Add a reference to the Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.0 Library.

3. From the Add-Ins menu, click Add_In Manager and then select the Visual Basic
   TSQL Debugger Loaded/Unloaded check box.

4. Paste the following code into the Form_Load section of the form. Change the
   Data Source, Initial Catalog, User ID and Password in the connection string
   to match your configuration:

         Dim cn As New ADODB.Connection
         Dim cmd As New ADODB.Command
         Dim cmd2 As New ADODB.Command
         cn.Open "Provider=SQLOLEDB;Data Source=<Your Server>;" & _
                 "Initial Catalog=pubs;User ID=sa;pwd=;"
         cmd.ActiveConnection = cn
         cmd.CommandText = "reptq1"
         cmd.CommandType = adCmdStoredProc
         cmd.Execute  'TSQL Debugger is invoked at this point.

         MsgBox "Error Will Occur Next"

         cmd2.ActiveConnection = cn
         cmd2.CommandText = "reptq1"
         cmd2.CommandType = adCmdStoredProc
         cmd2.Execute  'TSQL Debugger is not invoked at this point.

5. The error occurs as soon as the Form_Load finishes running.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior Using ADO 2.1 or Later
--------------------------------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project.

2. Add a reference to the Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects Library.

3. From the Add-Ins menu, click Add_In Manager and then select the Visual Basic
   TSQL Debugger Loaded/Unloaded check box.

4. Paste the following code into the Form_Load section of the form. Change the
   Data Source, Initial Catalog, User ID and Password in both connection strings
   to match your configuration:

   Dim cn As New ADODB.Connection
   Dim cn2 As New ADODB.Connection
   Dim strSQLCmd As String
   Dim cmd As New ADODB.Command
   Dim cmd2 As New ADODB.Command
   Dim adoRs As New ADODB.Recordset
   Dim adoRs2 As New ADODB.Recordset
   Dim prm As ADODB.Parameter
   Dim prm2 As ADODB.Parameter

   cn.Open "Provider=SQLOLEDB;Data Source=<<I>Your Server</I>>;" & _
                    "Initial Catalog=pubs;User ID=sa;pwd=;"

   cmd.ActiveConnection = cn
   cmd.CommandText = "byroyalty"
   cmd.CommandType = adCmdStoredProc

   Set prm = cmd.CreateParameter("Percentage", adInteger, adParamInput, 4, 40)
   cmd.Parameters.Append prm

   adoRs.CursorLocation = adUseServer
   adoRs.CursorType = adOpenStatic
   adoRs.LockType = adLockOptimistic

   Set adoRs = cmd.Execute

   cn2.Open "Provider=SQLOLEDB;Data Source=<<I>Your Server</I>>;" & _
                    "Initial Catalog=pubs;User ID=sa;pwd=;"

   cmd2.ActiveConnection = cn   'Use the cn2 connection to resolve the problem.
   cmd2.CommandText = "byroyalty"
   cmd2.CommandType = adCmdStoredProc

   Set prm2 = cmd.CreateParameter("Percentage", adInteger, adParamInput, 4, 40)
   cmd2.Parameters.Append prm

   adoRs2.CursorLocation = adUseServer
   adoRs2.CursorType = adOpenStatic
   adoRs2.LockType = adLockOptimistic

   Set adoRs2 = cmd2.Execute

5. Run the project. The execution of the second stored procedure will either
   fail silently, or return the error mentioned in the Symptoms section of this
   article.

6. Change the cmd2.ActiveConnection to use cn2 and run the project. The T-SQL
   Debugger should run correctly for both stored procedure calls.
