SUMMARY
=======

The generic Office 97 Offer and Welcome messages generated during first run of
Outlook 98 may not be desirable in their original form. This article describes
how to either disable these messages from being generated or modify the default
message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To disable the Offer and Welcome messages, before the first run of Outlook 98,
rename the Offer.msg and Welcome.msg files. These files are by default in the
following location:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office

The Offer.msg and Welcome.msg files are in HTML format. You can edit these files
with any editor capable of editing HTML, such as Microsoft Word or Outlook. In
most cases, if you double-click on a file with the extension of .msg, it will
open in Outlook. Our steps below assume that the file is opening up in Outlook.

To customize the Offer.msg or Welcome.msg files, do the following:

1. Locate and double-click the Offer.msg or Welcome.msg files in the folder
   listed above, or wherever Microsoft Office is installed on the computer.

2. On the Edit menu, click Edit Message.

3. Make the changes to the file, and then on the File menu, click Save. This
   will save the file in its current location with its current name.

4. Close the file.

A message can be created in any supported message format such as Rich Text Format
(.rtf), and saved to Welcome.msg and Offer.msg file name.
