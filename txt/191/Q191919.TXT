TITLE   :BUG: DataGrid Doesn't Handle Special Filter Constants Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0, 6.0 SP4, 6.0 SP5 
 - ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), versions 1.5, 2.0, 2.1 SP2, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the filter of an ADO Recordset object is set to one of the special
constants, such as adFilterPendingRecords, the bound DataGrid control still
displays all of the rows in the Recordset. If the filter is set to specify a
particular field, such as "State = 'CA'," the DataGrid displays only the rows
that are specific to that filter.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The code that follows filters based on a field and displays the appropriate data
in the grid.

Modifying records in the data grid and setting the Filter property of the
Recordset to display only records with pending changes (Filter =
adFilterPendingRecords) causes the recordset to correctly filter on those
changed records. However, the DataGrid does not correctly display the filtered
Recordset object.

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

1. Create a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, click References.

3. In the list of available references, click Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects
   Library.

4. On the Project menu, click Components.

5. In the list of available components, click Microsoft DataGrid Control 6.0
   (OLEDB).

6. Add a DataGrid control and two CommandButton controls to Form1.

7. Set the name and the caption properties of the CommandButton controls as
   follows:

    - Command1:
      Name = cmdFilterField
      Caption = FilterField

    - Command2:
      Name = cmdFilterPending
      Caption = FilterPending

8. Add the following code to the General Declarations of Form1:

         Dim rsAuthors As New ADODB.Recordset
         Private Sub cmdFilterField_Click()
           rsAuthors.Filter = adFilterNone
           rsAuthors.Filter = "State = 'UT'"
         End Sub

         Private Sub cmdFilterPending_Click()
           rsAuthors.Filter = adFilterNone
           rsAuthors.Filter = adFilterPendingRecords
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Load()
           Dim cnPubs As New ADODB.Connection
           Dim strConn As String

           ' You may have to change the following line
           ' to a valid SQL Server
           strConn = "Provider=SQLOLEDB;Data Source=(local);" & _
                    "Initial Catalog=pubs;"

           cnPubs.CursorLocation = adUseClient
           cnPubs.Open strConn, "sa", ""

           rsAuthors.Open "SELECT * FROM Authors", cnPubs, adOpenStatic, _
                     adLockBatchOptimistic

           Set rsAuthors.ActiveConnection = Nothing

           cnPubs.Close

           Set DataGrid1.DataSource = rsAuthors

         End Sub

9. Press the F5 key to run the application, and note the behavior of the
   different filter methods.
