TITLE   :PRB: Setup Wizard Leaves 200KB of Disk Space on 1.44 Floppies
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Visual FoxPro 6.0 Setup Wizard to generate 1.44MB floppy disk images,
approximately 200KB of disk space is unused on each disk that contains a .cab
file.

CAUSE
=====

The algorithms that calculate the .cab file size intentionally leave extra space
since the compression scheme is not exact.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start the Setup Wizard.

2. Point to your \VFP98\Wizards directory in Step 1 and click Next twice.

3. Choose a disk images directory, and ensure that the 1.44 MB 3.5-inch option
   is selected.

4. Click Next.

5. Enter the caption and copyright information and click Finish twice.

6. Copy the information from the folder on the hard drive to a floppy disk.

Note that each of the disks containing a .cab file have approximately 200KB of
available disk space.
