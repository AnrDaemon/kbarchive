TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Change Visual FoxPro Installation Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Visual FoxPro 6.0 on a computer that currently has Visual
FoxPro version 5.0a installed, you are presented with an option to uninstall the
existing Visual Studio '97 products with the updated 6.0 versions. Choosing
Visual FoxPro during this step of the Install Wizard does not allow you to
change the location for Visual FoxPro 6.0.

CAUSE
=====

You chose to replace your existing Visual FoxPro 5.0a installation with Visual
FoxPro 6.0. The setup program installs Visual FoxPro 6.0 in your old Visual
FoxPro 5.0a directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not select Visual FoxPro in the dialog box when asked which Visual Studio
products to uninstall.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install Visual FoxPro 5.0a

2. Start the Visual FoxPro 6.0 installation.

3. When you see the prompt for which products you wish to uninstall, choose
   Visual FoxPro.

4. Try and change the location for the Visual FoxPro 6.0 installation.

You cannot change the directory because Visual FoxPro 6.0 will be installed in
your existing Visual FoxPro 5.0a directory.
