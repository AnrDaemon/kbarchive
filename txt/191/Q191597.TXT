======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Outlook Web Access client to view an HTML note containing
multiple attachments that is published to a public folder, the attachments may
appear incorrectly. Viewing an item published to a public folder with a single
attachment will display correctly.

This behavior will occur only if the following conditions are met:

 - The custom HTML form is published to a public folder and contains multiple
   attachments.

   -and-

 - Permissions on the public folder are set to the following: Publishing Author,
   Author, Nonediting Author or Reviewer.

When you open the custom HTML note, selecting the Attachment tab will display the
attachments as a single attachment with the title "Untitled" rather than
correctly displaying the names of the multiple attachments.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correctly view each attachment, post the HTML form to the public folder with
single attachments, or open the form from the public folder with a standard
Outlook client.
