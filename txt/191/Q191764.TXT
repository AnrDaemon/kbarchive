Place the following code in a program file and run the program:

      LOCAL lnI

      MODIFY PROJECT test1 NOWAIT NOSHOW
      MODIFY PROJECT test2 NOWAIT NOSHOW
      ? "Active Project " + Application.ActiveProject.Name

      FOR lnI = 1 TO Application.Projects.Count
         ? "Project " + ALLTRIM(STR(lnI)) + " " + ;
             Application.Projects.Item(lnI).Name
      ENDFOR

      WAIT WINDOW "Note that project 1 is the active project!" TIME 1
      WAIT WINDOW "Now we are going to close project 1" TIME 1
      Application.Projects.Item(1).Close()
      WAIT WINDOW "Now lets check Application.ActiveProject." TIME 1
      ? Application.ActiveProject.Name

When the program executes the last line, the following error message appears:
