TITLE   :WINS Service Fails to Start With More Than 99 PNG Entries
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you enter more than 99 IP addresses in the PersonaNonGrata (PNG) value in the
registry, the WINS server will not start. Event ID 7023 and 4165 are logged to
the System Event Log on the WINS server.

NOTE: This problem can occur on a computer with Service Pack 4 installed if the
PersonaNonGrata list contains duplicate entries and there are more than 99 IP
addresses. Removing the duplicate entries will resolve the problem.

CAUSE
=====

Because of a buffer calculation, WINS is unable to handle the PNG buffer size
when creating the PNG key with more than 99 IP addresses. The buffer size
calculation has been reworked to handle more than 99 IP addresses.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
