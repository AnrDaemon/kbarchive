SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how you can remove a catalog from the Component Gallery
view.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are creating a catalog in the Component Gallery, a table (.dbf &
.fpt) is actually created. There are three ways in which you can remove the
catalog from the view of the Component Gallery.

 - Select the catalog and right-click to open the shortcut menu, and then select
   Remove. This removes the catalog from the current view of Component Gallery.

   -or-

 - Select the Options button on the toolbar to go into the Component Gallery
   Options dialog box. Select the Catalogs tab. In the list box, select the name
   of the catalog you wish to remove. Select the Default check box to clear the
   check box, then click OK to exit from the Component Gallery Options dialog.
   The catalog is removed from the view of the Component Gallery the next time
   you re-start Component Gallery. This option disables the auto-load of the
   catalog the next time you start Component Gallery.

   -or-

 - Deleting the catalog table from the computer's hard drive permanently removes
   the catalog from the component Gallery.
