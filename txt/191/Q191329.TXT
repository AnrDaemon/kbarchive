The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install the Package Command Manager (PCM) service
on computers running Windows NT Workstation, without using the RSERVICE utility.
The MORE INFORMATION section of this article contains:

 - The steps for installing PCM as a service without using RSERVICE.

 - A sample script illustrating how this would look for installing the service
   to the c:\PCMSVC directory in a domain called "ABC_Domain", with a PCM
   service account name of "PCM_Service" with a password of "anything".

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install PCM as a service, without using RSERVICE, perform the following
steps:

1. Create a source directory containing the following utilities from the
   Resource Kit:

    - Regini.exe (used to add registry entries for the service logs)
    - Ntrights.exe (used to give the service account the proper rights)
    - Instsrv.exe (used to install the service)
    - Pcmsvc32.exe (the actual service executable to be installed)

2. Create a batch file a file name that describes its purpose (for example,
   Instlpcm.bat).

3. Add the following to your batch file, replacing the name of your domain,
   service account, and the service account password where applicable. This
   batch file is written to install the PCM service from drive A and install it
   to drive C. You can change this to the desired location from where to run the
   batch file and/or where you want to install the PCM service, respectively.

      -----------------INSTLPCM.BAT------------------------------
      REM InstlPCM.bat

      REM Add SMS related registry entries
      a:\regini.exe a:\regfix.ini

      REM Add ABC_DOMAIN\PCM_SERVICE account to the workstation's
      REM Administrators local group

      NET localgroup administrators /add ABC_DOMAIN\PCM_SERVICE

      REM On the workstation, assign Logon As A Service rights to PCM_SERVICE
      REM account
      NTRIGHTS -u ABC_DOMAIN\PCM_SERVICE +r SeServiceLogonRight

      REM Copy PCMSVC32.EXE to the workstation
      MD c:\pcmsvc
      COPY a:\pcmsvc32.exe c:\pcmsvc

      REM Install the PCM Service
      a:\instsrv.exe SMS_PACKAGE_COMMAND_MANAGER_NT C:\PCMSVC\PCMSVC32.EXE -a
      ABC_DOMAIN\PCM_SERVICE -p anything

      REM Start the PCM Service
      NET start SMS_PACKAGE_COMMAND_MANAGER_NT
      ----------------------------end of batch file------------------------

4. Create the REGINI initialization file. This is the file that REGINI reads to
   add the appropriate registry entries. The entries in the .ini file are shown
   below. These entries assume that you have installed the service to the
   c:\PCMSVC directory.

   \registry\machine\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Identification
                     Installation Directory = REG_SZ C:\PCMSVC

   \registry\machine\Software\Microsoft\SMS\TRACING
                     Enabled = REG_SZ 1

   \registry\machine\Software\Microsoft\SMS\TRACING
   \SMS_PACKAGE_COMMAND_MANAGER_NT
                     Enabled = REG_SZ 1

   \registry\machine\Software\Microsoft\SMS\TRACING
   \SMS_PACKAGE_COMMAND_MANAGER_NT
                     TraceFilename = REG_SZ C:\pcmsvc\LOGS\pacman.log

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

5. Copy the batch file and .ini file to your source directory.

6. Log on to the workstation with an account that has administrator rights and
   run the batch file. This will install and start the service.
