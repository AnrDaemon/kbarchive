TITLE   :BUG: Conversion from OS/390 PACKED to DECIMAL and NUMERIC Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, version 1.0, included with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to display an IBM OS/390 packed decimal record field as converted to
the DECIMAL or NUMERIC automation type results in errors. The first
manifestation, generally, is that there is no data to display, for example, in a
Visual Basic text box.

WORKAROUND
==========

Packed decimal fields can be converted to a string (DBTYPE_STR, CHAR)
successfully.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the OLE DB Provider for AS/400
and VSAM component of Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 SP1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An attempt to convert an IBM OS/390 packed decimal record field to either the
NUMERIC (DBTYPE_NUMERIC) or DECIMAL (DBTYPE_DECIMAL) automation types results in
the following error manifestations. They are seen when running a Visual Basic
consumer in debug mode.

1. A watch is added for the ADO recordset, and the value of the numeric field is
   set to "Errors occurred".

2. When an immediate statement to view the numeric field s executed, for
   example, "? RS.Fields(10).Value<enter>," the following message box
   appears:

   

            Title Bar: Microsoft Visual Basic
            Description: HRESULT 80040e21 (-2147217887)
                         Errors occurred.

3. An attempt to display this field/column in a text box yields either blanks or
   nothing.

4. Issuing an ADO GetRows results in an error being returned from OLE DB
   Provider with the same HRESULT, -2147217887 (0x80040e21) and the description
   "Automation error."
