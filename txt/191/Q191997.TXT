TITLE   :BUG: BackColor/ForeColor of Grid Not Carried Over to Subclass
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When changing the BackColor or ForeColor properties of a grid class's header in
the Class Designer to some other color, the grid header remains in the default
color after subclassing the class on to a new form.

RESOLUTION
==========

 - Create the grid class definition through code, then add the grid to the form
   using the AddObject method. Please see step 1 in the Workaround section for
   further instruction.

   -or-

 - Change the Backcolor or ForeColor properties of the Header in the subclassing
   grid.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The behavior as described in the SYMPTOMS section, does not occur if the grid is
created through code rather than using the class designer.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Grid class in Class Designer, named the class mygrid and save the
   class in myclass library.

2. Change the ColumnCount property of the grid to 1.

3. Go to the header object of the grid and change the following properties of
   the header object:

   " BackColor = 255,0,0 ForeColor = 0,255,0 " (without the quotation marks)

4. Close the class designer.

5. Create a new form in a form designer, named myform.

6. Add the myclass class library to the Form Controls toolbar.

7. Select mygrid from the toolbar and place it onto the form.

The Header of the grid object shows up as default color, which is gray for the
backcolor and black for the forecolor.

Workaround
----------

1. Create a program (.prg) named Gridclass.prg and put the following code in the
   .prg file:

         DEFINE CLASS grid1 AS Grid
            ADD OBJECT column11 AS column1
         ENDDEFINE

         DEFINE CLASS column1 AS Column
            Width = 120
            ADD OBJECT header11 AS header1
         ENDDEFINE

         DEFINE CLASS header1 AS Header
            ForeColor = rgb(0,255,0)
            BackColor=rgb(255,0,0)
         ENDDEFINE

2. Create a form and in the Init event of the form place the following code:

         SET PROCEDURE TO gridclass.prg
         Thisform.AddObject("mygrid","grid1")
         Thisform.mygrid.Visible = .T.

3. Run the form and the grid header shows up with the backcolor and forecolor
   you expect.
