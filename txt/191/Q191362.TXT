TITLE   :FPNW Pass-Through Authentication from Trusted Domain May Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Services for NetWare version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A hotfix was built that changes the functionality of how File and Print Services
for NetWare (FPNW) clients running login scripts that contain IF MEMBER_OF
statements work when run from FPNW servers participating in a master domain
model and using pass-through authentication to validate group membership. This
validation may fail if the primary domain controller (PDC) in the trusted domain
is down.

Please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base to understand
the functionality change of the hotfix referenced in this article that does not
work properly when the PDC of the Trusted Domain is down:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q150733
   TITLE : FPNW Groups Not Recognized from Trusted Domain

CAUSE
=====

The FPNW server queries the trusted domain's domain controller when doing
pass-through authentication. The API that the FPNW server was calling only
queried the primary domain controller. The FPNW server now makes an API call
that queries any domain controller.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
