======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Dial-Up Networking 1.3 Upgrade, the Dial-Up Networking
Server utility does not work.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Dial-Up Networking 1.3 Upgrade uninstalls
the Dial-Up Networking Server utility.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, reinstall the Dial-Up Networking Server utility if you
want to continue using it. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Add/Remove Programs.

2. Click the Windows Setup tab, click Communications (the word, not the check
   box), and then click Details.

3. Click the Dial-Up Networking Server check box to select it, click OK, and
   then restart your computer. Note that this also installs the Direct Cable
   Connection utility if it is not already installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Dial-Up Networking 1.3 Upgrade Setup program deletes the Rnaserv.dll file.
