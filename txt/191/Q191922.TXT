SYMPTOMS
========

When a you try to run Jetpack.exe on the Jet database of a Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server on a computer running Windows NT Server
version 4.0, you may receive the following error message:

   Jetpack failed with error = -1605

When compacting the database using Jetpack, a Jet database duplicate key error
-1605 may occur. This error occurs when addresses are marked bad and a unique
value is not used for the media access control hardware address associated with
the bad IP addresses.

This problem may go away temporarily if you delete the database and reconcile.
This problem may also result in the DHCP server ceasing to respond (hanging).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
