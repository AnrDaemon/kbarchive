The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0, on platform(s):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After creating distribution files using the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW)
and then attempting to install the application on a Windows 95, Windows 98, or
Windows Me computer, you may receive the following error:

   Unable to load file "msdadc.dll" to register it

Alternatively, you may see the error:

   DLL registration failed

CAUSE
=====

Installation of Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) requires installation of
DCOM. Setup programs created with the Package and Deployment Wizard use the MDAC
installer program, Mdac_typ.exe, to install the Microsoft Data Access
Components, which include OLE DB, ADO, and Jet. Mdac_typ.exe requires that the
target machine have DCOM installed on it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To fix this problem, install DCOM on the target machine. Either DCOM95 or DCOM98
can be used. The latest version of DCOM95 can be found at the following Web
address:

   Microsoft COM at http://www.microsoft.com/com

Alternatively, DCOM98 can be installed by running DCOM98.exe found in the DCOM98
folder on the Visual Basic 6.0 CD-ROM, Disk 1. Please note that DCOM98 can
install DCOM on both Windows 95 and Windows 98 machines.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
