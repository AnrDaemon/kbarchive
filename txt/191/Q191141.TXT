SUMMARY
=======

 

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to access the Internet Service Manager (HTML) from a Web browser that
does not reside on the Web server itself, you may receive the following error
message:

   HTTP Error 403 - Access to Internet Service Manager (HTML) is
   restricted to Localhost

   403.6 Forbidden: IP address rejected

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by the default security settings for the Internet Service
Manager (HTML). In order to ensure that the site is not inadvertently exposed to
an attack, the HTML Administrator is set to only allow the local IP address
(127.0.0.1) access to it.

WORKAROUND
==========

To change the security settings, perform the following steps:

1. Open the Internet Service Manager and click the Directory Security tab.

2. Click the Edit button next to the IP Address and Domain Name Restrictions
   heading.

3. Choose the IP address, group of IP addresses, or domain names that you want
   to have access to the HTML Internet Service Manager.
