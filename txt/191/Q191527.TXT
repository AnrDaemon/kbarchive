SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to implement GenHTML functionality in Visual FoxPro
6.0 run-time applications (including APPs, EXEs, DLLs, and so forth).

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Add the GenHTML.prg file to your project. GenHTML.prg is located in the
   Visual FoxPro root directory specified by HOME().

2. Add the _HTML.vcx file to your project. The _HTML.vcx class library is
   located in the Visual FoxPro Foundation Classes (FFC) directory specified by
   HOME()+"FFC\".

3. If you plan to use any of the Web Wizard data page output layouts at
   run-time, you must also add the _HTMLSty.vcx file to your project. The
   _HTMLSty.vcx class library is located in the Visual FoxPro FFC directory
   specified by HOME()+"FFC\". If you add the _HTMLSty.vcx file to your project,
   you need to add the following two lines of code to your startup program in
   order to avoid a project build error:

         FUNCTION taFields()
         ENDFUNC

4. Generally, when you call GenHTML you do it by executing the following line:

         DO (_GENHTML) WITH <params>

   The default value of _GENHTML in the development version of Visual FoxPro is
   HOME()+"GENHTML.PRG". In run-time applications, you should manually set
   _GENHTML="GENHTML.PRG" at the start of your application so that the
   GENHTML.PRG program included in your application is properly executing at
   run-time using the same DO (_GENHTML) WITH <params> commands.

5. Build the project into an APP, EXE, or DLL. Note that the _Base.vcx class
   library is automatically added to your project if it did not already exist in
   the project.
