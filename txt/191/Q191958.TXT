TITLE   :SMS: SMS_Site_Config_Manager Appears to Stop Responding
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSCMan smssiteconfigman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Systems Management Server site server, the site properties are not being
updated. There is at least one .ct1 file in the Sms\Site.srv\Sitecfg.box
directory waiting to be processed.

The SMS_Site_Config_Manager service appears to stop responding, because the
Scman.log file is not being updated. However, when you stop the service for the
SMS_Site_Config_Manager service, an entry in the Scman.log shows "~Service is
stopping". Therefore, you can tell that the service has not actually stopped
responding; rather, it is waiting on a pending operation that is never
completed.

NOTE: The Logon Server files are not updated if the registry of the logon server
is full.

WORKAROUND
==========

Upon restarting the SMS_Site_Config_Manager service and monitoring the
Scman.log, you will notice it processing until it reaches the same point. Make
note of the Systems Management Server logon server that was being last
processed.

When you know the logon server, try to remote control it, or manually go to it.
If a message appears on the screen that mentions "{Low on Registry Quota}", you
may be experiencing the symptoms outlined in the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q176083 System Is Running Low on Registry Quota

After adjusting the size of the registry and restarting that server,
SMS_Site_Config_Manager is able to process that server successfully.
