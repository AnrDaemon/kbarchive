TITLE   :Group Policies Cause Excessive \PIPE\samr Connections on PDC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running Server Manager or User Manager for Domains results in the following
error message:

   Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service.
   Do you want to select another domain to administer?

The primary domain controller (PDC) shows \PIPE\samr connections in excess of
2,048. Rebooting the PDC temporarily alleviates the problem.

CAUSE
=====

When a user logs on to a domain in which group policies are implemented, a
\PIPE\samr connection is established with the PDC to verify group membership for
this user. After the verification process, the \PIPE\samr connection is not
released. These \PIPE\samr connections eventually exceed the limit of 2,048.

After this limit is reached, no new processes requiring security account manager
(SAM) access can connect to the PDC until you restart the computer. Server
Manager and User Manager for Domains require a connection to the PDC for domain
administration. Their failure to make this connection results in the preceding
error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
