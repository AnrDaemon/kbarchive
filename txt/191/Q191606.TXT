TITLE   :Dell 3c905b Oemsetup.inf File Has Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Dell is shipping new 3C905B network adapter cards. This driver's Oemsetup.inf
does not work properly in conjunction with an unattended installation of Windows
NT Server or Workstation 4.0. The Oemsetup.inf file exhibits no problems if
installation is done using the OEM-supplied floppy disks, but will affect
installation if done during an unattended installation. Setup will hang during
an unattended installation when it attempts to load network drivers.

CAUSE
=====

The original Oemsetup.inf file does not support unattended installations. During
the unattended installation, setup searches for files in an incorrect location
(path,) which prevents the loading of the correct driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

Dell has rewritten the Oemsetup.inf file for the 3C905B network interface card.
Please contact Dell support for the updated file.
