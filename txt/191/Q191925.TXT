TITLE   :Automatic Logon Fails Using 5250 Applet
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MORE INFORMATION
================

For detailed information about installation and architecture of Host Security,
see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q175063, "Host Security Integration
Setup and Architectural Overview."

Steps to Reproduce the Problem:

The steps below assume a Host Security Domain is installed and correctly
configured.

1. In SNA Server Manager, configure two connections to a single AS/400. Two
   remote APPC LUs should be configured, one for each connection. A single local
   APPC LU is acceptable.

2. In SNA Server Manager, assign only one of the connections to the Host
   Security Domain.

3. Save the configuration file and restart SNA Server.

4. Start the 5250 applet, select the connection assigned to the Host Security
   Domain, and select Automatic Logon. Attempt to connect to the AS/400. The
   connection is successful.

5. Disconnect from the AS/400 and reconfigure the session. Select the connection
   that is not assigned to the Host Security Domain and leave Automatic Logon
   selected. Try to connect to the AS/400. The session fails with the following
   message:

   "The SNA session is unavailable [0010][00000000]."

   In the Windows NT Server Application Event Log, the following is logged:

   Event 38
   APPC session deactivated abnormally
   Qualifier
   0003 and Event 90
   APPC protocol violation
   Sense data=0C001110

SYMPTOMS
========

Automatic Logon using the 5250 applet can fail even though a Host Security
Domain has been successfully configured.

CAUSE
=====

Host Security Domains require assignment of connections for correct operation.
Session configuration of the 5250 applet allows user selection of Automatic
Logon and connection. Automatic Logon fails if the connection selected by the
user is not assigned to the Host Security Domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, assign all connections in the SNA Subdomain to the Host
Security Domain. SNA Server must be restarted for the change to take effect.
This allows Automatic Logon over all connections.
