TITLE   :XWEB: Mailbox Hidden from GAL Not Usable in Outlook Web Access
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Outlook Web Access (OWA) client to try to open your mailbox,
you cannot do so. Logging on with your mailbox name returns the following error
message:

   OWA was unable to get your inbox.
   To try to logon again, click here.

Repeated attempts to log on fail, whether you use your mailbox alias or your full
SMTP address in the log-on dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

Your mailbox has been configured to be hidden from the address book in the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program. This option is selected in the
properties for the mailbox. On the Advanced tab, the "Hide from address book"
option is selected.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, clear the "Hide from address book" option in the
properties for the mailbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because OWA uses a MAPI session for name resolution, a "hidden" recipient cannot
be resolved to a user name. This is by design.
