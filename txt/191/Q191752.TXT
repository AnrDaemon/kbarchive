TITLE   :PRB: DataRepeater Control's RepeaterBindings List Is Empty
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The PropertyName drop-down combo box on the RepeaterBindings tab of the
DataRepeater control's property page is empty.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by not marking the desired properties of the data
bound control shown in the DataRepeater control as data bound.

RESOLUTION
==========

Follow step 6 of "Creating a Data Bound User Control for use in the Data
Repeater Control" in the Help topic "Using the DataRepeater Control" which
says:

   "Use the Procedure Attributes dialog box to make the properties data- bound.
   On the Tools menu click Procedure Attributes.

   On the Procedures Attributes dialog box, click Advanced. The Name box contains
   the property you want to make data-bound, and should contain ProductName.
   Click Property is data-bound, then click Show in DataBindings collection at
   design time. Click the Name box and click UnitPrice. Once again, click
   Property is data-bound, then click Show in DataBindings collection at
   design-time. Click OK to close the dialog box."

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
