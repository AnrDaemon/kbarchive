TITLE   :Services for Macintosh Index Corruption on Large Volumes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use File Services for the Macintosh, Macintosh users may report that
files and/or directories that were previously visible are no longer visible from
Macintosh clients. When viewed on the server itself or by PC clients, the files
are viewable.

CAUSE
=====

This issue was caused by the index not being updated with all of the change
notifications that were occurring as a result of the Macintosh clients making
changes to files. There was also a problem where, if the server was restarted
because of a Window NT blue screen, loss of power, or a hard power-down without
properly shutting down the server through the Windows UI, the index would not be
rebuilt correctly when the server was restarted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
