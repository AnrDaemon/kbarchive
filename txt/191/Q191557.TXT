SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to increase the level of difficulty in a
single-player game of Microsoft Motocross Madness.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To increase the level of difficulty in a single-player game of Motocross
Madness, disable the Automatic Level Of Difficulty (ALOD) feature.

The ALOD feature is designed to limit the Artificial Intelligence (AI) of
computer-generated opponents. This feature is enabled by default when you start
the game.

To disable the ALOD feature, press CTRL+A. When you do this, a PLUS SIGN (+) is
displayed briefly in the lower-left corner of the screen. To reenable ALOD,
press CTRL+A again. When you do this, a MINUS SIGN (-) is displayed briefly in
the lower-left corner of the screen.

Enabling ALOD slows down computer-generated opponents when they are too far ahead
of you. Conversely, disabling ALOD increases the skill of computer-generated
opponents, making them more difficult for you to lap.
