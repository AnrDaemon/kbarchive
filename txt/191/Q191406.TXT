CAUSE
=====

The driver queried the Microsoft Exchange server to obtain the appointments for
the Outlook Calendar and incorrectly determined that it had received all of the
appointments, even if more were available.


STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Msoutl32.dll version
8.2:1.4308.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
