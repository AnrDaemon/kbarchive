-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to import multiple Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) files in
Microsoft Clip Gallery, Clip Gallery may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE

The CGM import filter (Cgmimp32.flt) that ships with Microsoft Publisher 97 or
Microsoft Publisher 98 does not support importing multiple CGM files.

individually.

If you have Microsoft Office 97 installed on your computer, you can install the
CGM import filter from the Office compact disc. This version of the CGM import
filter supports importing multiple CGM files in Clip Gallery. To install this
filter, follow these steps:

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. In the list of installed programs, click either "Microsoft Office 97,
   Professional Edition" or "Microsoft Office 97, Standard Edition." Click
   Add/Remove.

4. In the Maintenance Mode dialog box, click Add/Remove.

5. Click Converters And Filters and then click Change Option.

6. Click Graphics Filters and then click Change Option.

7. Click to select Computer Graphics Metafile Import and then click OK.

8. Click OK again. Click Continue and follow the instructions on your screen.
