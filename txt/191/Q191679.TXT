TITLE   :FIX: Wrong Line Number Information Debugging STL
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINNT:5.0sp3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDebug kbVC500bug kbVC600fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Integrated Debugger, included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0sp3 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0sp3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to debug a program that uses STL template classes, the debugger may
point to the wrong line in the source file.

CAUSE
=====

The Compiler is generating incorrect line-number information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual C++, version
6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Sample Code
-----------

      //test.cpp
      #include <vector>
      int main()
      {
      int a, b ;
      a=10;
      std::vector<int>  v; //Incorrect debug line-number info for this line.
      b=5;
      return 0;
      }
      //end test.cpp

1. Create a Console Application project and add test.cpp to the project.

2. Make a debug build of the project.

3. Start stepping over each line of code by using F10.

RESULTS: After the "a=10;" line, the cursor points to the last line of test.cpp.

Pressing F10 again takes the cursor back to "b=5;" line.
