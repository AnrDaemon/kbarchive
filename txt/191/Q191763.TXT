SUMMARY
=======

Abbreviating the NOSHOW clause in the MODIFY PROJECT or CREATE PROJECT commands
cause the following error:

   Command contains unrecognized phrase/keyword.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MODIFY PROJECT and CREATE PROJECT commands have a new clause, NOSHOW, that
can prevent the display of the Project Manager. If the NOSHOW clause is
abbreviated to less than five characters, it is confused with the NOSHADOW
command which can cause the preceding error to occur.

The following command causes the error to occur:

      MODIFY PROJECT myproj NOSH

The following commands do not cause the error:

      MODIFY PROJECT myproj NOSHO
      MODIFY PROJECT myproj NOSHOW
