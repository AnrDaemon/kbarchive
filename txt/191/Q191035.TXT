TITLE   :BUG: Changes to WebClass Templates Are Not Always Detected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhtml kbide kbInternet kbVBp kbVBp600bug kbWebClasses kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When working on an HTML template in the WebClass designer, changes to the HTML
file made outside of Visual Basic are normally detected when returning to the
Visual Basic IDE. If the file is edited by selecting "Edit HTML Template..."
from the template's context menu (displayed on right-click) then, upon return to
Visual Basic, you are prompted to refresh the file. However, in some cases, you
are not prompted to refresh the template after you return to Visual Basic.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The most common cause of this problem is setting focus to a window other than
the WebClass designer in the Visual Basic IDE before switching to the external
editor. Upon return to Visual Basic, if the focus is not on the designer window,
then the prompt will not appear.

In certain cases, external changes will not be detected and developers should
always make certain to reload their changes when returning to the IDE. If the
prompt does not appear, then this can be done by selecting "Refresh HTML
Template" from the template's context menu. If the HTML file is not reloaded
after making external changes and the project is later saved, then those changes
could be overwritten.
