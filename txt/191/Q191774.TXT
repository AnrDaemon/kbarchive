The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 includes a utility called DMACheck (Dmacheck.exe)
that lets you view the (Direct Memory Access) DMA usage on your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information is listed for each IDE/ATAPI Channel detected:

Current DMA Usage
-----------------

This value indicates whether DMA is currently being used for each channel. There
are 3 possible values:

 - DMA In Use indicates that DMA transfers are being used on this channel.

 - DMA Not In Use indicates that DMA transfers are not being used on this
   channel and that the IDE/ATAPI driver is defaulting to Programmed I/O (PIO)
   transfer methods.

 - No IDE/ATAPI Devices Detected indicates that the utility could not read the
   status of that channel from the registry, either because there was no
   IDE/ATAPI device present or because the current user has insufficient
   privileges to access the registry. These settings cannot be changed and are
   dependent on the DMA support provided by your hardware and the value of the
   DMA detection settings.

DMA Detection Status
--------------------

This setting indicates whether the ATAPI driver will attempt to detect and use
DMA support on a given channel.

If DMA detection is disabled on a channel, the ATAPI driver defaults to PIO
transfers on that channel. If DMA detection is enabled on a channel, the ATAPI
driver queries the hardware for DMA support and if it is detected uses DMA for
data transfers.

If the hardware does not correctly support DMA transfers, PIO is used even if DMA
detection is enabled.

When the utility initially starts, radio buttons indicate the current settings
for each channel. To change the detection status, click the preferred setting
and it is saved when you exit DMACheck.

How to Obtain DMACheck
