-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Microsoft Urban Assault, the game may stop responding
(hang) after the introductory movie is played.

You may also receive an error message similar to the following:

   The instruction at 0423dl0x001 reference memory at 0x00000017 memory could
   not be read.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you do not have a sound card or if the sound card
installed in your computer is disabled. Urban Assault requires that a
Windows-compatible sound card be installed in your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, verify that your sound card is installed and functioning
properly. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

4. Double-click Sound, Video And Game Controllers to expand the branch.

If you do not see a Sound, Video And Game Controllers entry, or if no sound card
is listed under this entry, verify that a sound card is installed in your
computer. If a sound card is installed in the computer, contact the manufacturer
of the computer or the sound card and request help reinstalling the sound card
drivers.

If a sound card is listed under the Sound, Video And Game Controllers branch, but
you see a red X beside the sound card, follow these steps:

1. Click the sound card, and then click Properties.

2. On the General tab, click to select the Original Configuration check box. If
   you do not see an Original Configuration check box, click to clear the
   Disable In This Hardware Profile check box.

   NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Windows 98, click Enable Device.

3. Click OK.

4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all other sound cards listed with a red X.

5. Click Close, and then close Control Panel.

======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Urban Assault, version
