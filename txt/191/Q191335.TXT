TITLE   :SMS: Some Clients Get Event ID 7022 After Applying SP3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During startup, some client computers running Windows NT may generate an event
ID 7022 when the SMS Remote Control Agent service attempts to start. Manual
attempts to start the service fail with a "Failed to initialize network" error
message, followed by the following:

   Error Msg: Could not start the SMS Remote Control Agent service on
   \\<machine>.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if the Systems Management Server site property setting
for Windows NT Remote Control is configured to use a protocol that is not
installed on the Windows NT target system.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the default Remote Control protocol to an
option that is supported by the protocols installed in the network environment
and on all of the Windows NT systems. To do this, open the Systems Management
Server Administrator utility and do the following:

1. Open Site Properties and click Clients.

2. Select Proposed Properties and click Options.

3. For "Default RC Protocol for NT Clients", choose IP Sockets.

4. Update the site and wait for this change to show as Current. After it is
   confirmed, the client computers running Windows NT will need to be upgraded
   for this change to take effect. For more information, see the following
