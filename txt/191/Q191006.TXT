======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The FlexGrid control is limited to 350,000 total cells. This limitation differs
from the limitation that is documented in the FlexGrid Help file. The Help file
states the following:

   "The minimum number of rows and columns is 0. The maximum number is limited
   by the memory available on your computer."

Although this statement is true for the Hierarchical FlexGrid control
(MSHFLXGD.OCX), it is incorrect for the FlexGrid control (MSFLXGRD.OCX).

MORE INFORMATION
================

This limitation of 350,000 cells occurs on any computer, regardless of the
memory that is available. Thus, if you have two columns, the maximum amount of
rows that you can have is 175,000. Similarly, if you have five columns, the
maximum amount of rows that you can have is 70,000. If any combination of rows
and columns exceeds 350,000 total cells, you receive the following error
message:

   Unable to Allocate Memory for FlexGrid

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Click Components on the Project menu, and then select the "Microsoft FlexGrid
   Control 6.0" check box.

3. Add a FlexGrid control to Form1.

4. Set the Cols property of MSFlexGrid1 to 2 in the Properties window.

5. Set the Rows property of MSFlexGrid1 to 175,001 in the Properties window (the
   maximum it allows in this case is 175,000). You receive the following error
   message:

   Unable to Allocate Memory for FlexGrid
