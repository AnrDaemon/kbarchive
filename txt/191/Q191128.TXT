SYMPTOMS
========

CListCtrl member functions GetItem and SetItem lack an Indent parameter.

CAUSE
=====

The LVITEM structure was modified with version 4.70 of ComCtrl32.dll to include
an indent parameter. This parameter specifies how many image widths to indent an
item. However, there is no place to specify this parameter in the form of the
CListCtrl member function SetItem that takes a list view item's attributes.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can set the value of the iIndent member of the LVITEM structure by using the
form of the CListCtrl member function SetItem that accepts a pointer to a
LV_ITEM structure. For example:

      void CMyCListCtrl::SetItemIndent( int nItem, int nIndent )
      {
         LV_ITEM lvi;

         lvi.iItem = nItem;
         lvi.iSubItem = 0;
         lvi.mask = LVIF_INDENT;
         lvi.iIndent = nIndent;

         VERIFY( SetItem( &lvi ) );
      }

Likewise, to obtain the indentation of an item in a CListCtrl, use the form of
the CListCtrl member function GetItem that accepts a pointer to a LV_ITEM
structure:

      int CMyCListCtrl::GetItemIndent( int nItem )
      {
         LV_ITEM lvi;

         lvi.iItem = nItem;
         lvi.iSubItem = 0;
         lvi.mask = LVIF_INDENT;

         VERIFY( GetItem( &lvi ) );

         return lvi.iIndent;
      }

Note that because iIndent specifies the number of image widths to indent the
item, you must associate an image list of small images with the items.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CListCtrl::SetItem has two forms: one that takes a pointer to an LV_ITEM
structure and one that takes individual parameters. The second form does not
have a parameter representing the number of image widths to indent an item.

Additional query words: LVITEM LV_ITEM LVM_SETITEM LVM_GETITEM CListView
