SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose to print even pages or odd pages, Word does not print the
correct pages. This behavior occurs when you include page numbers that are
numbered differently from the physical pages in the document (for example, when
the first page of your document is defined as page 2, the second page is defined
as page 3, and so forth). In addition, this behavior occurs whether or not you
choose a section start equal to odd or even pages.

CAUSE
=====

Word looks to the physical pages in your document to determine which pages are
odd and even. Word does not reference any logical page numbering placed in your
document.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correctly print pages that have odd or even page numbers, you can add a blank
page to the beginning of your section or document. When you do this, the
physical page numbers and the logical page numbers are equivalent.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
