MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Make sure that you have at least two printers installed. For this example,
   the following printers are used:

   HP LJ4L (called "LaserJet")
   Panasonic KX-P1624 (called "Panasonic KX-P1624").
   The LaserJet is the default Windows printer.

2. Execute the following code and follow the commented instructions:

         =SYS(1037) && choose the Panasonic.
         =SYS(1037) && choose the LaserJet.
         CREATE REPORT Test

3. Save the report and close it.

4. Run the following code from the Command window and note the contents of the
   memo fields:

         USE Test.FRX
         MODIFY MEMO Tag, Tag2

After the name "LaserJet", there are some left over letters from the Panasonic
printer. Please note that if the second printer chosen has a longer name than
the first, this does not seem to happen.
