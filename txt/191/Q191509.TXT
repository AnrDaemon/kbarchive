SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use Pinpointer or Word Search to search for articles in
Encarta Encyclopedia, Encarta may not find some of the words you type in the
search box.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for the following reasons:

 - To improve search performance and results, Encarta ignores common
   prepositions and pronouns in Word Search queries.

 - Encarta uses the words "and," "or," "not," and "thru" for special search
   functions when you type them without quotation marks. Encarta ignores these
   words when you type them within quotation marks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Encarta ignores the following words when you type a search phrase:

Search Tips
-----------

When you perform a Word Search in Encarta, you can use the following words to
modify the results of your search:

   Word   Usage      Purpose
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   And    X And Y    Find articles that contain both X and Y.

   Or     X Or Y     Find articles that contain either X or Y or both.

   Near   X Near Y   Find articles that contain both X and Y within eight
                     words of each other.

   Not    X Not Y    Find articles that contain X and do not contain Y.

   Thru   X Thru Y   Find articles that contain X, Y, or any word that
                     falls alphabetically between X and Y.

   NOTE: When you use "Thru" in a Word Search in Encarta, you may have to wait a
   long time before Encarta returns the search results.
