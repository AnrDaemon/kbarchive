TITLE   :Stop 0x1E Switching Between System Menus in Application Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a child window of the main window is created in a separate UI thread and
the child window has the WS_SYSMENU style, when you switch to the child window's
system menu by pressing the right arrow, the system stops responding and,
eventually, after switching between other applications, the following blue
screen STOP message may occur:

   STOP: 0x0000001E (0xC0000005, 0xA000E0DC, 0x00000001, 0x000000E4)
   KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED
   win32k.sys

For example, if an MDI child window is running on a separate thread and you
select a menu item, such as the File menu, and then press the right arrow key,
the frame or application's system menu will appear (that is, where you move,
size, minimize, maximize, and so on). If you press the right arrow key again,
the child window's system menu will appear. After you arrow down, the menu items
are not highlighted as expected. When you switch (press ALT+TAB) to another
application, the system menu remains on top and does not redraw properly.

RESOLUTION
==========
