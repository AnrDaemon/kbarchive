TITLE   :Error Appears Behind C2 Security Config Tool Splash Screen
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the C2 Configuration utility from the Terminal Server compact Disc,
an error dialog may appear behind the Security Manager splash screen. However,
at most display resolutions, it is impossible to see the error, or to drag it
into view.

CAUSE
=====

The Section header "[C2 Security Items]" (no quotation marks) in the
c2config.inf file should read, "[Security Items]" (no quotation marks). The
incorrect header causes the error to appear.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Copy the files from the Windows Terminal Server 4.0 compact disc
   \Support\Sectool\Alpha or from the I386 folder, to a folder on your hard disk
   drive.

2. Edit the C2Config.Inf file and change "[C2 Security Items]" to "[Security
   Items]" (no quotation marks).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows Terminal Server 4.0.

Additional query words: security tool
