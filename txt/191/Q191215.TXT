PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode kberrmsg kbCompiler kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual Basic, although the Print method exists on the Printer and Form
objects, it does not work within a With-block. The Print method is also not
listed in the Object Browser.

When you try to invoke the Print statement within a With-block, the following
error occurs when you run the program:

   Compile error: Method or data object not found

CAUSE
=====

The problem arises because Visual Basic is not parsing the Print identifier
within the With statement correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the Print method from the With-block.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

            Printer.Print "Test"  ' this works
            Printer.EndDoc

            With Printer
               .CurrentX = Printer.ScaleWidth / 2
               .CurrentY = Printer.ScaleHeight / 2
               .Print "Test"      ' this does not work

            End With
