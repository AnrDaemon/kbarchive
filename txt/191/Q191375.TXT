SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how you can check the version of ActiveX Data Objects
(ADO) you have installed on your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the COMCLASSINFO() function that is new in Visual FoxPro 6.0 to
return the ProgId of an object, which indicates the version of the object. You
can use the following code to check the installed version of ADO:

      x=CREATEOBJECT("adodb.recordset")
      ? COMCLASSINFO(x,1)

If ADODB.Recordset 2.0 is returned, you have ADO version 2.0 installed.

The COMCLASSINFO() function can also return the object's
VersionIndependentProgID, the object's friendly name and the object's class
identifier or CLSID.

The same information can be returned about Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel or
practically any other application for which an object reference can be created.

Another way to check the version of ADO is to check the version property of the
ADO.Connection object. The following code can be used to accomplish this:

      x=CREATEOBJECT("adodb.connection)
      ? x.version

If ADO 2.0 is the current version, 2.0 is returned. If ADO 1.5 is the current
version, 1.5 is returned.
