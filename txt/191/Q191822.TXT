TITLE   :FTP Service May Cause Deadlock in FTP and Other IIS Services
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The FTP service in the Windows NT Option Pack may cause a deadlock in the
Inetinfo process when timing out inactive users. This may cause other services,
such as the World Wide Web (w3svc) service, to become non- responsive as well.

The symptoms are otherwise non-specific. You can determine whether you are
experiencing this problem only by debugging or by testing the hotfix described
below.

CAUSE
=====

The lock is being held on a list when a completion routine for a timeout is
being called. This results in a deadlock. In the hotfix, the lock is now
released before calling the completion routine.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0
and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.
