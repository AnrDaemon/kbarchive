TITLE   :BUG: DataGrid Column Appears To Be Missing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Visible property of the left-most column in a DataGrid is set to False,
the column will not become visible after its visible property is reset to True.
This problem does not occur with other columns in the grid. If the grid has a
horizontal scroll bar, the left-most column can be scrolled to. If the grid does
not have a horizontal scroll bar, the left most column cannot be seen.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the LeftCol Property of the DataGrid to 0, after you set the Visible
Property to True.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an Jet 3.5 (Access97) database that contains a table with two fields
   in it.

2. Create a Standard EXE Project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

3. From Project/Components, select the "Microsoft ADO Data Control 6.0 (OLEDB)"
   and "Microsoft DataGrid Control 6.0 (OLEDB)."

4. Place an ADO Data Control and DataGrid on the Form.

5. Insert the following code:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
           Adodc1.ConnectionString = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.3.51; _
           Data Source=c:\mydb.mdb"
           Adodc1.RecordSource = "Select * from mytable"
           Set DataGrid1.DataSource = Adodc1

           DataGrid1.Columns(0).Visible = False
           DataGrid1.Columns(0).Visible = True
           'DataGrid1.LeftCol = 0  ' uncomment this line as workaround

         End Sub

6. Press the F5 key to run code and note that only the second column appears.
