PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2

KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smsdatabase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Systems Management Server Administrator program to cancel a
job, the job cancellation is not immediate. Any task that is currently being
processed will continue to run until it is completed. The job will not queue up
any new tasks, and the current phase will be canceled after the current task is
completed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design, and should not affect the processing of Systems Management
Server. After a job is canceled, it is recommended that the job not be deleted
for at least 48 hours, to allow the cancellation and/or any currently running
tasks to complete.

Additional query words: prodsms cancelling canceling cancelled cancelation smsadmin administrator
