TITLE   :Dirsync Administrator Does Not Receive Dirsync Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.2,3.5; winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run directory synchronization (dirsync) between a Microsoft Mail
Requestor and Microsoft Exchange Dirsync Server, the dirsync messages are not
copied to the alias specified as the Dirsync Administrator. Both automatic
dirsync and manual dirsync fail.

CAUSE
=====

The dirsync address on the General Property page of the Remote Dirsync Requestor
object is incorrect. This dirsync address represents the special mailbag on the
MS Mail postoffice that receives all dirsync messages. The dirsync address must
be a MS Mail Custom Recipient (<network name of the requestor> /
<postoffice name of the requestor> / $SYSTEM).

RESOLUTION
==========

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, select the Global Address List.
   From the View menu, choose Hidden Recipients.

2. Determine the MS Mail Custom Recipient as defined in the Cause section above.

3. On the Property Page for the MS Mail Custom Recipient, click the Advanced
   tab. In the Custom Recipient options, uncheck "Hide from address book." Close
   the Property Page.

4. Select the Remote Dirsync Requestor object in the Exchange Server
   Administrator program. Display the Property Page for the Remote Dirsync
   Requestor. On the General tab, click the Dirsync Address button. Select the
   Custom Recipient from Step 2 and click OK.

5. In the Global Address List, from the View menu, choose Hidden Recipients.

6. Display the Property Page for the MS Mail Custom Recipient from Step 2 and
   click the Advanced tab. In the "Custom recipient options", check "Hide from
   address book." Close the Property Page.

7. Run Dirsync. (Refer to Q147464, "XFOR: Manual Dirsync with Exchange Server as
   Dirsync Server," for more information.)
