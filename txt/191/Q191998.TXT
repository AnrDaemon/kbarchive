TITLE   :BUG: Form Cannot Override Parent Class AutoCenter Setting
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changing the AutoCenter property of a form based on a parent class, will not
override the AutoCenter setting of the form's parent class.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the ResetToDefault method to set the Top and Left property in the Init
method of the subclassed form, when the AutoCenter property of the Parent class
is set to .F..

For instance, put the following code in the INIT event of the form:

      This.ResetToDefault("Top")
      This.ResetToDefault("Left")

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create the parent class by issuing the following command from the Command
   window:

         CREATE CLASS Myform OF test.vcx AS Form

2. Once the Class Designer appears, change the AutoCenter property of the form
   in Class Designer to .T.. Save the class and close the Class Designer.

3. In Visual FoxPro 6.0, issue the following command from the Command window to
   create a form based on Myform:

         CREATE FORM mytestform AS myform FROM test.vcx

If you issue the preceding command in Visual FoxPro 5.x, you will get an error
because the command is not yet implemented. To do the same in Visual FoxPro 5.x,
you must set the parent class form as a form template Class. To do this, from
the Tools menu, choose Options and then click the Forms tab.

4. In the Form Designer, change the AutoCenter property from .T. to .F..

5. Save and run the form.

The form still shows up in the middle of the screen even though the AutoCenter
property is set to .F..
