SYMPTOMS
========

The Linkage 3.2 Directory Exchange (LDE) (or Exchange 5.5 Connector for PROFS or
SNADS) correlation table (CT) maintenance routine, CTCLEANUP, may fail to purge
the CT files of expired entries. The \linkage\tables\Ct2.dat and Ct2.idx files
may continue to grow to a large size. Additionally, the following may be logged
in the Linkage Administrator Log browser:

    control(760)

NOTE: This may also be an issue for the Linkage 3.2 Exchange SNADS Connector,
because CTCLEANUP is a routine common to that connector.

CAUSE
=====

Two circumstances result in this problem:

 - When the Ct2.dat file is large, a time-out on index node locking can result
   in index corruption (Ct2.idx) and return an error.

 - The CTCLEANUP routine aborts processing if any error is encountered during
   cleanup (above error), resulting in old entries remaining in the CT and file
   size growth during normal message processing.

These errors do not prevent new entries from being added to the tables; thus the
CT2 files continue to grow.

WORKAROUND
==========

Obtain the hotfix mentioned below. After obtaining the hotfix, perform the
following steps:

1. While the Linkage services are stopped, delete the file:
   \linkage\tables\Ct2.idx.


2. Replace the Ctreestd.dll and Lscms.dll components with the hotfix versions in
   the Exchsrvr\Bin directory. You may find some older versions in the
   Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn directory. Rename those older versions.

3. Restart the Linkage LDE services.

4. Reschedule the CTCLEANUP execution time, or wait for the next regularly
   scheduled time.

For information about rescheduling the CTCLEANUP routine, please review the
online "Linkage Message Exchange Help". The Help file's index includes the topic
"Change Schedule for Cleanup Process" under "Correlation Tables".

NOTE: The Ct2.idx file will be rebuilt at startup, but entries may not be purged
until 24 or more hours have elapsed. See MORE INFORMATION below. Also, after the
fix is applied, the CTCLEANUP routine will attempt to rebuild the index if an
error is detected during runtime, thus handling the corruption condition in the
future.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Linkage Message Exchange version
3.2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next service pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The correlation table is a mechanism used to track message acknowledgments from
OV/VM and SNADS. By default, the CT holds entries for seven days. If an entry is
older than seven days, CTCLEANUP purges the entry from the table. All data for
the CT is stored in the Ct2.dat file, and its index is Ct2.idx.

Connector message flow stops while CTCLEANUP is running; thus the CTCLEANUP
routine is only scheduled to run once a day by default. Even if CTCLEANUP's
schedule is modified to run more than once a day, the purge routine within
CTCLEANUP will not run if the timestamp of the zero byte file \table\CT2 (no
extension) is the current day.
