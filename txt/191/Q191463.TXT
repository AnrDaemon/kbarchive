TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Create Control Array in VB6 DHTML Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In other Visual Basic projects, you can create a control array by setting the
index of the control. However, DHTML does not support control arrays, so this
property is not exposed.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual Basic will prompt you to create a control array when adding a control of
the same name to a form. This does not occur in a DHTML Application project.
Instead, Visual Basic creates the new control with the same ID and appends a
number to the end.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a DHTML Application project in Visual Basic. DHTMLPage1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a Button to DHTMLPage1.

3. Copy and Paste the control back into DHTMLPage1. Note that you have two
   controls on the page. Note that the ID property for the second control is
   Button11. You can optionally add a third Button by pasting again. Note that
   the third Button is Button12.
