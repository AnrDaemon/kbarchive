RSERVICE Total Failures never equate to more than 1, regardless of the number of

failed, but the summary at the bottom of the log or the screen equals 1
regardless of whether there are a number of failures indicated by "Total
Failures".

version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
