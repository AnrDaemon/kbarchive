TITLE   :SMS: NULL Data Values Reported Differently by INVDOS & INVWIN32
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The data reported for common properties by INVWIN32 does not match the data
reported by INVDOS.

INVDOS reports None if there is no data for certain fields and INVWIN32 reports a
blank value if there is no data for certain fields.

There are certain properties that differ:

   Files Not Installed
   System Files Not Modified
   Failed Hardware Checks

The differing methods of reporting null data may lead to difficulties generating
queries in the Systems Management Server Administration User interface.

Queries to return all data must include both None and a space, for example:

   'None'

   -or-

   ' '

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):
