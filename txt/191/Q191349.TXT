PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Systems Management Server 1.2 does not identify the resource domain
for computers running Windows NT Server in inventory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To gather the resource information from a computer running Windows NT Server,
apply Systems Management Server version 1.2 Service Pack 4 to the site. With
Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4, inventory will now query the
Windows NT Server computer and place in inventory the resource domain in which
the Server resides. This information will appear under Network Class as a
workgroup attribute.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
