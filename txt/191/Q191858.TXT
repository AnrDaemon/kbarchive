MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a ListBox control and a CommandButton to Form1.

3. Copy the following to the Code window of Form1:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Debug.Print "Appearance property = " & List1.Appearance & _
               " Height property = " & List1.Height
            If List1.Appearance = 0 Then
               List1.Appearance = 1
            Else
               List1.Appearance = 0
            End If
         End Sub

4. Open the Immediate Window. On the Run menu, select Start, or press the F5 key
   to start the program. Click the CommandButton. Note that every CommandButton
   click causes the ListBox height to change.

   If you set the IntegralHeight property of the ListBox to False, the bug
   behavior does not occur.
