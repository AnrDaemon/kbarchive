TITLE   :BUG: Error 13 Assigning Variable to UserControl in Same Project
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive a Type Mismatch Error (13) when assigning a UserControl to a
variable if the UserControl is in the same project as the assigning code. The
problem does not occur if the UserControl is in a different project or compiled.

RESOLUTION
==========

Load the form containing the UserControl before assigning the UserControl to the
variable. (See step 8 in Steps to Reproduce Behavior below.)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a UserControl to the project.

3. Place an instance of the UserControl on Form1.

4. Add a Standard Module to the project.

5. Insert the following code into Module1:

         Sub Main()
            Dim x As UserControl1
            Set x = Form1.UserControl11
         End Sub

6. Set the Startup Object of the project to Sub Main.

7. Run the project. You should receive "Run-time error 13. Type Mismatch."

8. To resolve the problem, change the code in step 5 to:

         Sub Main()
            Dim x As UserControl1
            Load Form1
            Set x = Form1.UserControl11
         End Sub
