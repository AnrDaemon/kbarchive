Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Place the following code in a program (.prg) file and run the program:

         oForm=CREATEOBJECT("test1")
         oForm.VISIBLE=.T.
         READ EVENTS

         DEFINE CLASS test1 AS FORM
            NAME="test1"
            WHATSTHISHELP=.T.
            ADD OBJECT 'btnClose' AS COMMANDBUTTON

         PROCEDURE INIT
            THIS.btnClose.LEFT=50
            THIS.btnClose.TOP=100
            THIS.btnClose.HEIGHT=20
            THIS.btnClose.VISIBLE=.T.
         ENDPROC

         PROCEDURE btnClose.CLICK
            CLEAR EVENTS
            RELE THISFORM
         ENDPROC
         ENDDEFINE

2. When the form displays, press SHIFT+F1 to turn on WhatsThisHelp.

3. Move the mouse cursor over the title bar of the form.

Notice that the mouse cursor changes to the default pointing cursor. If you click
the title bar, WhatsThisHelp still functions. In Visual FoxPro 3.0, clicking the
title bar invokes the Microsoft Visual FoxPro Help. In Visual FoxPro 5.0, a tool
tip box appears with the following:
