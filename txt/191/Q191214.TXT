KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbCompiler kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you compile a project, Visual Basic raises a warning dialog box about
Binary Compatibility being broken if there has been a change in an interface.
The dialog box gives the choice to accept the changes (and break compatibility
with older versions) or to cancel the compile (and ensure that compatibility is
kept).

When canceling the compile to keep Binary Compatibility, the following error
message may appear:

   Object library invalid or contains references to object definitions that
   could not be found.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is an erroneous message and can be ignored.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
