DOCUMENT:Q191954  20-AUG-1999  [foxpro]
TITLE   :PRB: OLE DLL with Exposed Objects Returns Incorrect Description
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, an OLE .dll with two exposed objects can return the
wrong class description in an error message.

CAUSE
=====

The error routine for a User Interface error in a Visual FoxPro .dll always
takes the class description from the first class.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new project called OLETest1.

2. Place the following code into a program file called Test1.prg:

         DEFINE CLASS ErrTest1 AS CUSTOM OLEPUBLIC

            NAME="ErrTest1"
            PROCEDURE gettime
               5 &&Put here to generate an error
               RETURN TIME()
            ENDPROC
         ENDDEFINE

         DEFINE CLASS ErrTest2 AS CUSTOM OLEPUBLIC
            NAME="ErrTest2"
            PROCEDURE gettime
               5 &&Put here to generate an error
               RETURN TIME()
            ENDPROC
         ENDDEFINE

3. Build this into an OLE .dll named OLETest1.

4. Run the following code in the Command window:

         oTmp5=CREATEOBJECT("OLETest1.ErrTest1")
         oTmp6=CREATEOBJECT("OLETest1.ErrTest2")
         *  ?oTmp5.gettime() && Uncomment to show correct error.
         ?oTmp6.gettime()

This produces the following error:

   OLE IDispatch Exception Code 1031 from OLETest1.ErrTest1 ErrTest1:
   ErrTest2.gettime e:\mytest\test1.prg Error Line 13 User Interface operation
   not allowed at this time. 1031

To see the error message referencing the correct class description, uncomment the
third line of the code in step 4 and comment the fourth line.
