OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Automatic backup of a WINS database does not occur every three hours as stated
in the documentation. It occurs every 24 to 27 hours.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WINS backup will occur 24 to 27 hours after the last backup occurred.
Additionally, the backup will happen later each day because the next backup-
time will be calculated when the current backup has finished.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, create a small batch file to stop and start the WINS
service, and schedule this batch to run at a certain time of day. Additionally,
configure WINS to make a backup of the database on exit.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
