TITLE   :PRB: SEEK Returns Different Results Depending on No. of Fields
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SEEK command returns different results depending on the number of fields in
a table. If there are 62 or less fields in a table, the SEEK command returns
false when another user unmarks a record that has been marked for deletion . If
there are 63 or more fields in the table, the SEEK command returns true. The
expected result would be that SEEK would return false. Make sure that the SET
REFRESH is set to zero and that SET DELETED is on.

CAUSE
=====

This seems to occur because FoxPro reads the table from the hard drive and
retrieves the data if there are more than 62 fields in the table. If there are
62 fields or less, then FoxPro reads the data from the cache.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The preceding scenario depends on having two sessions of FoxPro open and marking
a record for deletion in a table in the first session, then opening the same
table in a second session. After switching back to the first session and
recalling the record, the SEEK command returns false if there are 62 or less
fields in the table or it returns true if there are 63 or more fields in the
table. The SET REFRESH must be set to zero and SET DELETED ON, for this to
occur.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open two sessions of FoxPro. Issue the SET REFRESH TO 0,0 command in both of
   the sessions.

2. Open a table, shared, that contains 62 or less fields in the first session of
   FoxPro. Mark the first record for deletion and move the cursor off the
   record.

3. Switch to the second session of FoxPro and issue a SET DELETED ON. Open the
   same table, shared, and set the order to one of the fields that has an index.

4. Switch back to the first session of FoxPro and unmark the deletion from the
   first record and move the cursor off the record.

5. Switch back to the second session and issue the following command, giving the
   SEEK command the value of the field that is indexed in the first record that
   you unmarked for deletion the first FoxPro session:

         WAIT WINDOW IIF(SEEK("<value>"), ".T.", ".F.")

   NOTE: The SEEK command returns false.

6. Follow steps 2-5 using a table with 63 or more fields. Note that the SEEK
   command now returns true.
