   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Terminal Server Administration utility from the
Start/Programs/Administrative Tools menu, a Dr. Watson Access Violation error in
Tsadmin.exe is generated.

Example: (text from Drwatson.log file)

   Application exception occurred:
   App: exe\tsadmin.dbg
   When: 8/3/1998 @ 9:35:15.733
   Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

CAUSE
=====

The registry setting for the InstallDate was set to 0 (zero).

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem can be resolved by editing the registry and changing the value for
the InstallDate to a valid value.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To correctly configure the InstallDate, use the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) to
edit the following registry key:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and locate the following registry subkey
   in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree:

   \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\InstallDate

2. Select the InstallDate value and change it to a valid Hex Dword, representing
   an appropriate date and time, for example:

    - Sunday, January 01, 1995, 12:00:00 AM = 2f0636d0

    - Monday, January 01, 1996, 12:00:00 AM = 30e76a50

3. Use the registry entry value from another computer.

4. Write a small C program using ctime to calculate the exact value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The installation of hotfixes on Terminal Server can also cause the Dr. Watson
error because of the missing value of Installed On. Tsadmin.exe enumerates the
Hotfix key to get the information regarding hotfixes installed on the system.
The absence of the Installed On value can cause Dr. Watson errors, too.

Check the following information in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Hotfix\<Q
   Article Number>
   Add Value: Installed On
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Data: 0x0

Additional query words: installdate tsadmin
