TITLE   :Upgrading Host Security Files May Cause Corrupted Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Upgrading SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 1 Host Security files (from the HOSTSEC
directory) may cause corruption to the Host Account Database (DBase.dbs). When
the database becomes corrupted, it may prevent users from using the Single
Sign-On (SSO) feature, also known as automatic logon. Other symptoms may be that
the Host Account Cache service (SNADATABASE) stops responding to RPC requests.

The application log of the event viewer shows the following two events coming
from source SNA Host Security, after SP1 is upgraded.

   Event ID 1247 - Unable to decrypt data Supplied code 0x80090005

   Event ID 1283 - Database has been corrupted - contact system support
   Supplied code 0x1

CAUSE
=====

The cause is not currently known but is under investigation.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can remove and reinstall the Host Security
components. Because a removal is required, the Host Security Database must be
repopulated again, either by using the Host Account Manager (UDConfig.exe) or by
using the command-line utility SNACFG.
