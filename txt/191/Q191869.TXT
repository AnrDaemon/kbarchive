TITLE   :BUG: RELEASE MENUS _MSYSMENU Releases System Menu
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing a RELEASE MENUS _MSYSMENU command with only the Visual FoxPro system
menu active causes the Sysmenu menu to disappear.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Help file indicates that the RELEASE MENUS should release user defined menus
and not the System menu.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Command window, issue the following command:

         RELEASE MENUS _MSYSMENU

2. After pressing the ENTER key, notice that the System menu disappears. In
   Visual FoxPro 5.x and 6.0, a small rectangular box appears in the upper
   left-hand corner of the Visual FoxPro desktop. If you invoke the Task Bar by
   pressing the ALT+TAB keys, you see that two Visual FoxPro icons appear.
   Clicking the bottom of the box produces a "Menu manager internal consistency
   error" dialog box. After clicking OK, Visual FoxPro causes an access
   violation error.

   In Visual FoxPro 3.x, the system menu disappears without any small box and any
   errors.

3. Quit Visual FoxPro and restart to restore the System menu.
