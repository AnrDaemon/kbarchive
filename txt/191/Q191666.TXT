-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Terminal Server responds with the following blue screen STOP error:

   STOP 0x00000050 Page_Fault_in_Non-Paged_Area

 - For the 5P/MP, revert to using the driver that comes with Terminal Server,
   not the one from the installation diskette.
