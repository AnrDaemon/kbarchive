TITLE   :BUG: Controls Do Not Refresh After Exit From Screen Saver on NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbScreenSaver kbVBp kbVBp500bug kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Controls on a form whose ClipControls property is set to False may not refresh
properly after the Screen Saver is activated and then deactivated. When the
mouse is moved to dismiss the Screen Saver, the form reappears but some controls
are not redrawn properly. For example, Textbox controls do not retain their 3-D
appearance. Programmatically refresh the form to cause the controls to be drawn
properly.

This problem only occurs on Windows NT 4.0. The problem does not occur on Windows
95, Windows 98, Windows Me, or Windows 2000.


RESOLUTION
==========

Set the ClipControls property of the form to True (the default value).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On Windows NT 4.0 Display Properties, enable the "Blank Screen" Screen Saver
   and set Wait to one minute.

2. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

3. Set the ClipControls property of Form1 to False.

4. Add a Textbox control to Form1.

5. Run the project and wait one minute for the Screen Saver to activate.

6. Move the mouse to dismiss the screen saver. Notice the textbox has a flat
   (2-D appearance) instead of a 3-D appearance.
