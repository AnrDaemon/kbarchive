TITLE   :SMS: SMS SQL View Generator Not Completely Silent in Unattended
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsmsUtil smsutil

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the SMS SQL View Generator (Smsview.exe), you can create database views on
the Systems Management Server database. The SMS SQL View Generator creates views
for all personal computer groups that exist in the database at the time it is
run.

The Systems Management Server Books Online describes that utility as follows:

   From the SMS\SITE.SRV\platform directory, you can run the SMS SQL
   View Generator from the command line using the following syntax:

      smsview <options>

Options are any of the following:

      /s:<servername>
         Specifies the name of the computer running the instance of SQL
         Server containing the database.

      /l:<loginname>
         Specifies a login ID on SQL Server that has database owner (dbo)
         permissions on the database.

      /p:<password>
         Specifies the password for the login ID you specified with the
         /l:<loginname> option.

      /d:<database>
         Specifies the name of the site database.

For example:

   smsview /s:smsdbsrv /l:smsdbo /p:alpha /d:sms

The command line allows you to use the SMS SQL View Generator in a batch file or
other scheduled process. No messages are displayed on the console. When the SMS
SQL View Generator is run as a command, success or failure of the command is
logged to the application log of the Windows NT event log. If the SMS SQL View
Generator fails, the event provides a brief explanation of the cause (for
example, if one of the command line arguments is invalid). All SMS SQL View
Generator events have a source of SMS View.

Note that the documentation states:

   No messages are displayed on the console.

However, when the SMSVIEW executable is run from a command line, a dialog box is
displayed stating that the Views were successfully created.

The documentation also states:

   When the SMS SQL View Generator is run as a command, success or failure
   of the command is logged to the application log of the Windows NT event
   log. If the SMS SQL View Generator fails, the event provides a brief
   explanation of the cause (for example, if one of the command line
   arguments is invalid). All SMS SQL View Generator events have a source
   of SMS View.

This is also incorrect. It does not log any information in the Windows NT event
log.
