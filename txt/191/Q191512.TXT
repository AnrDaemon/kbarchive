TITLE   :PRB: DataFormat Property Not Reset to Blank Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the properties window, the DataFormat property of a text box control is set
to nothing ("") by default. Once the user sets it to some other value, such as
DATE, it cannot be reset back to nothing ("") by deleting the DATE value
therein.

RESOLUTION
==========

To reset this property the value needs to be set to GENERAL, which is the same
as the default setting [ASCII 150] nothing ("").

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 6.0 and create a Standard EXE project.

2. Place a text box control on the new form.

3. In the Properties dialog box, note that the DataFormat property is currently
   blank. Set the DataFormat property to DATE.

4. Go back to the Properties dialog box and try to delete DATE. Note that it
   cannot be deleted.

NOTE: To go back to the original default state, reset the DataFormat to GENERAL.
This time GENERAL displays in the Properties dialog box. It is not possible at
this point to clear the contents of this property.
