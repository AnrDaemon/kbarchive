TITLE   :BUG: ON ERROR Does Not Trap "Alias Not Found" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual FoxPro's ON ERROR command does not trap the following error:

   Alias not found error (error 13).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Create a program that contains the following code and run the program:

      SET SAFETY OFF
      ON ERROR WAIT WINDOW ("FIRST ON ERROR: " + CHR(13) + MESSAGE())
      CREATE DATABASE Ztest
      CREATE TABLE Ztest (FirstName C(20), LastName C(20))
      USE Ztest EXCLUSIVE
      INDEX ON LEFT(Ztest.FirstName,6) TAG FIRST6 OF Ztest && Comment this
                                                           && line.
      SELECT Ztest
      USE
      SET SAFETY OFF
      ON ERROR WAIT WINDOW ("Second ON ERROR: " + CHR(13) + MESSAGE())
      USE Ztest  ALIAS CLOSE_Ztest
      SET ORDER TO TAG FIRST6
      USE
      ON ERROR
      *  Clean up and delete files.
      CLOSE ALL
      DELETE FILE Ztest.DBC
      DELETE FILE Ztest.dcx
      DELETE FILE Ztest.dct
      DELETE FILE Ztest.DBF

Run the program and note that the ON ERROR routine traps the following error:

   Variable 'First6' not found.

Next, place an asterisk (*) in front of the INDEX ON command in the code. Run the
code again and note that the ON ERROR command does not trap the "Alias not
found" error. In addition, the ON ERROR command does not trap error 13 when
evoked from the Command window either.
