TITLE   :Dr. Watson Error When Adding New Printer on Spanish Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An access violation occurs when adding any new printer with the Printers folder
in Control Panel, or with the Add Printer Wizard. This will occur on the Spanish
version of Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 with Internet Explorer 4 installed.

CAUSE
=====

When adding any new printer and the path from which Windows NT originally
installs is not available, Windows prompts the user to insert the Windows NT
compact disc. Because of a localization problem in Setupapi.dll installed by
Internet Explorer 4, Explorer.exe will fail when prompting for the Windows NT
compact disc.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, make sure the Windows NT installation files are
available (the compact disc is in the drive) before adding a new printer.
