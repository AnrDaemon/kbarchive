TITLE   :PRB: Report Command Used In Visual FoxPro COM DLL Causes Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running the Report command within an in-process OLE component created in
Microsoft Visual FoxPro 6.0, returns an error indicating that the User-
Interface operation is not allowed at this time.

CAUSE
=====

The Report command calls the User Interface functions in order to properly run
the report. User Interface functions are no longer allowed in in- process
Component Object Model (COM) servers created in Microsoft Visual FoxPro.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a Local COM server (.exe) in Visual FoxPro that can be called by the
in-process server to run the report, or build the original object as a Local COM
server (.exe).

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The full text of the error message returned that follows, uses the file, class
and procedure name used in the Steps to Reproduce Behavior section of this
article. The path specified in the error message will also vary depending on the
file location.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Place the following code in a program file named DllMain.prg in a new project
   and build it as a COM DLL named MyServer.dll. Select Ignore when you build
   the .dll if the Project Manager reports that it can not find the report named
   rpt1.

         DEFINE CLASS MyClass AS CUSTOM OLEPUBLIC
            MyName="MyClass"
            PROCEDURE runit
               REPORT FORM rpt1 TO PRINTER NOCONSOLE NOWAIT
            ENDPROC
         ENDDEFINE

2. Place the following code in a new program file named CallIt.prg:

         oX=CREATEOBJECT("MyServer.MyClass")
         oX.RunIt
         RELEASE oX

3. Run the CallIt program.
