KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The output from the TYPE command does not contain line numbers when using the
NUMBER, AUTO, and WRAP options.

CAUSE
=====

When combining the AUTO, WRAP, and NUMBER options the lines beginning with
spaces are not parsed correctly. Therefore, some line numbers are omitted.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the spaces from the beginning of any lines in the text file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a text file named Ztest.txt that contains the following data. When
   adding the second line, press the space bar several times to add a few spaces
   before typing the data.

   Test line 1
   Test Line 2
   Test Line 3
   Test Line 4

2. Close the text file and type the following line in the Command window:

   " TYPE Ztest.txt NUMBER AUTO WRAP" (without the quotation marks)

   Notice that the second line does not have a line number preceding it.

3. If you type the following, you get the proper line numbers:

   " TYPE Ztest.txt NUMBER AUTO" (without the quotation marks)
