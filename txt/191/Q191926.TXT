Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a data source on the Tastrade database.

2. In a product, like MSQuery, create and run the following query:

   Select * from Orders
            where Order_Date between {d '1997-01-01'} and {d '2000-01-01'}

This query fails to return records that match the criteria.

Depending on the version of TasTrade being used, the OrderDate field name could
differ. Please check this and change the name in the SQL statement as necessary.
