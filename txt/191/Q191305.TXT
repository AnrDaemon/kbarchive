TITLE   :SMS: Hierarchy Manager Can Ignore the Site Attachment Dump
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbHMan smshierman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To avoid the cost of doing a database dump when attaching a child primary site
to a parent site, Hierarchy Manager can now ignore the dump creation command,
based on a registry setting. This way, if your site has a large number of
computers, you can set the registry entry and attach to a parent site, and you
do not need to waste the time doing the dump.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Systems Management Server Hierarchy Manager has been modified to look for a
new DWORD registry value in its component registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Components
   \SMS_HIERARCHY_MANAGER

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

The new entry is "Dont Send DB To Parent Site". If this entry exists, and its
DWORD value is set to "1", Systems Management Server does not do a database dump
to the parent on site attachment. Also, some extra logging has been added, so
that Systems Management Server can tell whether or not a database dump has been
instigated.
