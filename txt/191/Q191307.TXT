TITLE   :SMS: Despooler Can't Create Temp Storage While Decompressing Pkg
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDespooler smsdespooler

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The despooler cannot decompress the package when a drive letter is specified in
the registry under the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_Despooler
   \Preferred Drive For Temp Directory

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

If a drive letter is specified in that registry location, entries similar to the
following will appear in the Despoolr.log file:

      use drive $ for all temp files
      $ drive has the most free space, we'll use it for temp storage
      ...
      Cannot create temp storage $:\ while decompressing package.
      Win32 error = 3

   The Win32 error = 3 is 'The system cannot find the path specified'.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, leave the registry key mentioned above blank (this
is the default setting).

STATUS
======

version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
