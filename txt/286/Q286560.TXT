======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are executing a query against the DB2OLEDB drive, you may experience an
error message similar to this:

      Interface: Unknown
      Result: 0x80004005 = E_FAIL

This error will occur if you are trying to retrieve a DB2 data column that is
more than 300 bytes in length, with the host character code set identifier
(CCSID) set to "290". The ODBC driver would work fine.

CAUSE
=====

SNANLS.dll, which handles converting single-byte character stream (SBCS)
EBCDIC-to-Unicode-to-ANSI and SBCS ANSI-to-Unicode-to-EBCDIC, was overrunning a
static buffer.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this
