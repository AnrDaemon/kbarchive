TITLE   :OLMAC: Error Message:  Exceeded the Maximum Amount of Text
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::8.2,8.2.1,8.2.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, versions 8.2, 8.2.1, 8.2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to read messages by using Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server
edition, you may receive the following error message:

   The item could not be displayed. You have exceeded the maximum amount of text

You may also experience one of the following symptoms:

 - Messages from personal computer users result in the preceding error message.

 - Your system stops responding when you try to display your calendar (schedule)
   in Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server edition.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of a damaged font or because too many fonts are
installed on your system.

This behavior has been observed and reproduced when too many fonts were present
on an Apple Macintosh system. The exact number of fonts that your system can
handle can vary with the amount of random access memory (RAM) that you have and
with the available resources on your system.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, either replace your installed fonts or reduce the
number of active fonts in Adobe Type Manager Deluxe. To do this:

 - Temporarily disable any font utilities that can cause a font conflict. To
   disable the font utilities, turn off the font smoothing feature in the
   Appearance Control Panel, turn off both Adobe Type Manager and Adobe Type
   Reunion, and turn off any other utility that can affect the font appearance.

 - Move all fonts (except for the Chicago, Charcoal, Geneva, and Monaco system
   fonts) to a folder on your desktop. Add back fonts individually or in small
   groups to identify the offending font and to verify the number of active
   fonts that your system enables.
