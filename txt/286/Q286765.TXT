SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 (DB2OLEDB) and Microsoft ODBC Driver for
DB2 that ship with Host Integration Server 2000, do not support two-phase commit
(2PC) distributed transactions over a TCP/IP network connection. Distributed
transactions are only supported when connecting to DB2 by way of SNA LU 6.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DTC-Driven 2PC Support for DB2 for OS/390 and AS/400 Using LU 6.2:

In Host Integration Server 2000, the OLE DB Provider for DB2 and ODBC Driver for
DB2 are enhanced to support the DRDA Two-Phase Commit protocols over LU 6.2.
This enables COM+ applications to participate in a Distributed Transaction
Coordinator (DTC)-driven, two-phase commit transaction between SQL Server and
DB2 databases on OS/390 and OS/400. Distributed transactions across an SNA LU
6.2 network to DB2 UDB for AIX and DB2 UDB for Windows NT are not supported.

Distributed transactions are a new feature of Microsoft Host Integration Server
2000. The provider and driver that ship with SNA Server 4.0 do not have this
feature.

Working with Microsoft Transaction Server:

Because Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) uses DTC, DB2OLEDB and the Microsoft
ODBC Driver for DB2 cannot be used under MTS transaction when TCP/IP
connectivity is used. DB2OLEDB and the Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2 can be used
under MTS transaction when SNA LU 6.2 connectivity is used.
