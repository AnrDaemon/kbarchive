======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Although a package is delivered to client computers and inventory collection is
enabled, Software Inventory information is not updated on the SMS database. In
the Maintman.log file on the site server, which is located in \SMS\logs\ folder,
may have the following error message logged:

   ERROR in Package rule file: syntax error Line: 1~~

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because when an SMS 1.2 client logs on to the domain, it
checks the Pkg_16.cfg file in the \SMS\Logon.srv file. If Pkg_16.cfg is a zero
byte file, the client does not have the necessary information regarding what to
collect for the software inventory. This behavior can occur when the Package.rul
file, that is located in \SMS\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Pkgrule folder contains a
negative CHECKSUM value.

For example,

   PACKAGE 58 "Captura Submitter 4.09" FILE "submit4.EXE" DATE 12/28/00 BYTE 0
   77 CHECKSUM 0 0 -1830212815
   PACKAGE 59 "Captura v4.09M (Build 827) Full" FILE "captura4.EXE" DATE 01/04/01
   BYTE 0 77 CHECKSUM 0 0 -1742860494

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, you have to eliminate the negative CHECKSUM value.
To do so, use either of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

1. Open Package.rul in \SMS\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Pkgrule\ by using Notepad.exe.

2. Delete the lines that have a negative CHECKSUM value.

3. Stop, and then restart SMS_Maintenance_Manager. To do this, go in the SMS
   Administrator Program, and then on the Tool menu, click SMS Service Manager.

4. Verify that the Pkg_16.cfg file is not a zero byte file.

Method 2
--------

To delete the package that is causing the zero byte Pkg_16.cfg file:

1. In the SMS Administrator console, click the Package icon, and then locate the
   package.

2. Create a Remove Package from Server job.

3. After the job deletes packages from distribution servers, delete the package.

4. Stop and then restart SMS_Maintenance_Manager.

5. Verify that the Pkg_16.cfg file is not a zero byte file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Application Manager monitors the SMS database for new or changed inventory
packages and creates a file that is called an inventory rule file (Package.rul).
This file contains all of the defined inventory packages.

Maintenance Manager copies a binary version of the inventory rule file
(Package.rul) to all logon servers at the site.

When you create a package, the file name, byte size, and CHECKSUM size can be
added or retrieved. In some circumstances, a negative CHECKSUM value has been
added even if the CHECKSUM field does not allow a negative value entry. If this
is the case, the contents of Package.rul are created with a negative CHECKSUM
value.
