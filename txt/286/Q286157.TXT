======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Host print jobs may print an extra blank page at the beginning of the print job
after you apply SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) or SP4. In addition, the
same symptoms may occur when you upgrade from SNA Server 4.0 SP2 or earlier to
Host Integration Server 2000.

The blank page is printed when the host print job includes a Form Feed (0x0C) at
the beginning of the print job, even though the FEEDIGNOREINITIAL option is
configured for the LU3 print session.

The problem does not occur with SNA Server 3.0 SP4, SNA Server 4.0 SP1, or SNA
Server 4.0 SP2 when you print the same LU3 print job when the FEEDIGNOREINITIAL
option is configured.

Note This problem can occur with both LU1 and LU3 print jobs.

CAUSE
=====

The FEEDIGNOREINITIAL parameter is not checked because of a change that was made
to the host print service in SNA Server 4.0 SP3.
