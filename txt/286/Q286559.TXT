TITLE   :XFOR:"No Mapping Between Account Names & Security IDs Was Done"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5, on platform(s):
    - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On servers that are running any of the following products

1. Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes

2. Microsoft Exchange Connector for IBM OfficeVision/VM (PROFS)

3. Microsoft Exchange Connector for SNADS

the following event ID may be logged in the Application log each time that you
start the Connectivity Controller:

   Event ID: 2014
   Source: MSExchangeCoCo
   Type: Error
   Category: Controller

   Description:
   "{WIN32:1332(No mapping between account names and security IDs was done.)}:
   Could not determine SID for Administrators"

CAUSE
=====

This issue may occur due to an incorrect setting of the Exchconn.ini file. The
error is logged if there is an invalid account that is specified for the
parameter "rcsaccess".

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

 - Navigate to the \Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn folder to create a backup of the
   Exchconn.ini file.

 - Open the Exchconn.ini in Notepad.

 - Locate the line that starts with the following parameter:

   rcsaccess =

 - Remove any invalid network accounts, and then empty Groups. Make sure that
   you specified the Administrators group and that all entries after the
   parameter "rcsaccess = " are separated by commas.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can safely ignore the error message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is no non-English installer for the Exchange Notes Connector on Exchange
Service Pack CDs, so you have to use the English installer Ntsconn.exe from the
\Exchconn\Setup\i386\Ntsconn\ folder. This installer creates an Exchconn.ini
with the line "rcsaccess = Administrators". On non-English systems the name of
the Administrators group may be localized, so that the Administrators group does
not exist. This causes the Connectivity Controller to log the event 2014 during
startup.
