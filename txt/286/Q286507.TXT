TITLE   :XGEN: CDO Returns Substring Search Instead of Prefix
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) message filter objects to generate
a result set, if you filter by one of the nine documented message properties in
the following rule, an incorrect result record set may be returned. The results
should be returned by using the following documented rule from the Microsoft
Developer Network (MSDN):

   For fields of data type other than String, the MAPI search restriction type
   is RES_PROPERTY with relational operator RELOP_EQ. For fields of data type
   String, the restriction type is RES_CONTENT with fuzzy level options
   FL_SUBSTRING, FL_IGNORECASE, and FL_LOOSE. However, the following MAPI
   properties are compared using FL_PREFIX instead of FL_SUBSTRING:

 - PR_ACCOUNT

 - PR_BUSINESS_ADDRESS_CITY

 - PR_COMPANY_NAME

 - PR_DEPARTMENT_NAME

 - PR_DISPLAY_NAME

 - PR_GIVEN_NAME

 - PR_OFFICE_LOCATION

 - PR_SURNAME

 - PR_TITLE

However, the result set is comprised of a SUBSTRING search rather than the
PREFIX, for example:

   FilterFields.Add CdoPR_SURNAME, "M"

This builds a filter with all of the last names that contain the letter "M",
rather than those that begin with the letter "M".
