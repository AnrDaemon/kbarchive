TITLE   :UNCAuthenticationPassThrough Support Limitation in IIS 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you consult a page that is physically located on a remote virtual
directory, the UNCAuthenticationPassthrough metabase property allows Internet
Information Server 5.0 to access remote files using client (browser)
credentials. However, this option is not currently supported, although this
feature is documented in the IIS Resource Guide.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This feature has not been extensively tested by the IIS team with the current
version of this product. This scenario also increases the number of server
message block (SMB) sessions between the redirector on IIS servers and the
remote SMB server, and requires more resources on the SMB servers.

Even if you do not use the UNCAuthenticationPassthrough feature, Microsoft
recommends that you replicate contents locally to the IIS server rather than
access file resources on network servers. This approach enables your Web sites
to scale up and down, and to avoid access to the centralized file server (which
may become a performance bottleneck). The Site Server Content Replication
Service may help you to set up your replication environment.
