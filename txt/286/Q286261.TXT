TITLE   :Duplicate Messages Received by a Public Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange550preSP5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If mail is sent to a distribution list, and some of the members of that
distribution list have a public folder as an alternate recipient, the public
folder receives duplicate mails for each member of the distribution list who has
a public folder as an alternate recipient, instead of receiving only one mail.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the information store incorrectly allocates a new
Internet message ID for messages that are sent to public folders. In the
scenario in the "Symptoms" section of this article, the information store treats
the messages that are sent to the distribution list and the public folder as
separate; therefore, multiple messages are seen in the public folders, instead
of one.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
