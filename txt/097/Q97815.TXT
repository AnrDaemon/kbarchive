======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The Lexmark 4033 LAN Connection for Printers Model 1 does not work with LAN
Manager 2.1 running on an IBM LAN server.

It needs IBM Data Link Control (DLC) from OS/2 Extended Edition. The LAN Manager
DLC (comtokr or the nokia software from Comm Server) does not work, probably due
to some proprietary hooks in the 4033 redirection code.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 2.10a 2.20
