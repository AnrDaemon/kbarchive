The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word for Windows and Bookshelf, Multimedia Edition, versions 2.0a-CD, 2.0c-CD

SUMMARY
=======

When trying to install the Word for Windows and Bookshelf integration from a
networked CD-ROM, you may receive the following error message:

   Unable to Update WWORD20.INF. If your disk is write-protected, remove the
   protection from the disk.

This error will cause Word for Windows setup to fail. Word for Windows with
Bookshelf integration can only be installed from a local CD-ROM drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Word for Windows Setup cannot run across a network CD-ROM drive. The Setup
program does not recognize that it is being installed from a read-only device.
Word Setup will ask for the customer and company name and then try to write this
information to the WWORD20.INF file. Because the CD-ROM is read-only, this file
cannot be changed; therefore, the error occurs.
