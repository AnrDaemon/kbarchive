SUMMARY
=======

The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia entry on Trigonometry contains a graphic that
is missing the right-hand border.

If you copy the graphic to the Windows clipboard, the right-hand border is still
missing. However, the border does appear correctly in Bit Edit.

This problem is corrected in Bookshelf 1993.
