TITLE   :Framing Difference Prevents Comms from NetWare to ArcNet
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

In a mixed LAN Manager/NetWare environment, LAN Manager's NDIS drivers use 802
framing for what goes out through the ArcNet card, and Novell NetWare uses
ArcNet framing. The framing difference prevents communication, unless you are
using a monolithic stack for an ArcNet driver under LAN Manager. Otherwise, you
cannot talk to NetWare on ArcNet.

The same condition exists in Windows for Workgroups 3.1.
