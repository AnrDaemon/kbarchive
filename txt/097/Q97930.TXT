SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Norton Antivirus version 2.0, you may receive the following
error message:

   NAV WARNING: Insufficient memory to scan file. Access denied.

This error message may be displayed just after SMARTDRV.EXE is loaded and usually
occurs only if you are loading SMARTDRV.EXE high.

NOTE: Even if you receive the above error message, all your device drivers and
programs load normally. No functionality is lost.

CAUSE
=====

The error is caused by the file NAV&.SYS.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Load NAV&.SYS before EMM386.EXE and any other upper memory block (UMB)
   providers, or make sure that you are loading it into a UMB that has at least
   64 kilobytes (K) free.

 - Contact Symantec and obtain an updated version of Norton Antivirus version
   2.0. Versions of Norton Antivirus released on or after June 4, 1992, do not
   exhibit this problem.
