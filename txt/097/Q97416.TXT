TITLE   :MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup May Delete CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the /M parameter when you install MS-DOS 6 Upgrade onto a machine
running Stacker (manufactured by STAC Electronics) or SuperStor (manufactured by
AddStor, Inc.), your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files may be deleted from the
host and compressed drives. As a result, when you restart your computer, the
disk-compression software does not load and compressed data is not available.


If the files are deleted, the following error message appears twice during
Setup:

   Error reading file

In addition, you may be left with AUTOEXEC.NEW and CONFIG.NEW files in the root
directory of the boot drive.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, restore your original files with the following
steps:

1. Restart your computer with the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup Disk 1 in drive A.

2. When "Starting MS-DOS..." is displayed, press the F5 function key.

3. Remove Setup Disk 1 from drive A and insert Setup Disk 3.

4. Run Undelete by typing "undelete c:" (without the quotation marks) at the
   MS-DOS command prompt and then pressing ENTER.

5. When you are given the option to undelete your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
   files, press Y.

6. Restart your computer.

7. When Stacker loads and prompts you with the following message, press Y:

   Would you like Stacker to update the file(s)?

   If you have the AUTOEXEC.NEW and CONFIG.NEW files in the root directory of
   your boot drive, you can rename these files as AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS.
   To do this, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt, pressing ENTER
   after each line:

   " ren autoexec.new autoexec.bat
   ren config.new config.sys" (without the quotation marks)
