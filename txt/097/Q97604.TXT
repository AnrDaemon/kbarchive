SUMMARY
=======

If your boot drive (usually drive C) cannot be written to until a device driver
is loaded, MemMaker cannot function properly. To work around this problem,
perform the following steps:

1. Use the SYS command to create an MS-DOS startup (boot) floppy disk. For
   example, from the MS-DOS command prompt, type "SYS C: A:" (without the
   quotation marks) and press ENTER.

2. Copy MEMMAKER.EXE, CHKSTATE.SYS, HIMEM.SYS, EMM386.EXE, and SIZER.EXE to the
   startup floppy disk in drive A.

3. Copy your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to the floppy disk in drive A and
   modify them as appropriate to cause them to restart the system properly. For
   example, if you have a device statement such as "device=drv.sys", modify the
   statement to explicitly look at drive C ("device=c:\drv.sys").

4. With the floppy disk in drive A, restart computer.

5. From the MS-DOS command prompt on drive A, type "MEMMAKER" (without the
   quotation marks) and press ENTER.

6. When MemMaker is finished, copy the modified CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
   files to drive C.

7. Using MS-DOS Editor, edit the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT file to ensure the
   path statements for HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE point to the hard drive. For
   example, make sure the device statement for HIMEM.SYS is
   DEVICE\C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS, and not DEVICE=A:\HIMEM.SYS.
