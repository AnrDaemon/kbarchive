SUMMARY
=======

If you are printing a report on both an Apple ImageWriter and a LaserWriter and
are using any version of the Apple System software, including System versions
7.0 and later, you must create two different reports.

To create the reports:

1. Select the LaserWriter printer through the Chooser, and create a report.

2. Save the report.

3. Use the Save As command to save a copy of the report with a name appropriate
   to the ImageWriter.

4. Use the Chooser to select the ImageWriter printer. Reformat the report as
   required.

Another option is to create a report for the ImageWriter and print it on the
LaserWriter at 96 percent, but this method is not always feasible.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs because FoxBASE+/Mac uses Apple's printer drivers. Apple's
printers expect a header file (which FoxBASE+/Mac prepares with the creation of
a report) to be sent along with any text sent to the printer. The format of this
header file has changed since the evolution of the LaserWriter.

Therefore, if an ImageWriter receives a header file prepared for the LaserWriter,
it will not automatically use the default printer settings. The same is true for
sending an ImageWriter header file to the LaserWriter.
