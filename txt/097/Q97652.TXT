-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Novell Message Handling Service (MHS) has three message priority levels, which
the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS maps as logically as possible to its own
priority levels.

Here are the priorities and what they are mapped to:

MS-DOS Client
-------------

   1 - Low
   2 - Medium
   3 - Medium
   4 - Medium
   5 - High
   R - High

Windows Client
--------------

   Low - Low
   Normal - Medium
   High - High

Messages with return receipts are classified as high priority, even though within
Microsoft Mail a return receipt does not affect priority.

NOTE: There may be interoperability problems when some other systems map
priorities to MHS. Messages received with unknown priority are mapped to the
medium priority.
