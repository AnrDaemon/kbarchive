Include/Exclude Fails When Using a Default Setup File
-----------------------------------------------------

If you try to include or exclude a file or directory when you use Microsoft
Backup, the actual files backed up may not match what you expect. For example,
to back up your MS-DOS directory (usually c:\DOS) but exclude the *.EXE files,
you would include C:\DOS\*.* and then exclude all the C:\DOS\*.EXE files;
however, if you do so, all files in the MS-DOS directory may still be included
in the backup.

If you select a directory from which you have excluded files, you either select
or clear all the files in that directory; any inclusions and exclusions are no
longer active. If you want to include or exclude a file in a directory after you
have selected or cleared the directory's files, hold the SHIFT key and select
(or clear) the file.

Includes and excludes are performed in the order that you specify; therefore, if
you exclude the *.EXE files first and then include the entire directory,
Microsoft Backup includes the entire directory.

This situation also occurs when your default backup configuration overrides your
manual excludes.

To correct this situation, do the following:

1. Run Microsoft Backup and choose the Backup button.

2. In the Backup From box, select the drive to back up from. Select the drive
   icon again so that there is no text (such as Some Files or All Files) beside
   it. Note: You can select the drive icon by double-clicking or pressing
   SPACEBAR.

3. Choose the Select Files button and then use one of the following methods to
   include and exclude files:

    - Use the mouse pointer

    - Select a file and press SPACEBAR

    - Use the Include or Exclude dialog boxes
