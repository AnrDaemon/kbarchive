KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The interactive boot option included with MS-DOS 6.0 (the F8 key) works with the
CONFIG.SYS file only; it does not work with the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Stepping
through a batch file using the interactive boot option is not a feature of
MS-DOS 6.0. You can, however, use the CHOICE and IF ERRORLEVEL commands to step
through the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

NOTE: This information does not apply to later versions of MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The CHOICE command provides the ability to prompt for input while running a
batch file program. With the CHOICE command, you can display a specified prompt
and then pause for user input. For example, if you add the following line to a
batch file program

   " CHOICE /C:ABC Choose an Option " (without the quotation marks)

the user sees the following when CHOICE is started:

   Choose an Option [A,B,C,]?

For more information on using the CHOICE command, type "help choice" (without the
quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt.
