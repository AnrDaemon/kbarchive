SUMMARY
=======

Disabling 32-bit disk access can improve hard drive performance if you have a
system BIOS or hard drive controller designed and optimized specifically for
your hard drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some hard drive controllers have built-in optimizing routines that are similar
to those that the 32-Bit Disk Access system uses. In these cases, 32-bit disk
access can degrade hard drive performance because some optimization routiness
may occur multiple times for each disk operation. This results in slower overall
disk access.

Consult your hardware documentation to see if your hard drive controller or BIOS
provides any built-in disk access optimizations that may make the use of 32-bit
disk access unnecessary. Check your Windows documentation for the advantages of
using 32-bit disk access.
