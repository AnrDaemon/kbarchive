SUMMARY
=======

If you print entries from Musical Instruments, you may find that the graphics
print at a low resolution. This product was primarily designed to be viewed on
your screen and not for printing. For more information on printing from Musical
Instruments, see the program's README.TXT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The pictures in Musical Instruments are anti-aliased. Each picture is composed
of combinations of black and gray pixels. The pictures were designed to display
well on the screen. However, because of the anti-aliasing, they do not have a
high print quality.

You can see the alternated pixels of black and gray if you copy a graphic to a
utility such as BitEdit or IconEdit, which allows you to view the individual
pixels of which the picture is made.

Additional query words: multimedia multi media multi-media low res dpi image jagged stairstep grey
