The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Page 4-58 of the "Commands & Functions" manual incorrectly indicates that
READKEY() will return exit codes or update codes if the CTRL+PAGE UP or
CTRL+PAGE DOWN key combinations are pressed. These key combinations do not exit
a full screen command on the Macintosh. Therefore, READKEY() will not return any
integer values.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The READKEY() function returns an integer value representing the key or keys
pressed by the user to exit a full screen command. Keys other than CTRL+PAGE UP
and CTRL+PAGE DOWN can be used to exit the full screen command; READKEY() will
return the value for the keys used.
