-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.0, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are unable to resize Microsoft Backup for Windows or other Windows- based
applications. The complete contents of the window may not be visible when it is
maximized; part of the interface may be truncated.

CAUSE
=====

The Helv= setting in the [FontSubstitutes] section of the WIN.INI file has been
modified or the MS Sans Serif font is not installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, do the following:

1. Edit the WIN.INI file and change the Helv= setting in the [FontSubstitutes]
   section so that it matches the following:

   Helv=MS Sans Serif

2. Ensure "MS Sans Serif=Arial" in not in the WIN.INI file.

3. Check the [fonts] section in WIN.INI file to make sure it has the correct
   entry. For example, if you are using the VGA video driver, the entry should
   read as follows:

   MS Sans Serif 8,10,12,14,18,24 (VGA res)=SSERIFE.FON

4. If the MS Sans Serif font is not installed, choose the Font icon in Control
   Panel to install it.
