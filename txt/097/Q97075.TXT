TITLE   :PC WRmt: Cannot Switch Tasks While Mail Waits for Retry Count
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While Microsoft Mail Remote version 3.2 for Windows waits for the Retry Delay
after it fails to connect to a valid modem line, you cannot activate another
application or process.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior reflects a design constraint of the product. Mail Remote for
Windows does not support switching tasks while the modem session is active.
While Mail delays before sending another command to the modem, it is considered
an active modem session.


Additional query words: 3.20
