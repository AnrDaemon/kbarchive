SUMMARY
=======

Handling fonts in Microsoft Windows-based applications can involve a lot of
grunt work. For example, essential tasks such as creating fonts, retrieving
point sizes, and calculating text metrics can take up a lot of the developer's
time and effort. This article describes some useful font-handling functions that
take care of most of this tedious work, thus making it easier to create and
manipulate fonts in Windows.

The FONTUTIL sample application demonstrates most of the font-handling functions
discussed in this technical article. FONTUTIL contains useful font-handling
routines that make it easier for an application to create and manipulate fonts
in Microsoft Windows by taking care of most of the tedious work.

The font utilities are primarily for applications that need the relatively
simplistic font model presented in the ChooseFont common dialog box.
ChooseFont() deals with fonts using four primary variables: typeface name,
typeface style, point size, and effects. ChooseFont also allows for color
selection, but the font-handling functions do not currently support this
feature.

The font-handling functions allow an application to create and interrogate fonts
in a manner that is consistent with the ChooseFont model. For example, you can
create a font by using the ReallyCreateFont() function and specifying the
typeface name, typeface style, and point size; you can retrieve the typeface
style of a font by using the GetTextStyle() function; and so on.

The font utility functions support Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1, and
Windows NT version 3.1. You can include the functions either in an application
or in a Dynamic-Link Library (DLL).
