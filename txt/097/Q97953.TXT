======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows (MWAV) may report either of the following error
messages:

 - Insufficient DOS Memory

 - Insufficient MS-DOS Memory

 - Not Enough Memory

This problem can occur in both standard and 386 enhanced modes.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by incompatible terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
programs or by third-party video drivers.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

1. Use the Interactive Startup feature to start your computer without

loading unnecessary TSRs. For more information on Interactive Startup, see the
"Configuring Your System" chapter in the "User's Guide."
2. Run Microsoft Windows Anti-Virus right after you start Microsoft Windows
   (that is, before you run other applications).

3. Try using a video driver provided with Microsoft Windows 3.1 or 3.11, such as
   the standard VGA video driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Microsoft Anti-Virus requests this memory, the program has to share the
640-kilobyte (K) conventional MS-DOS memory with the Windows kernel and any
other terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs loaded prior to running
Windows. Windows drivers and other Windows-based applications also use
conventional memory. These Windows-based applications, when closed, should free
this conventional memory however, some do not.
