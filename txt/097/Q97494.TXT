SUMMARY
=======

If you want to benchmark throughput with TCP/IP on LAN Manager across routers
and a link, set the following parameters first to improve performance.

Set a tcpwindowsize larger than default. This is especially important for
performance on high-delay links. To achieve the best performance, try a
tcpsegmentsize of 1450, and a tcpwindowsize of at least 4350, on both client and
server. These values offer a significant improvement over the defaults.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 2.10a 2.20
