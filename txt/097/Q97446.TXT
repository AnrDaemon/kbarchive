TITLE   :Third Party Software Shares Files on NetWare

SUMMARY
=======

NetWare has a FLAG function with which you can set file access permissions to
read, write, or share. Some third party software can run on NetWare with FLAG
set to shareable but cannot share files on LAN Manager 2.1.

FLAG is similar in function to MS-NET compatibility mode. The heuristic reacts
differently when you use HPFS386.

Check the value for SRVHEURISTIC 11, which controls the way the server regulates
access to .EXE, .COM and .BAT files when more than one workstation requests
access. Try setting it 0 (always use compatibility mode).

You can also check heuristic 5, which supports file control block (FCB) opens.
This heuristic is useful only with MS-DOS workstations on the network. The
default is 1 (active).
