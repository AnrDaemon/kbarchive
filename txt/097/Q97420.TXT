PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message if you attempt to install MS-DOS
from a drive other than A:

   Current Drive Must be set to A

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur when one or more of the following conditions
exists:

 - Your CMOS settings are incorrectly set and do not include your floppy disk
   drive.

 - You are using a high-capacity optical drive with removable disks (called a
   "floptical" drive) and the device driver for it is incompatible with Setup.

 - You are using an external floppy disk drive and the device driver for it is
   incompatible with Setup.

 - You are using a 2.88-megabyte (MB) floppy disk controller. (Some of these use
   extended BIOS chip sets that are incompatible with Setup.)

WORKAROUND
==========

If your drive C has at least 9 MB free space, you can work around this problem
by copying the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade files to your hard disk drive and running Setup
from your hard disk drive. To do this, use the following steps:

1. Create a temporary directory on your drive C. For example, type "MD DOSTEMP"
   (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press
   ENTER.

2. Copy the MS-DOS Upgrade files from each floppy disk to the DOSTEMP directory.
   For example, type "copy b:\*.* c:\dostemp" (without the quotation marks) at
   the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

3. To run Setup, type "c:\dostemp\setup" (without the quotation marks) at the
   MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.
