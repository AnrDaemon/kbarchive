-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start MS-DOS MemMaker you may receive the following error message:

   MemMaker cannot continue: Your computer's startup drive is write-protected,
   or its drive letter is being used by a network drive. Exit Memmaker and
   remove the write protection or disconnect from the network drive. Then,
   restart MemMaker.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because of one of the following conditions:

 - The SET TMP and / or SET TEMP statements in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file point to an
   invalid directory name.

 - A file exists in the hard disk's root directory that has the same name as the
   directory specified in the TMP or TEMP variables.

 - There are 512 files in the root directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To solve the problem, change the SET TMP= and / or SET TEMP= variables in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file to point to a valid directory, or rename a file in your hard
disk's root directory, or delete/move some of the files in the root directory.
