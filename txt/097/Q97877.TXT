The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows versions 1991 edition, 1992 edition, 1993 edition 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer, versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you resize the main Bookshelf window so that it is smaller than the size of
the Pronunciation Key Popup window in the American Heritage Dictionary, the
popup will also make itself smaller. The shorter you make the main Bookshelf
window, the shorter the popup becomes.

This behavior is by design. Microsoft Multimedia Viewer (the program that
displays the popups and screens for Bookshelf) resizes the popup so that it
always fits within the main Bookshelf window.
