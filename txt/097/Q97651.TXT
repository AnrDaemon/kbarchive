TITLE   :PC WRmt Win: Problems Installing with DoubleSpace
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install both version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows and
version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, and when you use the
Microsoft MS-DOS version 6.0 DoubleSpace utility, if actual disk space is low,
Mail Remote for Windows may create a corrupt (incomplete) message store file
(MSMAIL.MMF), and Mail for Windows will not start.

CAUSE
=====

When hard disk space is low, DoubleSpace incorrectly reports the amount
available to use.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft MS-DOS 6 includes an item in the README.TXT file explaining that
encrypted files, such as MSMAIL.MMF, are not compressed with utilities such as
DoubleSpace or Stacker. However, performance can be improved if you store the
.MMF on an uncompressed drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft MS-DOS version 6.0 and
DoubleSpace. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
