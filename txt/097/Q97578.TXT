-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SUMMARY
=======

DoubleSpace can be used to compress a Hardcard drive (other than the startup
drive) that requires a driver in the CONFIG.SYS file. However, DoubleSpace may
not automatically mount such a drive at system startup because the DoubleSpace
driver (DBLSPACE.BIN) is loaded with IO.SYS before MS-DOS processes the
CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a special device driver is necessary to use a drive (other than your startup
drive), you can compress that drive with DoubleSpace. However, when you start
your computer, DoubleSpace does not automatically mount the drive because
DoubleSpace cannot access the drive at system startup.

If you cannot access your compressed drive after installing DoubleSpace on your
Hardcard, try one of the following:

 - Edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to add the DBLSPACE /MOUNT command to mount the
   compressed volume file on the Hardcard each time you start your computer.

 - Verify that your CONFIG.SYS file loads at least one device driver (for
   example, ANSI.SYS) after the device driver for your Hardcard but before the
   DBLSPACE.SYS driver.

For more information, see section 4.2c of the README.TXT file.

NOTE: If your startup drive requires a device driver in CONFIG.SYS, do not
compress that drive. If you compress the startup drive, your computer cannot
start properly because DoubleSpace cannot access the startup drive.

To install DoubleSpace on a computer where the startup drive requires a special
device driver, use DoubleSpace Setup to compress a drive other than your startup
drive, or use DoubleSpace Setup to create a new compressed drive using free
space on any existing drive.

For more information on using DoubleSpace to compress a startup drive that
requires a driver in CONFIG.SYS, query on the following words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   "hardcard" (without the quotation marks) and "startup" (without the quotation
   marks) and "compressed" (without the quotation marks) and "dblspace" (without
   the quotation marks)
