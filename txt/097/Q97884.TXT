SYMPTOMS
========

The DBLSPACE /CHKDSK command takes excessive time or appears to stop responding
(hang) while evaluating cross-linked files.

CAUSE
=====

The DBLSPACE /CHKDSK command evaluates errors and then sorts them into three
categories: lost clusters, cross-linked files, and other errors. If the command
determines that your system has cross-linked files, DBLSPACE /CHKDSK attempts to
backtrack through the directory chain to identify the files responsible.

If DBLSPACE /CHKDSK appears to hang while evaluating cross-linked files, it may
be because your directory structure is damaged and therefore invalid. (You can
use the TREE command to check the directory structure.)

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, do the following:

1. If you have Delete Sentry enabled, disable it. (Delete Sentry prevents you
   from deleting the cross-linked files.)

2. If you need to preserve the files in the damaged directory, use a third-party
   DoubleSpace-compatible disk repair program, such as Norton Disk Doctor, to
   repair the directory.

   If you don't need to save the files in the directory, issue the CHKDSK /F
   command to correct the bad directory. (This runs DBLSPACE /CHKDSK and
   identifies the cross-linked files)

3. Delete the cross-linked files.
