TITLE   :PC WRmt: New MMF Created in Apparently Incorrect Location

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Microsoft Mail Remote version 3.2 for Windows cannot locate your message
store file (MSMAIL.MMF), it automatically creates a new message store file. Mail
prompts for the file name and location. The initial prompt shown is based on the
file location in the OfflineMessages parameter in the MSMAIL.INI file in your
Windows directory (by default, C:\WINDOWS).

If you change to a new directory in the prompt dialog box, Mail creates the file
in the directory it originally displayed and ignores the change of the directory
location for the message store file.

CAUSE
=====

Even though this behavior appears to create the file in an incorrect location,
Mail is designed to perform in this manner.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Perform the following three steps to demonstrate this behavior.

1. Delete your MMF and edit your MSMAIL.INI file to indicate a different
   location for the OfflineMessages parameter. In this example, store the file
   in the C:\NEW directory, as follows:

   [Microsoft Mail]
   OfflineMessages=C:\NEW\MSMAIL.MMF

2. Start Mail. As expected, Mail displays the "Your message file could not be
   found" message and displays the Open Message File dialog box. The current
   directory in the message box is C:\NEW.

3. In the Directory list box, change the directory to a different directory, for
   example, to C:\DOS. Then choose New.

Mail creates the MSMAIL.MMF file in the C:\NEW directory rather than in the
C:\DOS directory as you chose in the Open Message File dialog box. The
OfflineMessages setting in the edited MSMAIL.INI file remains (as C:\NEW in this
example). You might expect Mail to create MSMAIL.MMF in the C:\DOS directory.

Each Mail version 3.x for Windows client acts in the same manner with respect to
the OfflineMessages setting and creating the MMF file.
