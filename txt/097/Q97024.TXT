SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail Remote version 3.2 for Windows, if you want to change mail
drivers, you must first send all of your messages (empty your Outbox). If you
change mail drivers, any messages composed before you change drivers never leave
the Outbox.

Microsoft Mail identifies each message with a mail system type to ensure
delivery. If your mailbox is not empty before you change drivers, Mail does not
send the message because no available driver supports the mail system those
messages require.

Because the message remains in your Outbox, each time you exit Mail Remote for
Windows, Mail prompts you to send the mail waiting in your Outbox. You must
reload the driver you used to create the waiting messages to send them.
