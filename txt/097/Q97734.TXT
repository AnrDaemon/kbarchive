Mail 2.x folders to Mail 3.0 or 3.2, CONVERT.EXE may report a network error and
then exit.

The CONVERT.EXE program assumes the owner field in the .IDX file is in all
uppercase letters and does not know how to handle hexadecimal numbers in
lowercase letters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. This problem was corrected in version 3.2a.
