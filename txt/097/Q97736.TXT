======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows for Workgroups, when you try to open a file in a shared directory on
another machine from Paradox for Windows, you receive the following error
message:

   Network initialization failed, cannot access Network lock file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To access files on other machines in a Windows for Workgroups network, you need
to use the SUBST command locally, at the server machine (the computer with the
shared directory), before you start Windows for Workgroups. For more
information, check your Paradox documentation for information about using
Paradox on a peer-to-peer network.

The SUBST command lets you substitute a string for a path and allows you to
associate a path with a drive letter. For more information about SUBST, refer to
your MS-DOS "User's Guide" or MS-DOS Help.

If you don't want to use SUBST with your Windows for Workgroups configuration,
you can use DoubleSpace. If you already have DoubleSpace installed, run
DBLSPACE.EXE and choose Create New Drive from the Compress menu. If you have not
yet installed DoubleSpace and you don't want to compress your hard drive(s), run
DBLSPACE.EXE and choose Custom Setup. When you create the new drive, choose the
drive letter required by Paradox.

NOTE: You may also want to resize the drive so that it doesn't take up more disk
space than is required for the Paradox files.
