TITLE   :NETLOGON Fails with Valid Directory, Correct Permissions
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

NETLOGON can sometimes fail to load, even though the path specified for scripts
points to a valid directory, permissions are correctly set, and there are no bad
disk sectors. It fails because the userpath must have a directory under it
called scripts.

SYMPTOMS
========

When the primary domain controller tries to load the NETLOGON service, it causes
error NET3056, followed by a message that the path specified in the userpath or
scripts does not match (NET5600).

During a boot, if you try to start the Server service and NETLOGON fails, then
Server fails also. Trying to start NETLOGON first brings up a message that the
Server is not started and a prompt to enter (Y/N) for starting it. If you enter
Y, Server service starts but NETLOGON continues to fail.

This problem has been reported when the path specified for scripts in the
LANMAN.INI file points to a valid directory with proper permissions according to
the manual, and when CHKDSK does not locate any bad disk sections.

CAUSE
=====

The path specified in userpath must have a directory under it called "scripts,"
or NETLOGON will not start.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create the necessary subdirectory. For example, if

   userpath = accounts\users

then you must create a subdirectory called

   <lanroot>\accounts\users\scripts
