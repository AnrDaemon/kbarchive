The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

If the Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) program group in Microsoft Windows Program
Manager becomes corrupted or if it is deleted, you can use the MSVC Setup
program to restore the group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you specify the /F option switch on the MSVC Setup command line, Setup does
not copy any files. It only updates the MSVC group in Program Manager and the
SYSTEM.INI and TOOLS.INI files. To create or restore the MSVC group, perform the
following five steps:

1. Insert Microsoft Visual C++ Disk 1 into a floppy disk drive or insert the
   Microsoft Visual C++ CD into your CD-ROM drive. The following instructions
   assume that this drive is drive X.

2. In the Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

3. If you are using Visual C++ for Windows 1.0 or 1.5 or Visual C++ 32-bit
   Edition version 1.0, enter the following command line in the Run dialog box:

   x:setup /F

   Note: The "F" must be an uppercase letter.

   In Visual C++ 2.0, the setup program does not accept the /F parameter. Use the
   following command in the Run dialog box instead:

   x:\msvc20\vcsetup /f

   In Visual C++ 4.0, the AUTOVC.EXE program does not accept any parameters.
   Instead, use the following command line in the Run dialog box:

   x:\msdev\setup /F

   In Visual C++ 5.0, use the following command line in the Run dialog box:

   x:\DevStudio\Vc\setup /F

4. Click OK.

5. Specify information about your system according to the instructions in the
   Setup program. When Setup runs, it does not copy any files but it does create
   the appropriate program groups and icons. Toward the end of the process,
   accept the default option to write the SYSTEM.INI and TOOLS.INI files to a
   different name if asked (to prevent the new information from overwriting the
   current files). When Setup is complete, it is not necessary to restart
   Windows.

Even though Setup does not copy any files, it displays every screen (checking for
available disk space, and so on). Furthermore, the Visual C++ for Windows NT
Setup program prompts the user to register environment variables (which is one
method to register the environment variables if you have not already done so).
