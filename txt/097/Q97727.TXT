The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A computer with an 80286 processor is capable of running Windows for Workgroups
in standard mode only. The standard mode of Windows for Workgroups requires that
the real-mode network redirector be started for network functionality before
Windows for Workgroups is started.

On an 80286-based computer, the NET START statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
starts the real-mode redirector and prompts the user for logon information. On a
computer with an 80386 or higher processor, the NET START statement does not
normally start the real- mode redirector.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Windows for Workgroups is installed on a 80286-based computer, the
statement AutoStart=full is added to the SYSTEM.INI file in the [network]
section. This parameter causes the NET START statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
to perform a binding of the network protocol(s) to the network adapter as well
as starting the full real-mode redirector. The redirector then prompts the user
for a logon name.

For additional information about values for the AutoStart= line, refer to page
6-65 of the "Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit" for version 3.1 or
query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   net start and autostart
