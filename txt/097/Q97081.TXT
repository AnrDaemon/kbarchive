The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows does not support listening in
the background for incoming telephone calls as version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for MS-DOS does. This behavior reflects a Mail Remote for Windows design
limitation.

Mail Remote for Windows does not support multitasking, switching tasks, or
background processing while the modem is active. Mail Remote for Windows
supports using the modem only to call the postoffice to send and receive mail
messages.

If you need to contact your postoffice frequently, you can use the Session Setup
command on the Mail menu to schedule connection times.

Mail Remote for Windows does not support the LISTEN function that Mail Remote for
MS-DOS provides.
