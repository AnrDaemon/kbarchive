TITLE   :Use MSnull/IBMnull Driver with HP IIIsi Printer
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

For reasons that are discussed below, the MSnull or IBMnull drivers are the best
to use on a server to run Hewlett-Packard (HP) IIIsi printers on LAN Manager.

Any print job you send from an application already has the required print
information embedded, so you don't need a specific driver such as the IIIsi on
the server. As a rule, you want a driver on the server to be as generic as
possible so that jobs--which applications have already formatted with necessary
code--print without being processed by anything else. Set applicable null driver
switches such as Default Spool Type to RAW, and set the Form Feed control to
NONE.

This is the cleanest way to set up a print server for all workstation
environments except OS/2 workstations.
