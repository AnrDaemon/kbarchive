SUMMARY
=======

VLB.exe implements a single-selection, single-column virtual list box that is
capable of displaying millions of items. The standard list box control in
Microsoft Windows can contain a limited number of items. VLB.exe shows how to
implement list boxes that exceed this limitation.

The standard list box control in Microsoft Windows can contain a limited number
of items. Applications may need to implement list boxes that exceed this
limitation. This article introduces a custom control called VLIST, which is a
virtual list box capable of displaying millions of items. Part 1 of the article
provides instructions for using the VLIST virtual list box, and documents the
styles and messages that VLIST supports. Part 2 describes how VLIST was
implemented, and discusses the problems encountered and decisions made during
the implementation; readers who would like to modify VLIST or implement their
own virtual list box may find this section interesting. For a working example of
VLIST, see the Microsoft Developer Network CD---the topic listing in the Index
window was implemented with VLIST.
