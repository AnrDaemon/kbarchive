 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you copy a list of author names from Bartlett's Familiar Quotations into
Word for Windows, the first line of text is incorrectly formatted. The first
line is bold and underlined in 12 point Arial. The rest of the text is formatted
for Times New Roman 10 point. All the text should be formatted for Times New
Roman 10 point, and none of it should be bold or underlined.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, copy the text by selecting Copy from the Edit menu rather
than using the Send button.

2. Click one of the alphabet buttons. This produces a list of author names, each
   followed by birth and death dates.

3. Click Send.

4. Switch to Word for Windows and look at the copied text.

The text is incorrectly formatted, as described above.

This problem occurs in Windows 95.
