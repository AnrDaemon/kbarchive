KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are retrieving mail with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows
and you are disconnected before all of your mail has been downloaded, you may
receive duplicate messages the next time you retrieve mail. Messages that have
already been received may download again.

CAUSE
=====

EXTERNAL.EXE from version 3.0, 3.0a, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
only marks mail delivered when all messages have been downloaded. Being
disconnected causes EXTERNAL.EXE not to have a complete list of messages to
download. As a result, it downloads the entire list, even though some messages
might have been already downloaded.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only workaround is to use the Session Setup command to retrieve only
selected message headers instead of all unread messages. Follow these steps:

1. From the View menu, choose Headers.

2. Select the messages you want to retrieve. Select the messages that you know
   you do not already have.

3. Choose the Retrieve button.

   If you mark a message by mistake, select the message and choose the Retrieve
   button again. This returns the message to its original status.

4. To download the mail immediately, choose the Connect Now button. Otherwise it
   will be delivered the next time Mail Remote connects with the postoffice.

5. Choose the OK button.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
