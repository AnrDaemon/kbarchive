The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The installation process for version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows
prompts you to install the Mail Remote data files.

This disk is not provided with Mail Remote for Windows. Your mail administrator
uses the Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) included with version 3.0 or 3.2
of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks to create the data files appropriate for your
system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The user data files can be stored on a floppy disk, in a directory on your local
hard disk, or on a file server. When you are prompted for the disk during
installation, enter the full path to the directory in which the files are
stored. This field supports the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) so you can
enter the name of the server immediately before the name of the file (for
example, \\SEATTLE\MAIL\REMOTE). If your network supports UNC, Mail
automatically creates a link to that server and location.

To create the data files in the ADMIN.EXE program, select the REMOTE option from
the main menu. Select either INIT-DISK to create a new disk for the remote user,
or select UPDATE-DISK to quickly update an existing remote user data disk.

For more information on the administrative issues related to setting up remote
client users, please refer to chapter 11 of the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
"Administrator's Guide" for version 3.0.
