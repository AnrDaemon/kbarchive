The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up Windows with an ATI Ultra Pro video board, Setup may
automatically detect the video board as an 8514 adapter. Setup may stop
responding (hang) when it actually starts Windows (a gray screen is displayed at
this point) if the board is set up incorrectly.

CAUSE
=====

According to ATI Technologies, the ATI Ultra Pro video card, which uses the Mach
32 chip set, is fully compatible with the IBM 8514 adapter and should work with
the Windows 8514 video driver if set up properly.

Windows hangs if the video card is set up incorrectly. When you set up the Mach
32 board with the installation program, you use the Set Power-Up Configuration
option. In the Set Power-Up Configuration dialog box, you set the VGA Memory
Size option. This option tells the card how much memory to dedicate for the VGA
portion of the adapter.

According to ATI Technical Support, it is a common mistake to set up this option
to use all the memory on the adapter. Doing so causes Windows to hang if you are
using an 8514 driver. This option should be set to half the total memory on the
board (which is usually 512 kilobytes [K] because most Mach 32 boards come with
1 megabyte [MB] of VRAM. The configuration can also be set to "Shared," which
allows VGA and 8514 programs to share the VRAM on the card; however, this
setting may not always correct the problem. Specifying the amount of memory is
the most reliable way to ensure Windows does not hang.

The ATI Ultra Pro is manufactured by ATI Technologies, Inc., a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
