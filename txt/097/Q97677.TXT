SUMMARY
=======

Under certain conditions it may be necessary to ensure that MS-DOS recognizes
the presence of the Windows Sound System board. The following MS-DOS Debug
script can be used to test for the presence of the hardware that ships with
Windows Sound System versions 1.0 and 1.0a. The following example assumes that
the Base I/O address on the card is set for 530.

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type "debug" (without the quotation marks).
   This command starts Debug, a program that allows you to test and debug
   executable files. When Debug is started, the prompt will be a hyphen (-).

2. Type "i 534" (without the quotation marks). This command reads and displays
   the byte value at the specified port address. If your port address is
   something other than 530, type "i XXX" (without the quotation marks), where
   XXX represents your port address plus 4. The returned value should be 01.

3. Type "o 534 c" (without the quotation marks). This command sends the value of
   a byte to the specified output port. If your port address is something other
   than 530, type "i XXX" (without the quotation marks), where XXX represents
   your port address plus 4.

4. Type "i 535" (without the quotation marks). This command reads and displays
   the byte value at the specified port address. If your port address is
   something other than 530, type "i XXX" (without the quotation marks), where
   XXX represents your port address plus 5. The returned value should be 09.

5. Type "i 533" (without the quotation marks). This command reads and displays
   the byte value at the specified port address. If your port address is
   something other than 530, type "i XXX" (without the quotation marks), where
   XXX represents your port address plus 3. The returned valued should be 4.

If the returned values are other than those stated above, MS-DOS is not able to
sense the presence of the Windows Sound System hardware. You may want to try
setting the board at a different port address and see if the Windows Sound
System drivers install. If this test fails with the other settings it could be
the result of a damaged board or other hardware conflict.
