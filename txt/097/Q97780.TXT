SUMMARY
=======

When you try to start Beethoven version 1.0 on a computer with a Magnavox 461
CD-ROM drive, the following error message appears:

   The wrong disk is in the CD-ROM drive. Please insert the Multimedia Beethoven
   CD. Click retry...

This problem occurs because the Magnavox 461 CD-ROM drive is not Multimedia PC
(MPC) compliant, and because Beethoven checks for the length of the CD, which
the Magnavox driver incorrectly reports.

Beethoven 1.1 checks for tracks and audio length. This error should not occur in
Beethoven 1.1.

Additional query words: 1.00 multimedia multi media multi-media mpc stringent relaxed
