TITLE   :/N Switch Turns off Verification Search for Protocol
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Minses provides the interface between LAN Manager for MS-DOS and NetBIOS. Before
it loads, minses normally verifies that there is a protocol driver at Int 5c.
Demand protocol architecture protocols such as NetBEUI are loaded after the
workstation (including Minses) starts, so the verification fails and Minses
refuses to load. The /n switch (which should be turned on by the LAN Manager
Setup program) turns the minses verification search off.

The /q parameter disables the Minses beep.
