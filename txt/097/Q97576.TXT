SYMPTOMS

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

following error messages:

   DoubleSpace Cannot Copy The File DBLSPACE.INF

   -or-

   DoubleSpace cannot copy DBLSPACE.BIN

The root directory of the drive contains an excessive number of entries. The
root directory of a hard disk can contain up to 512 entries,including both files
and directories.

NOTE: The first error message can also be generated when the files DBLSPACE.INF
or DBLSPACE.HLP are not in the DOS directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

Reduce the number of entries in the root directory.
