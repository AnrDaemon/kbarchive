A toolbar consists of a row of small, graphical buttons usually placed across the
top of a window. It gives the user a fast and convenient alternative to using
the window's menu to perform operations. The menu provides a more easily
understood way to activate a function and includes a keyboard interface to the
function. A toolbar, on the other hand, gives the experienced user a shortcut to
operations, and thus improves the usability of an application.

TOOLBAR is a companion sample application for the "Creating a Toolbar" technical
article on the Microsoft Developer Network CD.

TOOLBAR was built and tested under Microsoft Windows version 3.1. The sample also
builds and runs under Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 and Visual C++ version 1.0.
