SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.x of Microsoft Excel for Windows is one of the first applications to
use OLE. It predates much of the OLE functionality described in the current
specifications used by Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1.

Because Excel 3.x is older than the current OLE specification, it behaves
differently than other, more recent, OLE client applications.

In Excel 3.x, you cannot play embedded objects; you can only edit them. Multiverb
objects, such as Sound or Note-It objects, cannot be played or run. If you try
to play an embedded object by double-clicking it, the respective editing program
comes up instead.

For example, if you run Quick Recorder and embed a .WAV file, the icon will be
displayed. However, when you double-click to play the file, the Quick Recorder
will run instead.

Excel 4.0 fully implements the OLE 1.0 specification.
