TITLE   :Err Msg: "Invalid Drive Specification" with Novell Network
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.x,4.x,5.x,6.0,6.2,6.22

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

If you set the LASTDRIVE variable to Z and are using a Novell network, the
following error message may be displayed:

   invalid drive specification

CAUSE
=====

A Novell network sets its network drive to the first drive letter not taken by
MS-DOS. For example, if LASTDRIVE is equal to H, the network drive is assigned
to I.

If LASTDRIVE is set to Z, MS-DOS has taken all the drive letters; therefore, none
are available for the network.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set LASTDRIVE to something other than Z.

Novell networks are manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or
reliability.
