======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to MS-DOS 6.0 or later, a "not enough memory" error message
may appear or your system may stop responding (hang) when you try to run an
application generated with Computer Associates' Clipper program.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, add the NOEMS and NOVCPI switches to the EMM386.EXE
command in your CONFIG.SYS file. For example:

   device=c:\dos\emm386.exe noems novcpi

The application generated with Clipper should now run on your system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can also work around this problem by using the RAM switch instead of the
NOEMS switch with EMM386.EXE or you can remove the DEVICE= statement for
EMM386.EXE from your CONFIG.SYS file.

EMM386.EXE is a Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) server. VCPI is a
program interface that allows expanded memory services (EMS) emulators and DOS
extenders to coexist within a 80386/80486 environment.

NOTE: Clipper is an XBASE compiler.

Clipper is manufactured by Computer Associates International, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
