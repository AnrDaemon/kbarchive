TITLE   :PC WRmt: Mail Does Not Display Friendly Names from Headers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use headers for mail retrieval with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows, the messages listed show only mailbox names, not friendly
names. This makes choosing which messages to download difficult if you are
looking for messages from known senders.

It is not possible to get the friendly name from the message header.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Shared File System (SFS) transport never looks up the friendly
names because they are already contained in the message. As a result, there is
no support to look up a mailbox entry and return the friendly name associated
with that mailbox.

To provide this, the headers dialog would have to search all the entries in the
appropriate address directories and check to see if the given mailbox is in the
list and then return the associated friendly name. Because of the time required
to search, it is not appropriate for relatively slow telephone/modem
connections.

It could not be guaranteed to work on all addresses because messages coming
through gateways may not have entries in any of the address directories (that
is, the Global Address List (GAL), local postoffice or Personal Address Book
(PAB)), but they may still have a friendly name in message header somewhere.

It is not possible to get the friendly name without the mail item itself. Mail
cannot do a look-up of the friendly name because mailbox IDs are unique only
within the same postoffice, and we do not know which postoffice the mail header
came from.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
