TITLE   :Unwanted String Begins Messages Redirected by XPAD
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

An incorrect or unwanted string sometimes begins messages sent through XPAD
redirection. The problem is caused by connection through a NULL modem cable.

SYMPTOMS
========

The X.25 PAD is often used for testing remote access services because it allows
a PC with a modem to access one PAD COM port, then redirects the connection to
another PAD COM port that has a LAN Man server running RAS.

Sometimes, however, the first word the RAS client software sends is unwanted. In
one reported instance, the word "client" began every message, causing a problem
because it is an invalid command for the PAD, which requires a string such as
"call/local 1" before it initiates a redirection.

CAUSE
=====

This can be caused by connecting to the PAD through a null modem cable.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can fix this by modifying PAD.INF, but it is not the best way to do it. If
your connections are successfully completing, leave PAD.INF alone and go to the
MODEMS.INF file. Find the Null Modem section. The unwanted string ("client" in
the previous example) is in the Dial Command section. Replace it with
"call/local 1" or whatever string you require.
