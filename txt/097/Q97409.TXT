SUMMARY
=======

Adding dynamic data exchange (DDE) server support to an application has never
been easier. This article describes a code module you can include in your own
application that makes adding DDE server support trivial. The code module makes
use of the dynamic data exchange management library (DDEML) to implement the DDE
protocol and provides the following features:

 - Full System topic support

 - An application programming interface (API) to dynamically add and remove
   topics and topic/item pairs

 - An API to dynamically add and remove DDE execute commands to a topic

 - Automatic tracking of conversations

 - Built-in execute command parser

 - Partial support for the Execute Control 1 protocol, which allows a result
   string to be returned in response to a DDE execute command request

This article requires considerable familiarity with DDE concepts---it's not a
good place to start learning about DDE. Please refer to the Microsoft Windows
version 3.1 Software Development Kit (SDK) Programmer's Reference, Volume 1:
Overview, Part 2: Extension Libraries for a general introduction to DDE and
DDEML. The following articles on the Microsoft Developer Network CD (Technical
Articles, Windows Articles, OLE and DDE Articles) provide more detail on various
DDE topics:

 - "DDE Execute Strings"

 - "DDE Hot Links"

 - "Performing DDE from a Dynamic-Link Library"

 - "Raw DDE"

 - "Supporting the Clipboard, DDE, and OLE in Applications"

 - "Supporting the DDE System Topic"

DDESERV shows how you can easily create a dynamic data exchange (DDE) server that
supports the System topic and an Execute command set. You can build the server
by using the STDDDE.C module included in the sample.
