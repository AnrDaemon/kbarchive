-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Mail Remote version 3.2 for Windows, when you create a custom view
and select all Network Postoffices and all Users on Postoffices, the Address
Book shows a blank line after the name of the network on which the user resides.

CAUSE
=====

In the network list, one network has only one postoffice (the local postoffice).
The network list has an entry without a postoffice because the postoffice list
names the postoffice. If Mail listed each local postoffice in the network list,
the network list would duplicate the local postoffice list.

For example, in the network Microsoft, the WGC postoffice list is as follows:

  Personal Address Book
  Global Address List
  Postoffice List ----|   Because these two lists would be the same,
  Other Networks      |-- Mail does not show PO1 as a postoffice.
    Network1          |   Consequently, the Network1 network contains
       PO1 -----------|   no postoffice.
