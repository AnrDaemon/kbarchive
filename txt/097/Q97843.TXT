TITLE   :Addicons Adds Program Groups and Icons to Program Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager

SUMMARY
=======

Because LAN Manager 2.2 setup is MS-DOS-based and requires dynamic data
exchange, Setup uses the Addicons utility as a proxy to add icons to the Program
Manager.

During installation, Setup creates an ADDICONS.INI file--which describes what
program groups to create and what icons to put in them--then adds Addicons to
the LOAD= line of WIN.INI.

The first time Windows is loaded after LAN Manager setup, Addicons reads its .INI
file, adds the groups and icons, removes itself from the WIN.INI LOAD= line, and
exits.

Here is a sample .INI file in which two groups are made: Group1 (LAN Manager) has
one program added, and TestGrp (The cool test group!) has two programs added.

[groups]
  group1=LAN Manager
  TestGrp=The cool test group!

[group1]
  1=NetAdmin,c:\lm22.dos\netprog\netadmin.exe

[TestGrp]
  1=notepad,notepad.exe
  2=Wonder Term, c:\windows\bogus\path\to\wondtrm.exe

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 a 2.20
