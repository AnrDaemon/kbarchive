The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running Symantec's Norton Utilities Erase Protect (EP.EXE) or Norton
Desktop for Windows (NDW) SmartErase, Microsoft Defragmenter (Defrag) sees many
files as unmovable. (Clusters of these files are graphically represented by the
letter X).

CAUSE
=====

Erase Protect and Smart Erase are delete-tracking programs that temporarily
store deleted files in a hidden directory called SMARTCAN. Defrag sees the files
in the hidden directory as unmovable.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, empty the SMARTCAN directory before you run Defrag.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on Erase Protect, SmartErase, and emptying the SMARTCAN
directory, refer to your Norton Utilities or Norton Desktop for Windows
documentation.

Norton Utilities Erase Protect and Norton Desktop for Windows SmartErase are
manufactured by Symantec, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
