This article presents a usable explanation of the GetGlyphOutline() function.

the definition found in the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 Software Development
Kit (SDK) Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions. To follow the discussion,
the reader should be familiar with the information on GetGlyphOutline() in the
SDK and the basic theory of the TrueType font engine. A sample application,
GLYPH, is included on the Microsoft Developer Network CD to illustrate the basic
concepts and mechanisms in this article.
