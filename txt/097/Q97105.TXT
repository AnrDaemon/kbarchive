-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run version 2.0 or 2.5 of Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS in extended mode
with MS-DOS 6.x, you may receive an error message stating that the memory
manager is incompatible.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Edit your CONFIG.SYS file to add the RAM parameter to the command for
   EMM386.EXE and remove the NOEMS parameter. For example:

      device=c:\dos\emm386.exe ram

-or-

 - Run MemMaker. When you are asked if you use any programs that need expanded
   memory, set the option to "Yes."

This problem does not occur if you are running FoxPro 2.0 for MS-DOS in standard
mode, FoxPro for MS-DOS 2.5 in any mode, or FoxPro for Windows.
