TITLE   :LAN Man Does Not Turn On WRITE-THRU by Default
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

LANMAN.INI simply shows an X instead of a 1 or 0 for WRITE-THRU, so it is
difficult to tell what the setting means. Here is the information you need to
get more safety for DB writes, as well as some processing benefits:

0 - WRITE-THRU is set on all opens (and writes), server does not do lazy write.
Performance decreased.

1 - (DEFAULT) WRITE-THRU is NOT set on opens (or writes), server does lazy write.
Performance increased.

The documentation correctly states that the DEFAULT is 1, but it misleadingly
implies that the default (1) means "turn on WRITE-THRU." LANMAN does not turn on
WRITE-THRU by default.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 2.10a 2.20
