KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft TrueType Font Pack II 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the printer driver for the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4 printer,
you cannot print sample font pages from the Font Assistant. When you try to
print a sample page for a font from the Font Assistant, the page contains the
following information:

 - The header, which contains font-specific information (such as the font name,
   copyright information, file size, and version).

 - The body of the page, which contains five lines of sample text displaying the
   point sizes 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60.

If you use the LaserJet 4 printer driver version 31.01.03, the text in the header
is garbled and the sample lines are truncated, except for the 60- point font
sample, which prints correctly.

If you use the LaserJet 4 printer driver version 31.01.08, only the 60- point
font sample prints. All other sample page text is missing.

When the font list is printed using the Font Assistant and the LaserJet 4 driver
version 31.v1.08, the following characters may print as a blank space:

   m w k h M W K H

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the HP LaserJet III printer driver. This is the
only workaround available at this time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The HP LaserJet 4 driver version 31.v1.35 causes similar problems with Microsoft
Word versions 2.0 and 6.0 for Windows and Microsoft Publisher.
