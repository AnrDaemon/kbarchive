PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

SpaceManager is a third-party disk utility that works with DoubleSpace to do the
following:

 - Increase the actual compression ratio (ACR)

 - Automatically mount DoubleSpace-compressed floppy disks

 - Make DoubleSpace-compressed removable media disk usable by any computer using
   MS-DOS 3.31 or later

To use SpaceManager with MS-DOS 6.2 DoubleSpace, you need to obtain version 1.53
from Verisoft.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SpaceManager makes changes to the AUTOEXEC.BAT and SYSTEM.INI files. These
changes are explained below and can be remarked out (using the REM command)
without causing any problems.

SpaceManager uses the following files:

     Filename          Function
   -------------------------------------------------------------

   SELECTC.BAT       This batch file is used to select the level
                     of compression for different types of files.

   SMOUNT.EXE        This file is used to automatically mount
                     removable media disks.

   FORTUNE.EXE       This file is used to estimate free disk
                     space.

Sample AUTOEXEC.BAT File
------------------------

set spaceman=c:\spaceman\ 
call c:\spaceman\selectc /b
c:\spaceman\smount /b
c:\spaceman\fortune /b

NOTE: The /B parameter causes the program to look in the SPACEMAN.INI file for
the load=1 line, which indicates that command should run.

Changes Made to the [386enh] Section of the SYSTEM.INI File
-----------------------------------------------------------

SpaceManager adds "device=c:\spaceman\spaceman.386" to the [386enh] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file. This file is a Windows-based virtual compression manager.
