The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a

SUMMARY
=======

Memo fields provide a powerful way to implement text merges in FoxPro. The
information below provides the code to print the contents of memo fields
containing the text for a text merge.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In this example, the memo field contains the text to be merged with the text
merge components. The page spacing (top, bottom, and side margins) is controlled
within the memo field. A sample memo field will appear much like this:

      <<DATE()>>

      <<ALLTRIM(PROPER(CONTACT))>>
      <<ALLTRIM(PROPER(COMPANY))>>
      <<ALLTRIM(PROPER(ADDRESS))>>
      <<ALLTRIM(PROPER(CITY))>>, <<ALLTRIM(STATE)>> <<ALLTRIM(ZIP)>>

      Dear <<ALLTRIM(PROPER(CONTACT))>>:

      This area includes the body of a letter to be sent to the contact.

      Sincerely,

      Author's name

The following code prints the letter from the memo field shown above. The text
merge components (the fields and such) are in the SAMPLE\DBFS subdirectory of
FoxPro for MS-DOS and the SAMPLE\ORGANIZE\DBFS subdirectory of FoxPro for
Windows.

     CLEAR
     SET PRINTER ON
     SET TEXTMERGE ON                && enable evaluation of components
     SET TALK OFF                    && prevents printing of commands
     SET TEXTMERGE DELIMITERS TO     && set default delimiters
     SET MEMOWIDTH TO 80             && sets memo width for 80 columns
     USE Clients
     SCAN                            && forces top-down processing
      FOR J=1 TO MEMLINES(<memo>)    && processes each line in memo field
         X="\"+MLINE(<name of memo field>,J)
         &X                          && macro substitution
      ENDFOR
     ENDSCAN

NOTE: If the print job doesn't print until you quit FoxPro, see the following
