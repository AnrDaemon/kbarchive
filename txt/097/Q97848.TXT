======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Irwin Magnetic Systems' EZTape for MS-DOS, version 2.22 or version
3.1, on a DoubleSpace-compressed drive, the following problems may occur:

 - EZTape may stop responding (hang) when performing a backup or restore on the
   DoubleSpace-compressed drive.

-or-

 - EZTape may display one of the following error messages when performing a
   backup or restore on a compressed drive:

    - Run-time error R6001 null pointer assignment

    - EMM386 exception error #12, enter to reboot computer

CAUSE
=====

EZTape for MS-DOS version 2.22 or 3.1 may identify a DoubleSpace- compressed
drive as a nonstandard drive and may require that the DOSONLY environment
variable is set before you can begin an action ona compressed drive.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set the MS-DOS environment variable to DOSONLY=1
before you use EZTape for MS-DOS.

To do this, using MS-DOS Editor (or another ASCII text editor), insert the
following statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   " SET DOSONLY=1 " (without the quotation marks)

Setting the DOSONLY environment variable forces EZTape for MS-DOS to use standard
MS-DOS system calls to access the drive. You must reboot your computer for this
change to take effect.

NOTE: The DOSONLY environment variable should not be necessary for use on
uncompressed drives.
