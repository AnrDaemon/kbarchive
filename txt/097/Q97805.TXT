SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to install HPPCL third-party scalable font support on a
Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet III printer (using the HPPCL5MS.DRV printer
driver), you may receive a general protection (GP) fault in UNIDRV.DLL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the PFM and PCM files generated
by the PCL soft font installer (FINSTALL.DLL), which most third-party developers
use to build the PCM/PFM files they distribute with their products. This problem
does not occur if PFM/PCM files are built to the specifications described in the
Windows 3.1 Device Driver Development Kit (DDK).

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FINSTALL.DLL. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here as it becomes available.
