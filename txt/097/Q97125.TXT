The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1992 and 1993 Editions

SUMMARY
=======

After the end of the animation sequence "Ptolemaic System," your cursor may
change from the normal arrow pointing tool to a miniature mouse icon, like the
mouse icon in Control Panel.

In Bookshelf 1992, the pointer remains an icon after this happens. In Bookshelf
1993, the pointer turns back into a normal pointer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
