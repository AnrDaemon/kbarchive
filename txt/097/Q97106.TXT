The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the command for PC-KWIK has a leading at sign (@) in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file,
Setup does not detect the disk cache and therefore cannot remark it out before
adding the command for SMARTDrive (SMARTDRV.EXE).

Microsoft does not recommend running two disk caches; be sure to disable one
before you run Setup. To disable PC-KWIK, edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file with an
ASCII text editor, such as MS-DOS Editor, and add the remark statement (REM) in
front of the command for PC-KWIK. For example:

   rem @call c:\pckwik\superon

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PC-KWIK version 4.21 installation program adds the following line to the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   @call c:\pckwik\superon

Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 6.20 pckwik pc kwik quick
