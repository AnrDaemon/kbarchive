SUMMARY
=======

If you want to use extended characters in scripts for version 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail Remote for Windows, you must use a Windows text editor (for example,
NOTEPAD.EXE) to enter ANSI characters.

If you use a Microsoft MS-DOS editor, the characters are entered with the wrong
code page and do not appear properly. Also, the scripts might not work
correctly.
