TITLE   :PC WRmt: System Selector Does Not Validate Its Results
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Mail System Selector provided with Microsoft Mail Remote version
3.2 for Windows does not delete extended command entries if you interrupt and
restart the application.

CAUSE
=====

The Selector can report an incorrect driver as the current driver. When Mail
starts, various error messages appear that depend on the previous driver and on
the new driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have difficulty starting Mail Remote for Windows immediately after you
change Mail drivers, run the Selector program. Select the last driver you chose
more than once. This procedure resolves the problem for some drivers.

Running the Selector program a second time and choosing the driver multiple times
appears to correct the problem, even though remote extended commands remain in
the MSMAIL.INI file.

Because Mail supports various drivers, no single method is available to resolve
this problem. However, for certain drivers, using the Selector utility to choose
the new driver repeatedly (without choosing an alternate driver between choices)
can resolve some problems.
