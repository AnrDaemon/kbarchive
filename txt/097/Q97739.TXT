The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

When you run MemMaker on a computer running SuperStor Pro, the system may
provide an error messages about an illegal read to a device and then prompt you
with an "Abort, Retry, Fail?" message, or you may receive the "Bad or missing
command interpreter" error message.

To prevent this problem, add *SSTORDRV and *DEVSWAP to the MEMMAKER.INF file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have already run MemMaker and your machine stops responding (hangs) at
the "Abort, Retry, Fail?" prompt, do the following:

1. Restart your computer.

2. Type "memmaker /undo" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command
   prompt and then press ENTER.

3. Edit your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files with MS-DOS Editor. If MemMaker
   was unable to undo its changes, remove the MemMaker commands (such as
   CHKSTATE.SYS, SIZER.EXE, and MEMMAKER.EXE /SESSION) and save the files.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 reboot 6.20
