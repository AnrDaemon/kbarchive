-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for the Macintosh, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a Gravis MouseStick is connected to an Apple Adjustable Keyboard when you
start your computer. The MouseStick continues to control the mouse pointer after
opening Flight Simulator.

You can still use the MouseStick to control the plane by clicking Mouse As Yoke
from the Edit menu.

Normally, when you have a Gravis MouseStick connected to your Macintosh computer,
the MouseStick controls your mouse pointer. However, once you open Flight
Simulator, the MouseStick stops controlling the mouse pointer and only controls
your ailerons and elevators, without turning the Mouse As Yoke command on. This
allows you to continue using your mouse to control the mouse pointer, while
flying using the MouseStick.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem can also be corrected by restarting the Macintosh with the Gravis
MouseStick connected to an Apple Standard or Extended Keyboard.
