SYMPTOMS
========

When starting the Microsoft Windows NT File Manager, you may encounter multiple
identical drive icons in File Manager.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when two SCSI devices on the same SCSI adapter are set to
the same ID. For example:

   SCSI Hard Drive SCSI 0
   SCSI CD ROM     SCSI 0

WORKAROUND
==========

Setting each SCSI device to a unique ID resolves this problem.

The SCSI ID address is usually set through dip switch blocks or jumper blocks,
depending on the device. The SCSI bus must be terminated correctly to ensure
proper operation. The first and last physical SCSI devices on the SCSI cable
must have terminators installed. All other devices on the SCSI cable between the
first and last devices must have terminators removed.

SCSI Host Adapter address ID is set by default to 7.
SCSI hard drive ID should be set by default to 0 or 1.
