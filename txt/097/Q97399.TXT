SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the implementation of an owner-drawn combo box and list
box that use the drive and folder icons from the Microsoft Windows version 3.1
Software Development Kit (SDK).

DDLIST utilizes the unused bitmaps that are included in the Microsoft Windows
version 3.1 Software Development Kit (SDK) SAMPLES\COMMDLG directory for the
File Open and File Save dialog boxes. DDLIST implements the drives combo box and
the directory list box as an interrelated pair in a dialog box, fully utilizing
the drive type and folder icons available with the Windows SDK. All the bitmaps
are loaded separately and maintained in two global HBITMAP arrays. The code to
draw the combo box and list box items references these arrays.
