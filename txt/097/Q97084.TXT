TITLE   :PROFS: Gateway Unable to Mail to HP Desk System
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.1,3.2,3.3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Normally, the process of sending mail from the Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS
to a Hewlett-Packard Desk (HP Desk) user is accomplished by customizing the VM
system and using the nickname file.

However, when Mail messages are sent to HP Desk through the PROFS gateway, HP
Desk rejects the messages because the full name of the recipient is not in the
TO: field, as shown below.

Messages sent to HP Desk from PROFS using the nickname file (the full name is in
the comment field in the nickname file)

   TO:Nickname --VMID Full name

Messages sent to HP Desk from Microsoft Mail using the PROFS gateway

   TO:Nickname --VMID

Because gateway addressing does not take the full name from the comment field of
the nickname file, HP Desk is unable to properly route the message to the HP
Desk user.

RESOLUTION
==========

None currently available.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Host Access for the
Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision versions 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
