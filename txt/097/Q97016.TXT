KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you start Microsoft Windows in 386 enhanced mode after you upgrade to MS-
DOS, you may receive the following error message:

   EMM386: Unable to start enhanced mode Windows due to invalid path
   specification for EMM386

CAUSE
=====

This error can be caused by the following:

 - A possible incompatibility between Windows, EMM386.EXE version 4.45, and
   VSafe.

   For more information, type "help vsafe" (without the quotation marks) at the
   MS-DOS command prompt, press ENTER, and then choose Note.

 - The presence of MS-DOS CHKLIST.MS (or older Central Point CHKLIST.CPS) check
   list files in your Windows or MS-DOS directory.

 - With MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade, running Microsoft Anti-Virus (MSAV) before running
   MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up installation, and loading the MS-DOS VSafe program.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are running the MS-DOS version of VSafe (not Central Point VSafe or PC
Tools Vdefend), you should first add the /Y parameter (along with the path to
EMM386.EXE) to the DEVICE command for EMM386.EXE in your CONFIG.SYS file. For
example, add the following:

      device=c:\dos\emm386.exe noems /y=c:\dos\emm386.exe

If you are running MS-DOS 6.0, work around this problem as follows:

 - Unload VSafe by typing "vsafe /u" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
   command prompt, or change the command for VSafe in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file so
   that it has the path to the DOS directory (for example, C:\DOS\VSAFE.COM) and
   then restart your computer.

-or-

 - Delete the CHKLIST.MS files (and any CHKLIST.CPS files) from the Windows or
   \DOS directories.

-or-

 - Use the Windows version of EMM386.EXE.

If the problem occurred when you upgraded to MS-DOS 6.2, try the following:

 - Run MSAV again after upgrading.

-or-

 - Delete the CHKLIST.MS file from your Windows or MS-DOS directory.

-or-

 - Unload Vsafe before running Windows.
