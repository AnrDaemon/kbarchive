SUMMARY
=======

By default, when you start Word, it opens a new document based on the Normal
template (Normal.dot). You can, however, specify starting Word and opening a new
document based on an alternative template by using a command-line switch.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To specify an alternative template using a command-line switch, follow these
steps:

1. Create a shortcut for Word.

2. Right-click the shortcut. Click Properties.

3. Click the Shortcut tab and change the Target line to:

   c:\<WordFolder>\winword.exe /t<templatename>

   where <WordFolder> is the path to the Winword.exe program, and
   <templatename> is the full path to the template. If the path or the
   template file name uses a long file name, enclose the path and template name
   in quotation marks. Make sure there is no space between the /t switch and
   <templatename>.
