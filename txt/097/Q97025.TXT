TITLE   :PC WRmt: Subject-Line Length Limited to 40 Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, when you use the Get
Headers command to retrieve mail message headers, Mail truncates the Subject
line of each message to 40 characters. This behavior leaves the Subject
description incomplete when the message contains a long Subject. This behavior
does not depend on the size of the Subject column in the Headers dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a design limitation in EXTERNAL.EXE, which processes
only 40 characters for the Subject of each message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in EXTERNAL.EXE included with
versions 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.2 of Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
