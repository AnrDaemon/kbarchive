SUMMARY
=======

The error message "Fdisk Unsuccessful" sometimes appears when you try to install
OS/2 1.3 on a COMPAQ Prosignia with a 550 MB SCSI-2 hard disk.

The Prosignia line requires a special .BID file, which COMPAQ supplies. If it is
not on the disks supplied with the computer, order it from COMPAQ. Make a copy
of your install A disk, delete all the .BID files on it, put the new COMPAQ .BID
file on the disk, and rename it BOOTBID.BID. Install OS/2 again.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 2.10a 2.20
