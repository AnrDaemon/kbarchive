-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you enter printer commands in the Modify dialog box for the Generic/Text
Only printer driver (TTY.DRV), the null character (ASCII 0), entered by pressing
CTRL+SHIFT+@ (At sign), is incorrectly sent to the printer as ASCII character
255. However, when the null character is entered in the Character dialog box to
substitute it for another character, it is sent correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The null character is required by many printers in their escape sequence
commands. The null character cannot be entered in a document in most
Windows-based applications.

WORKAROUND
==========

As a workaround, substitute the null character for an unused character in the
Characters dialog box and use that character in an embedded escape sequence in
the application.

For example, to send "ESC X (0)" (in ASCII, 27 120 0) from Microsoft Windows
Write and replace character 255, do the following:

1. In the Characters dialog box of the Generic/Text Only driver, choose
   character 255 in the On Screen box and press CTRL+SHIFT+@ in the On Printer
   box.

2. In Write, enter the escape sequence as "ESC X (255)" (without the quotation
   marks). The key combination is ALT+027 on the numeric keypad X ALT+0255 on
   the numeric keypad.
