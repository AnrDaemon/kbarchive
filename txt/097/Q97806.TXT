TITLE   :DoubleSpace Maintenance Program Fails to Modify DBLSPACE.INI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

If a network drive is mapped over the host drive letter and you attempt to change
the "Last drive reserved for DoubleSpace's use:" setting, the DoubleSpace
maintenance program does not change the LastDrive= line in the DBLSPACE.INI
file, and does not indicate that the operation failed.

CAUSE
=====

The DoubleSpace maintenance program cannot change the DBLSPACE.INI file on the
host drive when a network drive is mapped over its drive letter.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this situation, disconnect or log off from the network drive and
run the DoubleSpace maintenance program to change the "Last drive reserved for
DoubleSpace's use:" setting.

Additional query words: 6.00 double space manager dblspace 6.20
