TITLE   :LAN Manager Limits Number of ACLs on a FAT Partition

SUMMARY
=======

With LAN Manager 1.01, there is a limit on the number of ACLs which can be
created on a FAT partition. LAN Manager 2.x addresses this problem by providing
HPFS386 and ACLs stored in the file system, rather than in NET.ACC, but you can
encounter the LAN Manager 1.x limit with non-HPFS386 ACLs in version 2.x also.


You can work around this by using default (drive) permissions to set up the most
common access permissions, then using ACLs only for exceptions to these default
permissions. Drive permissions are not available for HPFS386 drives.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 2.10a 2.20
