 - Microsoft Mail Remote, Windows Client, version 3.2

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail Remote version 3.2 for Windows, you can create a log file for
each modem session to assist in troubleshooting. This file is called SESSION.LOG
and is created in the <Windows_directory>\MSMAIL\MSRMT directory (by
default, C:\WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT).

Microsoft Mail overwrites this file each session. If you want to build a larger
log file to troubleshoot patterns of modem trouble over a longer period of time,
you must save the file under a different name after each session.

Microsoft Mail does not provide an option to append information to the previous
SESSION.LOG file.


Additional query words: 3.20
