The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Symantec's Norton Desktop for Windows or Central Point Software's PC
Tools for Windows, your DoubleSpace-compressed Bernoulli drive(s) may unmount
when you start Windows or when you choose to refresh the display. Choosing the
Bernoulli drive letter in File Manager shows one file called READTHIS.TXT. If
opened, the file states:

   This disk has been compressed by MS-DOS DBLSPACE.
   To make this disks contents accessible change to the
   drive and type: DBLSPACE /MOUNT

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you use older Bernoulli drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, update your Bernoulli drivers to version 1.21 or
later.

Norton Desktop for Windows, PC Tools for Windows, and Bernoulli drives are
manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied
or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
