The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft CodeView displays the following message when it first starts up:

   CV1053 Warning: TOOLS.INI not found

CAUSE
=====

Unlike Microsoft Programmer's WorkBench (PWB), CodeView searches for the
TOOLS.INI file in only the first directory listed in the INIT environment
variable. If TOOLS.INI is not in this directory, CodeView generates the warning
above.

RESOLUTION
==========

Because CodeView does not always require the TOOLS.INI file, you can typically
ignore this warning. If you have a TOOLS.INI file, modify your MS-DOS INIT
environment variable to specify only the directory that contains the file.

If you have more than one TOOLS.INI file that you want PWB to load, you can avoid
this warning by concatenating distinctly named sections from the files into one
TOOLS.INI file. Each section begins with the section name in square brackets,
such as [pwb-main]. You can use a text editor such s PWB or MS-DOS EDIT to
create this file. Then place the resulting file into the one directory specified
in the INIT environment variable.
