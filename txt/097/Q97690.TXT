SUMMARY
=======

Compaq MS-DOS version 5.00a includes a command called RUNHI, which replaces both
the DEVICEHIGH and LOADHIGH (LH) commands. RUNHI works in both the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and provides more control over memory location where
programs load than does DEVICEHIGH or LOADHIGH.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the following exceptions, RUNHI is compatible with MS-DOS 6:

 - DoubleSpace can't be loaded high with RUNHI

 - MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup doesn't recognize lines in CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT
   files that start with RUNHI. As a result, you may end up with duplicate load
   commands for drivers in those files after Setup has modified those files.

   For example, if you have the line RUNHI MOUSE.COM in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file,
   Setup finds that you have a mouse driver loaded and tries to update it, but
   Setup doesn't find the line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file where it is loaded. As a
   result, it adds C:\DOS\MOUSE to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The RUNHI MOUSE.COM
   command is not modified.
