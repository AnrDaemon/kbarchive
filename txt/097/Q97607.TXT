 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you run MemMaker if there is
more than one MEMMAKER.STS file on your hard drive:

   Invalid Session ID

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Delete all the MEMMAKER.STS files.

2. Remove any MemMaker commands from the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

3. Run MemMaker again.

If you are using disk compression, you may need to run MemMaker with the /SWAP
parameter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Invalid Session ID" error message means the identifier that is passed to
MEMMAKER, CHKSTATE, or SIZER is not the same as the identifier in the
MEMMAKER.STS file. An "Invalid Session ID" indicates that an incorrect .STS file
is being found.
