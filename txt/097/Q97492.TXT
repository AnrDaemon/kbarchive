SUMMARY
=======

COMNDIS.COM is a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program that helps keep your
workstation from hanging during background network operations by preventing
multiple processes from accessing the adapter card while the card is handling an
MS-DOS command. COMNDIS.COM is on the LAN Manager 2.2 installation disks in the
LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG subdirectory.

COMNDIS.COM should be the last thing you load in AUTOEXEC.BAT, and you must start
it before any LAN Manager commands except NETBIND are issued. Start it with a
command in AUTOEXEC.BAT that you insert after the NETBIND command (if you are
using NETBIND) but before any other LAN Manager commands. Use this form

   comndis x

where x is the interrupt number for the LAN Manager adapter. For example, if your
card is set at IRQ 5, the command would be:

   comndis 5

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 2.10a 2.20
