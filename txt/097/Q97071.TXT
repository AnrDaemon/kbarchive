TITLE   :PC WRmt: Keyboard Problems in Select Headers Dialog Box
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, interacting with the
headers dialog box without a mouse can be awkward. For remote users, this can
occur frequently.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the ALT key. Use ALT+R to retrieve mail and ALT+D to delete mail.

If you press only the ALT key and release it, Mail interprets this as ALT+SPACE
BAR. When this happens, you must press the ESC key to regain control.
Unfortunately, the ESC key not only reverses the SPACE BAR keypress, it also
closes the dialog box without saving any retrieve or delete operations you
entered previously.

This behavior is not standard for a Microsoft Windows application because ESC
should reverse one level of command action, not two levels.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
