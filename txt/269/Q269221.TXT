SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a user and an alias to the user in a group, and then create an
alias from that alias, the second alias does not follow the same deletion rules
as the first alias. When you delete the user, the first alias is deleted at the
same time. However, the second alias is not deleted. When you click the second
alias object, the following error message appears:

   The Object member = Member=aliasname,list=listname,ou=OU,dc=domain,dc=dom is
   not available: 32

If the alias object is deleted, the second alias object is deleted automatically.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, manually delete the second alias.
