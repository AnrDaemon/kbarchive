TITLE   :Column Headings Change When You Modify Canned Queries

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you modify the default queries that exist for a site to include multiple
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes, the column headings for each
column may change to reflect the class name and attribute name.

CAUSE
=====

The default queries that are included with Systems Management Server (SMS) use
only a single WMI class. Therefore, they show only the class attribute in the
column headings. If you add an attribute from a different WMI class to the
query, the headings change to reflect the WMI class name and the attribute
because you are using multiple classes in the query. Modifying the query to
enumerate the attributes from a single WMI class shows only the attribute name
in the heading. You cannot change this behavior.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
