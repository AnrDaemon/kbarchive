SUMMARY
=======

The following documentation on the Service ACL Editor (SVCACLS.EXE) is included
in the Windows 2000 Resource Kit Tools Help file. However, the SVCACLS.exe file
is not included on the Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kits' CD-ROM.

   Svcacls.exe: Service ACL Editor

   This command-line tool sets access control lists (ACLs) on service objects,
   enabling administrators to delegate control of services.

   To initially use Service ACL Editor, you must have Administrator privileges,
   although someone with Administrator privileges can use the tool to grant
   someone without Administrator privileges permission to use the tool. Delete,
   Read Control, and Write discretionary access control are required to modify
   discretionary access control lists (DACLs) for services. The DACL (usually
   referred to simply as ACL) determines the permissions on an object. To change
   a DACL, a permission called WRITE_DAC is required.

   Service ACL Editor runs only on x86-based computers running Windows 2000 or
   Windows NT version 4.0.

   Caution
   Do not remove permissions on any service for Administrators or System. If you
   do, you might have to reinstall Windows 2000 to regain control over the
   service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Svcacls.exe utility was pulled from the Resource Kit CD-ROM at the last
minute. Unfortunately the documentation for this utility was inadvertently left
behind.

This utility was pulled because the same functionality is available in the
SUBINACL tool. Additional information on the SUBINACL tool is available in the
Resource Kit Tools Help file.
