TITLE   :PRB: SP_SetAppRole in RDO Causes Error Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbRDO kbGrpDSVBDB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the sp_SetAppRole stored procedure in Remote Data Objects (RDO) to
set the application role for the connection, Microsoft SQL Server returns the
following error message:

   40002
   37000: [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server] Application roles can
   only be activated at the ad hoc level.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs because a temporary stored procedure has been created
to run the query.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you use the rdExecDirect option, RDO uses the SQLExecDirect ODBC API function
to run the query because no temporary stored procedure is created.

To resolve the problem, add rdExecDirect option to the Execute method call as
follows:

   rdoConnection.Execute "sp_SetAppRole 'RoleName', 'Password'", rdExecDirect

Additional query words: 40002 37000
