TITLE   :PRB: Tabbed Dialog Control Has Different Behavior on Non-VB Form
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbActiveX kbCOMt kbCtrl kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When placing the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control on a non-Visual Basic form, the
design-time behavior is different than it is when the control is placed on a
Visual Basic Form. Specifically, when a tab is clicked, any child controls on
other tabs are still visible.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control uses a private
Visual Basic specific interface, IVBGetControl, to iterate through all the child
controls on the form. The IVBGetControl interface is not documented and it is
not available in containers other than Visual Basic.

RESOLUTION
==========

Currently, there is no solution to using the same design time features of the
Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control outside of a Visual Basic form.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
