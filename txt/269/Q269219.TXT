TITLE   :TAMA Cannot Create Objects Directly Under Active Directory MA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The follow error message is generated in the operator's log when running the
Together Administration Management Agent (TAMA) program to populate Active
Directory:

   ERROR 14083: DB5_RC_COULD_NOT_SET_STR_OBJ_CLASS

   >> DEBUG[A connector cannot be created directly under the AD MA.]: [A
   connector cannot be created directly under the AD MA.]
   >> DEBUG[It must be created under an NC connector:
   CN=x,NC=abc.com,MA=abc,...]: [It must be created under an NC connector:
   CN=x,NC=abc.com,MA=abc,...]
   0028-META MODIFICATION FAILED[14083]: cn=Catarina
   Dzierzanowski,ou=Accounting,ou=metaverse,dc=juggernaut,dc=microsoft,dc=com

CAUSE
=====

You must specify a location under the Active Directory Management Agent where
TAMA will create connectors for the metaverse objects. The user interface, under
"Location Under the MA", states that this parameter is optional in general,
however, it is not optional for the Active Directory Management Agent.

RESOLUTION
==========

To specifiy a location, follow these steps:

1. Double-click Together Administrator Management Agent.

2. Double-click the resource that you are using for the provisioning of Active
   Directory.

3. In "Location Under the MA", select a naming-context container connector under
   the Active Directory Management Agent, such as company.com, or an area deeper
   in the tree, such as the Users container.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
