TITLE   :SMS Provider May Not Recognize DMTF Dates
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SMS provider does not recognize Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF)
dates that are generated by the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Open
Database Connectivity (ODBC) adapter.

CAUSE
=====

All dates and times in WMI use the format designed by the DMTF. When the WMI
ODBC driver is presented with a SQL query that uses a DATETIME field in the
"where" clause, such as

   SELECT SMS_R_System.Name FROM "root\SMS\site_102".SMS_R_System SMS_R_System
   WHERE (SMS_R_System.AgentTime>{ts '2000-06-01 00:00:00.000000'})

it converts the query to WMI Query Language (WQL) format with the DATETIME field
in DMTF format:

   SELECT Name FROM SMS_R_System
   WHERE AgentTime > 2000601000000.000000+000"

This WQL query does not work in the SMS provider for two reasons:

 - Literal values compared against SMS_R_System.AgentTime are not treated as
   time values.

 - The provider does not recognize the "+000" time format; it recognized only
   the "+***" format.

RESOLUTION
==========

Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
