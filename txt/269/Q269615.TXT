TITLE   :SMS: Mixed Languages in SMS 2.0 Sites That Share a Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When multiple Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 sites share the same
domain, and Microsoft Windows NT Logon Installation or Windows NT Logon
Discovery is enabled, if the sites are installed with different languages, for
example, U.S. English and French, the senior site updates the logon points. All
subsequent client installations are written in the language of the senior site.
This behavior is expected and occurs because the senior site maintains the logon
points.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In SMS, the International Client Pack (ICP) allows you to install clients with
different languages within SMS, and maintain separate language components for
multiple languages. When you install an ICP to all sites within a domain, it
adds additional language support to the product. During installation, the ICP
prompts the client components to perform a language evaluation based on the
client's regional settings.

ICPs are specific to each service pack revision. For example, the ICP for an SMS
Service Pack 1 (SP1) site does not function correctly in an SMS Service Pack 2
(SP2) site. In addition, components from all sites must be at the same software
revision level for the ICP to function. Any "hot fixes" applied to one site must
be applied to all sites.
