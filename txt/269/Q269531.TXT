SUMMARY
=======

When troubleshooting error messages that are difficult to reproduce, it may be
helpful to enable fault logging to record the errors as they occur.

By enabling fault logging in the registry, Windows 95 logs general protection
faults, and invalid page faults to the Faultlog.txt file.

To enable fault logging, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click OK.

2. Create a registry key under the following location, and name it "Fault"
   (without the quotation marks):

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion

3. Create a Logfile string value in the Fault key with a value data of
   "C:\Windows\Faultlog.txt".

   Logging takes effect immediately, and does not require that you restart the
   computer. Logging remains in effect until you delete the Fault registry key.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 includes a version of Drwatson.exe, which
offers a more detailed method of logging fault errors to the Faultlog.txt file.
In addition, Windows 98 includes an updated version of Drwatson.exe, which
includes the ability to take a snapshot of the system when a problem occurs with
a program.
