   Q257740 PC DirSync: Global Reset for Microsoft Mail

To remove the Exchange Server computer as a requestor and make the Exchange
Server computer the dirsync server:

1. Demote the old MS Mail dirsync server to a requestor.

   NOTE: If you do not have a dirsync server for your MS Mail organization, you
   can skip step 1.

   To demote the old MS Mail dirsync server to a requestor:

   a. Start the MS Mail Administrator program, choose Config, choose Dir-Sync,
      choose Options, and then choose No. When a warning message is displayed,
      choose Yes.

      IMPORTANT: This step deletes the Srvconf.glb and Msttrans.glb files from
      the server. After you complete this step, you must perform all of the
      following steps in steps 1 and 2.

   b. Reset the Reqconf.glb file on the dirsync server by running the following
      command:

   listds admin -p(password) -dm -r -z

   c. Choose Config, choose Dir-Sync, choose Requestor, choose Registration, and
      then choose the network name of the shadow postoffice and the postoffice
      name of the shadow postoffice.

   d. Choose Config, choose Dir-Sync, choose Requestor, and then choose Types to
      reset the types of names that are propagated by dirsync.

      IMPORTANT: This step is only necessary if gateways are installed and
      gateway names are included in dirsync.

   e. Choose Config, choose Dir-Sync, choose Requestor, and then choose Export
      to send the list to the other postoffices.

   f. Replace the Control.glb file with a copy of the Control.glb file from
      another requestor.

2. On each MS Mail requestor postoffice:

   a. Reset the Reqconf.glb file by running the following command:

   listds admin -p(password) -dm -r -z

   b. Verify that the Reqconf.glb file is reset properly by running the
      following command:

   listds admin -p(password) -dm -r

      The ReqSync and SrvSync numbers should both be zero (0).

   c. Choose Config, choose Dir-Sync, choose Requestor, and then choose Types to
      reset the types of names that are propagated by dirsync.

      IMPORTANT: This step is only necessary if gateways are installed and
      gateway names are included in dirsync.

      If you use an older version of the Listds utility, the name of the dirsync
      server is reset as well. If this occurs, reregister the dirsync server by
      choosing Config, choosing Dir-Sync, choosing Requestor, and then choosing
      Registration.

   d. Choose Config, choose Dir-Sync, choose Requestor, and then choose Export
      to send the list to the other postoffices. After you perform these steps,
      all the dirsync files are reset. Wait for Dispatch to complete the next
      dirsync cycle, and then review the log files to make sure that everything
      is working properly.

3. Remove the Exchange Server computer as a requestor:

   a. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program.

   b. Click the Connections object.

   c. Click the dirsync server object, and then press the DELETE key.

4. Make the Exchange Server computer the dirsync server:

   a. Click the Connections object.

   b. On the File menu, click New, click Other, and then click Dirsync Server.

   c. Give the dirsync server object a name.

   d. Click Dirsync Admin, and then click an administrator account.

   e. Click Forward Dirsync Messages to Admin.

   f. Click the Schedule tab, and then click "T2 time".

   g. Click OK.

5. Create requestor objects:

   a. On the File menu, click New, click Other, and then click Remote Dirsync
      Requestor.

   b. A list of all of the MS Mail postoffices is displayed. Click the first
      postoffice in the list.

   c. Click OK.

   d. Give the requestor object a name.

   e. Click Import Container, and then click the container in which you want MS
      Mail names to appear.

   f. Click Export, and then select the containers that you want to participate
      in dirsync.

   g. Click the General tab, and then click to select the Export On Next Cycle
      check box.

6. Repeat step 5 for each MS Mail postoffice.

7. Either allow dirsync to run overnight, or perform a manual dirsync.
