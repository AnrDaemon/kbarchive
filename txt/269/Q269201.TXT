SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a query in Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0, the Values box
in the query builder may be empty. This may occur if the hotfix for Q245648 is
installed, and there is either a very large value (approximately 9,500; the
actual number varies based on available memory) or a value of 0 (a value of 0
requests that all records be returned) specified in:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\AdminUI\QueryBuilder\ValueLimit

The hotfix for Q245648 (both for Service Pack 1 and Service Pack 2) allows for
more than 2,000 records to be listed in the query builder criteria section. For
additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   First 2000 Records

CAUSE
=====

The SMS provider runs out of memory while it is caching a large result set.

Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

If you are running Microsoft Windows NT or Microsoft Windows 2000, you should
also update your Emergency Repair Disk (ERD) after completing this procedure.

To work around this problem, use a lower value in:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\AdminUI\QueryBuilder\ValueLimit

Use a value such that the records are displayed (the actual number varies based
on available memory).

NOTE: If ValueLimit does not exist, you can create it (Reg_DWORD).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 3.
