SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to troubleshoot video display issues in the programs
that are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To troubleshoot video display issues in the programs listed at the the beginning
of this article, use the following methods.

Configure Your Display Settings
-------------------------------

The programs listed at the beginning of this article cannot run properly if your
video adapter is configured to use a 16 color palette. Make sure that your video
adapter is configured to use a 256 color palette as well as a screen resolution
of 640 x 480 pixels. To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab.

4. In the Colors or Color Palette box, click 256 Colors.

5. Move the "Screen area" slider to the "640 by 480 pixels" position.

6. Click OK. If you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

Use the Windows Taskbar to Switch Between Programs
--------------------------------------------------

When you switch to another program and then press ALT+TAB or CTRL+ESC to switch
back to one of the programs listed at the beginning of this article, colors on
the screen may be scrambled.

To prevent this issue from occurring, click the button on the Windows taskbar for
your Magic School Bus program to switch back to the program. Do not press
ALT+TAB or CTRL+ESC to switch back to the program.

If the issue continues to occur, quit all programs that are running on the
computer, close all open windows, and then restart the program.

Obtain and Install an Updated Video Driver
------------------------------------------

If the screen turns black, colors are distorted, or graphic objects or text are
not redrawn correctly, you may need to contact your hardware manufacturer to
inquire about how to obtain and install the latest version of the video driver
for your video adapter.
