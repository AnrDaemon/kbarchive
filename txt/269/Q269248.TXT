TITLE   :XADM: Exchange Installation Stops with Error ID C103798a
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Exchange Server 5.5 or an Exchange Server 5.5
service pack on a Hewlett-Packard computer, Setup may stop and the following
error message may appear:

   Processing file path\server.ins at or near line 153.
   An internal component has failed.
   Id No. C103798a

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you attempt to install Exchange Server 5.5 or an
Exchange service pack on a Hewlett-Packard computer that is running Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP) service. SNMP locks open the PREf009a.dat
file or the PREF009f.dat file and stops the installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, stop the SNMP service before you install Exchange
Server 5.5 or an Exchange Server 5.5 service pack, and then restart the SNMP
service after the installation is complete.
