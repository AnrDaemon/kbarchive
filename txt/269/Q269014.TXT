SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to move the Edb.chk file on a Microsoft Cluster.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Edb.chk files are located in the information store and Directory Working
paths. If you use Exchange Performance Optimizer to move your Exchange Server
databases and log files to a different location, these paths are not changed.
The following article advises you to use the Exchange Administrator program to
change these paths.

   Q196332 Edb.chk Does Not Move During Performance Optimization

However, if you try to do this on a Microsoft Cluster server, you receive the
following message:

   The Administrator program has detected that this is a clustered Exchange
   Server. When running on a cluster, Server Paths cannot be modified using the
   Administrator program. Please use the Microsoft Exchange Optimizer to modify
   these parameters.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

The only way to change these paths is to use Registry Editor (Regedt32) and
follow these steps:

1. Stop all Exchange Server services.

2. Move the Edb.chk file from the C:\Exchsrvr\Dsadata folder to its new
   location.

3. Click Start, click Run, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and
   then press Enter.

4. Locate and click the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS\Parameters\DSA
   Working Directory

5. Change the path to reflect the new location of Directory Edb.chk.

6. Move the Edb.chk file from the C:\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata folder to its new
   location.

7. Click Start, click Run, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and
   then press Enter.

8. Locate and click the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem\Working
   Directory

9. Change the path to reflect the new location of the Edb.chk file.

10. Start all Exchange services.
