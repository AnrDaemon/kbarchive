The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Conferencing Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the different behavior that occurs if you use Microsoft
Outlook 2000 to change resources and providers in an online conference that is
currently running.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Data Conference Service
-----------------------

 - If you use Outlook 2000 to change a Data Conference Service resource, if the
   new or updated conference resource does not contain a Data Conference
   Technology Provider (CTP) but the previous resource did, current participants
   are disconnected from the data portion of the conference.

 - If you add a Data CTP to the new resource, participants must rejoin to
   participate in the data conference.

Video Conference Service
------------------------

 - If you use Outlook 2000 to change a Video Conference Service resource, if the
   new or updated conference resource does not contain a Video CTP but the
   previous resource did, new clients cannot participate in the audio/video
   conference.

 - If you add a Video CTP to the new resource, participants must rejoin to
   participate in the audio/video conference.

If you change or modify the conference size, the changes take effect immediately.
For example, if you reduce a conference size from ten participants to five on a
specific conference resource, if there are seven participants who have already
joined the conference, the additional two participants are not disconnected.
However, new participants cannot join the conference.
