The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, the SQLExecDirect and SQLExecute
functions return SQL_NO_DATA_FOUND when no rows are affected by an UPDATE,
DELETE, or INSERT statement.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are examples of where an UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT would not
affect any rows:

   UPDATE pubs..publishers SET pub_id='1232' WHERE 1=2

   INSERT INTO temptable (SELECT * FROM pubs..publishers WHERE 1=2)

In such cases, the return code for SQLExecDirect or SQLExecute would be
SQL_NO_DATA_FOUND (instead of SQL_SUCCESS). This is in accordance with the ODBC
specification.

This change was made in the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server version
3.50.0305 and later.

If this change affects your application, you can either add functionality in your
code to process the SQL_NO_DATA_FOUND return code, or you can use the SET
NOCOUNT ON statement so that the return code will be SQL_SUCCESS. The use of SET
NOCOUNT ON tells the server not to return the number of rows that are affected
by the UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT statement; therefore, the ODBC driver just
returns SQL_SUCCESS.
