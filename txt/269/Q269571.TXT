TITLE   :Unsigned CRL File Causes Access Violation in Inetinfo
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2000; winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a client certificate is issued by a certificate authority, it may contain a
Certificate Revocation List (CRL). A CRL is a list that is maintained by a
Certificate Authority (CA) and records the serial numbers of certificates that
have been revoked.

If the CRL file is not signed, the Inetinfo application causes an Access
Violation error message to occur. A Dr. Watson log similar to the following
occurs:

   Application exception occurred:
   App: inetinfo.exe (pid=1116)
   When: 7/25/2000 @ 12:51:14.825
   Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

NOTE: Windows 2000 automatically restarts after this error message appears.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the CRL needs to be signed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ask your CA to correctly sign the CRL file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

1. In Internet Explorer, from the Tools menu, click Internet Options.

2. On the Content tab, click the Certificates button.

3. Double-click the client certificate.

4. Click on the Details tab.

5. Click CRL Distribution Points.
