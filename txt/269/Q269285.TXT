TITLE   :FTP Server Fails to Open Data Connection
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWin2000SP2Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a client requests and receives a file from an Internet Information Services
(IIS) 5.0 FTP server, it issues an 'ABOR' command to close the connection. At
that point, if the client immediately tries to request another file, the IIS FTP
server fails to respond properly by setting up the new connection. Instead, it
issues an unexpected "425 Can't Open Data Connection" error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
