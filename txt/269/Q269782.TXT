TITLE   :XADM: Err 3355443765 Starting Information Store After Restore
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Information Store after a restore is performed, you may
receive an error of 3355443765 reported by the Information Store service.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is caused by a gap in the log files within the log directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Look at the Restore In Progress key to determine which logs should be there.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CURRENTCONTROLSET/SERVICES/MSEXCHANGEIS/RESTORE IN
   PROGRESS

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.
3. Make a note of the following values:

   HighLog Number:
   LowLog Number:

   The values will translate to the name of the log files. For example, if the
   HighLog Number is 0x1268, the log file would be named edb01268.log.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

The only log files that should be present are the log files starting with the
LowLog log file and continuing on and including the HighLog log file. Any other
log files in that directory (including edb.log) are not needed and should be
renamed or moved unless you are performing a No Loss Restore, in which log files
after the HighLog number are in place and will play through.

The Information Store should start after you rename the incorrect log files.

Additional query words: 3355443765 restore HighLog LowLog
