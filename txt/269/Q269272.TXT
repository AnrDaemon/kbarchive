TITLE   :Mail Client Address List Truncated Using "Mailto:" Link

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a hyperlink that uses a "Mailto" Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
with a recipient list that exceeds 260 characters, a truncated address list may
be created in the e-mail program that is started (such as Microsoft Outlook or
Microsoft Outlook Express).

CAUSE
=====

This is a Windows NT 4.0 limitation. The URL is passed to a Windows NT 4.0 shell
function (ShellExecute) to create a process for the mail client to run under.
The Shell function passes the address list as a parameter and the variable used
for that parameter is declared as a fixed size buffer (260 bytes). When the mail
client is started and the address list is passed as a parameter, the address
list is limited to 260 bytes.

RESOLUTION
==========

One possible workaround is to place the members of the recipient list in a
distribution list and reference the distribution list alias in the "Mailto" URL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This issue does not occur in Microsoft Windows 2000.
