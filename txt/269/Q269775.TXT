TITLE   :SMS: WINNT 4 .0 Clients Can't Run SMS From NetWare Logon Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork kbClient kbConfig kbServer kbsms120 kbBindery kbNDS kbOSNovell

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows NT clients executing RUNSMS or SMSLS from a NetWare logon
server fail with the following error message:

   Unable to connect to server

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Microsoft Systems Management Server does not
support the configuration described in the "Symptoms" section.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 2 or later, clients are supported only by
running SMSLS or RUNSMS from Windows NT logon servers. A list of supported
clients and logon server combinations is documented in the SMS 1.2 Getting
Started guide, Appendix B.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Support Limitations
-------------------

Microsoft did not design Systems Management Server 1.<x> to function in a
NetWare Directory Services (NDS) environment. No support is available for
Program Group Control with an NDS logon. No support is available for Microsoft
Windows NT or IBM OS/2 as a Netware client. NetWare clients that connect to
NetWare servers through a protocol other than IPX are also not supported.
