SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the how to use the TakeOwn utility that is included in
the Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit to manage shares in Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The TakeOwn utility is a command-line utility that you can use to clean up
multiple boot drives without formatting the drive. You can use TakeOwn in the
following ways:

 - To enable administrators to take ownership of shares in cases where the
   administrator account has been explicitly denied access. After administrators
   take ownership of the shares or drives, they can run the Cacls utility
   (Cacls.exe).

 - To correct or repair permissions that have been misconfigured or tampered
   with.

You can also use the TakeOwn utility that comes with Windows 2000 Resource Kit
with Windows NT 4.0 to give permissions to administrators to access shares. This
utility runs only on NTFS file system (NTFS) partitions.

To start TakeOwn, run the following command:

   takeown <drive letter>:\share\*.*

When you run the command, the administrator takes ownership of the drive. Then,
when you run the following command, the administrator is given Full Control
permissions to the user's home folders:

   "cacls <drive letter>\users\*.* /e /g administrator:f" (without the
   quotation marks)

To confirm these changes, start Microsoft Windows Explorer, locate the folder,
and then verify that the administrator has ownership of the folder, and has been
given Full Control permissions.
