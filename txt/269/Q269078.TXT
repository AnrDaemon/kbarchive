TITLE   :Domain Names Are Not Displayed in the Accounting Log
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP6,4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) update and you
authenticate against a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS)
server, even though you have set the DoNotStripDomainName registry setting to
log on to multiple account domains, the domain names are not displayed in the
accounting log.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because information about a user's logon domain is only
retained when the information is returned from the authentication server. This
information is not returned from the authentication server when you are using
Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) as the authentication protocol.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
