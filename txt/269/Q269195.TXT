TITLE   :Active Directoy MA Does Not Allow DN
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Management Agent (MA) logon information used to connect to Active
Directory is specified as a distinguished name (DN), the MA cannot locate Active
Directory. The operator's log may contain an error message similar to the
following:

   ERR_00 0590 00/07/20 14:54:10.202 (AD-MA_doSchemaDiscovery) Couldn't bind to
   bpdomain.local: LDAP error 49, Invalid Credentials.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the MA requires the user's credentials to be set up
either as a user principal name, for example, user@domain.com, or in down-level
domain format, for example, domain\user.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, you must set up the user's credentials either as a
user principal name, or in down-level domain format.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Additional query words: metadirectory, via, zoomit, adma
