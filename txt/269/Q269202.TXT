TITLE   :Join Not Working on First Run of Management Agent
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1,2.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, versions 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a new Management Agent in Association mode, you can set the
criteria for joining the Management Agent connectors to metaverse entities by
using connector space values, such as the following:

$mv.cn = $cs.cn

After you run the Management Agent, the join of the connectors to the metaverse
entries fails. In addition, most, if not all, of the connector space entries are
still shown as disconnectors.

CAUSE
=====

Connector space values such as the $cs.cn attribute are not constructed when the
Management Agent is run for the first time.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can resolve this behavior by not using the connector space attributes as
join criteria. Instead, use the connected directory attributes, such as $cd.cn.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recommends the use of the connector space attributes as metaverse join
criteria.

Additional query words: metadirectory, mms, via, zoomit, join
