KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsMeter

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The number of Software Metering licenses may unexpectedly increase when multiple
sites are used to balance software licenses.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because when a site is sent a license, it is not removed
from the sending site until the receiving site acknowledges that it has received
the license.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Example:

You have three license metering servers in your environment. Monitoring for
Microsoft FrontPage, you have allocated 250 licenses per site. After a week of
allowing the sites to run, the number of licenses is now shown as 250, 251, and
253, respectively, for the three sites.

NOTE: This effect was noticed on software that was moved from the excluded
software list to the metered software. Load balancing was set to every hour.
