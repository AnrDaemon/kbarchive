TITLE   :Anonymous FTP Fails with Password Synchronization Enabled
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log into FTP anonymously, the following error message may occur:

   

   c:\ftp ftp.someserver.com
   Connected to ftp.someserver.com.
   220 someserver Microsoft FTP Service (Version 4.0).
   User (ftp.someserver.com:(none)): anonymous
   331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
   Password:
   530 User someuser@microsoft.com cannot log in.
   Login failed.
   ftp>

CAUSE
=====

If the World Wide Web Server component is removed during the installation of the
Windows NT Option Pack, anonymous FTP login fails because automatic password
synchronization relies on a DLL that is uninstalled with the World Wide Web
Server component.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reinstall the World Wide Web Server component from the Windows NT Option Pack
setup.

If the service is not needed, disable the services in Control Panel Services.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Password synchronization is a sub-authentication process used by Internet
Information Server. This functionality is provided by the Iissuba.dll file. This
DLL is uninstalled when the World Wide Web Server component is removed, which in
turn causes anonymous FTP login to fail if the Enable Automatic Password
Synchronization option is checked in the Security settings for the FTP service.
