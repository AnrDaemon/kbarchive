TITLE   :Multiple NFS Shares Can Be Mounted as a Single Drive Mapping
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Services for UNIX Add-On Pack 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you share multiple folders on a single NTFS partition as NFS mounts, they may
all be mounted by the Windows NT NFS client as a single drive mapping. This is
not a feature; mapping to multiple NFS shares in this manner can cause
unpredictable results.

CAUSE
=====

This is a side effect of the parent/child limitation on NFS shares as
implemented in the Services for UNIX NFS server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not mount an NFS share without specifying the full share name or without
specifying the full alias name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot export a parent folder of an exported file system unless the parent
is on a different physical device.
