   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

By default, the locally cached copy of a profile is stored in
%SystemRoot%\Profiles\, which may be an issue if you have a large number of
people logging on to a computer. If you have a large number of people logging on
to a computer (which creates a large number of profiles), disk space on the
operating system partition may become scarce. You can move the locally cached
copy of a profile to another local partition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To move the locally cached copy of the profile, you will need to know the
security identifier (SID) of the user whose profile you want to move. You can
identify the SID by using GetSID.exe from the Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource
Kit.

Windows NT 4.0 stores the local profile information in the registry under the
following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList

Under the ProfileList key, there will be subkeys named with the SIDs of the users
who have logged on to this computer. (To find the profile information for the
user whose locally cached profile you want to move, find the SID for the user
with the GetSID.exe utility.) Inside of the appropriate user's subkey, you will
see a string value named ProfileImagePath. ProfileImagePath should be set to a
local path where you want to store the profile.

If you do not have a roaming profile and you want to maintain your profile after
you change the locally cached profile path, copy the contents of your old
locally cached profile folder to the new location set in the ProfileImagePath
value.
