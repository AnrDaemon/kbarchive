======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer versions 1.0, 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to specify a drive letter on the Application tab within the
Installation Interface properties, entering a colon in the Default Directory
text box will result in the following error message:

   The default directory field should only contain the name of the directory
   itself, not the full pathname including the drive letter. Please enter only
   the directory name itself into this field.

This error prevents you from specifying a drive in the directory path.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually alter the corresponding script item using
the Script Editor view. In the following example "Test" is used as the Default
Directory entered on the Application tab within Installation Interface
properties. To use a specific drive as the default, perform the following
steps:

1. Go to the Script Editor view.

2. Under If System Has Windows 95 Shell Interface Start Block, find and open the
   script item Set Variable MAINDIR to %PROGRAM_FILES%\%MAINDIR%.

3. Change the value %PROGRAM_FILES% to X:\program files, in the New Value text
   box (where X:\ is the preferred default drive letter).

4. Find the script item Set Variable MAINDIR to %SYSDRIVE%:\%MAINDIR% and change
   the value %SYSDRIVE% to X (where X is the preferred default drive letter).
