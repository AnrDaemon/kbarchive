TITLE   :NET USE /d Returns Error 2404 After Applying Service Pack 4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 4 on a workstation or
server, you may receive the following error when you run a script or batch file
that connects to a resource, runs an application, and then disconnects from that
resource:

   The device is being accessed by an active process. More help is available by
   typing NET HELPMSG 2404.

An example script would be similar to the following:

   net use q: \\servername\share
   q:
   login.bat
   c:
   net use q: /d

CAUSE
=====

The redirector holds a reference to the File Control Block (FCB) in the cache. A
fix to the Redirector (Rdr.sys) in Service Pack 4 was made to check for open
references before tearing down the session.

==========
