TITLE   :Dr. Watson Log File May Not Contain Task List
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Drwtsn32.log file created by Dr. Watson may not contain a task list on
systems that use extensible performance counter DLLs, such as Microsoft SQL
Server's Sqlctr60.dll.

CAUSE
=====

Dr. Watson uses the system performance counters to generate the task list. It is
possible for the size of the returned performance data to change between
successive calls to retrieve it. Dr. Watson was not sufficiently tolerant of
such a change.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
it has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Windows NT 4.0
service pack that contains this fix.
