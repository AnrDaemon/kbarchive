KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You may notice that over time there may be many MSExchangeCalCon MAPI profiles
created.

CAUSE
=====

An abnormal shutdown of the Calendar Connector service, for example killing the
Calcon.exe process, will result in the generation of a new MAPI profile for the
Calendar Connector the next time it starts up.

RESOLUTION
==========

The leftover MAPI profiles are harmless and can be safely deleted.

WORKAROUND
==========

The MAPI profiles can also be found at the following registry location:

   \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows
   Messaging Subsystem\Profiles

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

Additional query words: MAPI;Calendar Connector;CALCON
