PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) core component
installation program (Wbemsdk.exe), you may receive the following error
message:

   Installation Aborted! Internal Error.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Temp folder is not available on the computer or the
TEMP environment variable is not configured correctly.

Wbemsdk.exe uses the Temp folder to temporarily store the WMI setup files.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, configure the TEMP environment variable to point to
an existing Temp folder. If you are using Microsoft Windows 95/98, you place a
SET command in the Autoexec.bat file. If you use Microsoft Windows NT, you
configure the TEMP environment variable in the System tool in Control Panel.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Wbemsdk.exe does not install the WMI components correctly, the Systems
Management Server Setup also fails and you receive the following error message:

   Could not compile MOF.

The Systems Management Server Hardware Inventory Client Agent installation also
fails when it attempts to install WMI components.

You can type the SET command at a command prompt to identify all the environment
variables currently configured on your computer.
