TITLE   :FIX: Incorrect Prototype in ClassWizard CRecordset::Move()
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbDatabase kbVC600bug kbNoUpdate

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the ClassWizard to generate an override for the Move() virtual
method in a CRecordset derived class, the prototype provided is incorrect.

This produces a new virtual function, not an override for the Move() method
specified in the base class. As a result, whenever the Move() function is called
through a pointer to the base class (CRecordset) the generated Move() function
that the developer expects to override the base class Move()) is ignored, and
the base class Move() is called instead.

RESOLUTION
==========

Manually edit the generated text or do not use the ClassWizard.

The generated text is:

   class CMyRecordset : public CRecordset
   {  // [...]
      //{{AFX_VIRTUAL(CMyRecordset)
      public:
      // [...]
      virtual void Move(long lRows);
      //}}AFX_VIRTUAL
      // [...]
   };

Edit as follows:

   class CMyRecordset : public CRecordset
   {  // [...]
      //{{AFX_VIRTUAL(CMyRecordset)
      public:
      // [...]
      virtual void Move(long lRows, WORD wFetchType = SQL_FETCH_RELATIVE);
      //}}AFX_VIRTUAL
      // [...]
   };

You need to make similar changes in the implementation file for
CMyRecordset::Move().

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new MFC project with any level of database support.

2. Use ClassWizard to add a new class, CMyRecordset derived from CRecordset.

3. Right-click on the new class in ClassView and click Add virtual function.
   Click Move.

RESULT: Look in the header file and the implementation file for the generated
class. The prototype used for Move() is not correct.
