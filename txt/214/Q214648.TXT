The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

Upon performing an initial directory synchronization from Exchange Server to
Novell GroupWise, you may notice the following error message in the API
gateway:

   There are no objects which match the query criteria.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The directory synchronization cycle between Exchange Server and GroupWise
involves two sets of transactions. During the first transaction, the GroupWise
connector will send a "LIST" type command to the GroupWise system, essentially
asking for GroupWise to return a directory list of all objects that belong to a
specific GroupWise Domain and post office (in this case, the Exchange Server
reference). The GroupWise system will then send a response to Exchange Server
containing all, if any, objects that match the query. The Microsoft Exchange
Connector for Novell GroupWise then processes this response and sends the second
transaction to GroupWise with any updates from the selected EXPORT containers.
(There are actually two API messages, one to create the Exchange Server post
office object, and one containing all the user objects). The GroupWise system
will then create the Exchange Server post office object and all corresponding
Exchange Server user objects.

The error message will only be encountered during an initial directory
synchronization to GroupWise because the "LIST" message is asking for a
non-existent object in GroupWise.

However, if you are continually encountering this error message, there is most
likely a misconfiguration on the API gateway or the GroupWise connector. Refer
to the documentation included with these components for details on configuring
them.
