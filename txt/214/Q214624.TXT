TITLE   :STOP 0xA When Using SPX
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the SPX protocol is used with a network adapter driver that is NDIS 4.0
compliant, a STOP 0xA error message may be displayed in Ndis.sys.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Nwlnkspx.sys driver allocates its own NDIS
packets. It does not call the NDIS library routines that allocate NDIS packets
for protocol drivers. Because Nwlnkspx.sys allocates its own packets, it does
not initialize reserved fields in the NDIS packet structure used primarily by
NDIS 4.0-compliant adapter drivers.



RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the latest driver from the vendor of your
network adapter.

-or-

Revert to the NDIS 3.0 driver provided by the vendor of your network adapter.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was first corrected in Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 5.
