KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Hewlett-Packard (HP) JetAdmin port monitor on a computer
running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, the Spooler service may randomly stop and
require a manual restart. Print jobs may not be printed without stopping and
restarting the Spooler service.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can be caused by a conflict between the Spooler service and the HP
JetAdmin port monitor software.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this issue from occurring, configure your computer's printers to use
Microsoft Windows NT LPR Port Monitor:

1. Install the Microsoft TCP/IP Printing service: Click Start, point to
   Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click Network.

2. Click the Services tab, click Add, click Microsoft TCP/IP Printing in the
   Network Service box, and then click OK.

3. When you are prompted, type the full path to the installation files folder
   (for example, D:\I386), click Continue, click Close, and then restart the
   computer when you are prompted.

4. Create an LPR port for each printer currently using an HP port. For
   information about adding and configuring LPR ports, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q195643How to Configure Windows NT for LPR Printing

5. Remove the HP JetAdmin software. To do this, click Start, point to Settings,
   click Control Panel, and then double-click Add/Remove Programs.

6. In the list of installed programs click JetAdmin, click Add/Remove, click
   Yes, click OK, and then click OK.
