======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Package Command Manager (PCM) launches a program written in FoxPro version
2.6, the FoxPro program starts and runs as expected, but the workstation may not
shut down properly after you have quit the program.

Well after the FoxPro program has been quit, the Pcmwin.log file may repeat
entries similar to the following:

   [10/29/96 12:15:39] Package Command Manager ==> A job is in process.
   [10/29/96 12:15:41] Package Command Manager ==> Monitoring running job.
   [10/29/96 12:15:41] Package Command Manager ==> The running process handle is 9230

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because when you start a program built with FoxPro 2.6
for Windows, the FoxPro executable (*.exe) functions as a loader program. It
loads Foxw2600.esl (a support library), which actually runs the code. PCM
obtains a process handle to the support library instead of to the FoxPro
program.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, follow these steps:

1. Create a Microsoft Visual Basic wrapper program that calls the FoxPro program
   or installation executable.

2. Create and distribute a package that runs the Visual Basic wrapper program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
