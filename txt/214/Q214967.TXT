TITLE   :SMS: Error Message from Selecting and Then Clearing Option
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select and then clear the This Product is a Suite Parent option while
using Licadmin.exe (the Software Metering console), you receive the following
error message:

   You have entered an invalid program name.
   Valid extensions are .exe, dll, bin, mod, tsk, scr.
   Invalid characters are

   \/:*?"<>|

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because when you originally specify the product as a Suite
Parent while adding a new product in the Software Metering console, the file is
renamed with an .sui extension. If you then clear the This Product is a Suite
Parent option, the extension still identifies the product as a Suite Parent with
an .sui extension.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, manually change the product name back to its original
extension.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 2.0.
