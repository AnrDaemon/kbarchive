TITLE   :XFOR: OVVM Connector Sends Incorrect Loc. Info. in Meeting Req.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Exchange Server users may find that upon receiving a meeting request from a host
user (OVVM), the location information is incorrect. This behavior occurs when
the original host user does not specify a Location field in the meeting request;
the OV/VM (PROFS) connector uses a value from a previous meeting request
containing location information.

CAUSE
=====

This is the result of a bug during the parsing of the meeting request by the
OV/VM (PROFS) connector. Note that this bug only applies to the Web 2 or later
version of the OV/VM (PROFS) connector.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: PROFS

+-------------------------+
| File Name  | Version    | 
+-------------------------+
| Lsvmhc.dll | 5.5.2543.0 |

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server 5.5 for the
Intel and Alpha versions. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 3.
