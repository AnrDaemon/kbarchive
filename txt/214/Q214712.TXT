KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Files with the extension *.mmp accumulate in the Webtemp directory when you
connect to Microsoft Exchange Server through Outlook Web Access (OWA) and do not
log out properly. If you try to delete these files, you may receive an error
message similar to the following:

   Cannot delete <temp file name>: Access is Denied.
   Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not
   currently in use.


CAUSE
=====

If you do not log out of OWA properly, the *.mmp files will be locked because
the system thinks that the process is still using these temporary files.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

   

 - Stop and re-start the WWW Service.

   -or-

 - Restart the OWA server.
