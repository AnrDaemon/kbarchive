TITLE   :SMSINST: Change Window Hides Buttons When Using Repackage
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,2.0; winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms120 kbsmsInst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer versions 1.0, 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After clicking the Change button at the beginning of a Repackage, the OK,
Cancel, Apply, and Help buttons may become hidden by the Task Bar on machines
running the Windows 95/Windows NT 4.0 desktop shell.

CAUSE
=====

This can occur when the machine used to compile the Installer script is running
a display resolution of 640 x 480. Many of the configuration screens used in
Systems Management Server Installer are designed to accommodate large amounts of
information and options. This can result in Installer configuration dialog boxes
using a large portion of the viewing area when the display is less than 800 x
600.

WORKAROUND
==========

It is recommended that you increase the display resolution to 800 x 600 or
higher to allow for maximum viewing.

You may also be able to access these buttons by hiding the Task Bar on the
machine. For information on how to hide the Task Bar on machines running Windows
95/98 or Windows NT 4.0, please refer to the following article in the Microsoft
