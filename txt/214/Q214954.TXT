The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up a Software Metering server in Systems Management Server (SMS)
2.0, the installation may not succeed and the following error message may be
generated in the Licsvcfg.log file:

   INFO: installation destination = '\\<Servername>\LicMtr'
   Checking for the existence of a License Server share
   \\<Servername>\LicMtr
   ERROR: FAILED TO INSTALL LICENSE SERVER '<Servername>'

CAUSE
=====

The Software Metering installation process checks for the existence of the
LicMtr share before installing a Software Metering server. The LicMtr share may
exist if you previously started to install a Software Metering server but you
stopped the installation after the LicMtr share was created but before the
installation process was finished.

WORKAROUND
==========

Manually delete the LicMtr share. The Software Metering server installation
process checks the site control file to verify successful installation; if the
installation was incomplete, the installation is retried automatically retried.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
