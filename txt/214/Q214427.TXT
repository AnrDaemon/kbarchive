TITLE   :FIX: "Prompt To Save Changes" Setting Crashes VB IDE Upon Saving
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbVBp600bug kbIDEProject kbGrpDSVB kbVS600sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enable the "Prompt to Save Changes" setting in a Visual Basic IDE and
open a project and site a TextBox with its DataFormat property set to a value
other than default, the Visual Basic IDE crashes upon saving the project files
when the application is started from the Sub Main of a module.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Place a TextBox on Form1. Set Text1's DataFormat property to anything other
   than the default (Number, for instance), and then click Apply.

3. From the Project menu, add a Standard module to the project and paste the
   following code into Module1:

   Public Sub Main()
      Form1.Show
   End Sub

4. On the Tools menu, click Options. Select the Environment tab and make sure
   that Prompt to Save Changes is selected.

5. On the Project menu, click Project1 Properties. Set the Startup object as Sub
   Main.

6. Press the F5 key to run the project. Visual Basic will prompt you to save the
   files (frm, bas, and vbp). Accept the defaults and click OK. Once the save is
   completed, Visual Basic will crash with an error message and the IDE is shut
   down. The exact error message may differ, but should be similar to the
   following:

   VB6.EXE - Application Error
   The Instruction at "0x001a09b2" referenced memory at "0x00000000". The memory
   could not be "read"
