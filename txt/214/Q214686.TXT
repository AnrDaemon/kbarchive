SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT Performance counters for the MSExchangeMTA object

indicate a lapsed time for a queue that has no messages currently waiting.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange message transfer agent (MTA) may not properly update the
counter when the MTA is started, or after the last message has been deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
