TITLE   :SFU Password Synchronization to Digital UNIX Server Problem
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::; winnt:4.0

KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Services for UNIX Add-On Pack 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Services for UNIX (SFU) password synchronization may post the
following error message in the System log on the Digital UNIX host on which the
Microsoft Encrypted Password Protocol (MEPP) daemon (SSOD) is running:

   8201: user <name> does not exist on host digital

The following error message is posted in the Windows NT System event log on the
Windows NT server that is running the Password Synchronization service:

   Secret key mismatch

The Digital UNIX host should post an "8203: secret key mismatch or packet error
for user <name> on host digital" error message.

CAUSE
=====

The shared secret key is mismatched between the SFU Password Synchronization
service and the SSOD daemon on the UNIX host.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, reset the shared secret key on both the SFU server and
the UNIX host to a matching key.

NOTE: The shared secret key is case sensitive.
