TITLE   :DSMN - Access Violation in Swsvc.exe When Comparing Two Strings
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Directory Services for NetWare (DSMN) fails intermittently, generating the
following Dr. Watson error:

   The application swsvc.exe has generated an application error.

The following message is also written to the System Event Log:

   Event ID: 4097: The application, exe\swsvc.dbg, generated an application
   error. The exception is c0000005 at address 77a056e1 (wcsicmp).

CAUSE
=====

The DSMN service will fail periodically when attempting to rename an account
(user, or local or a global group). For example, it fails when the
pszOldAcctName is set to a null value and Windows NT attempts to dereference
this Null pointer in the _wcsicmp() routine. There are several conditions in the
SwpRenameAccount() routine where the pszOldAcctName string can be set to a Null
value; however, Windows NT never tests this string before making a call to
_wcsicmp() routine.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:
