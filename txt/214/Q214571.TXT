TITLE   :Duplicate Remote APPC LUs Can Be Created On A Connection
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna300sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0 SP1 allow an administrator to create multiple
Remote APPC (Advanced Program-to-Program Communications) LUs using the same
Fully Qualified LU Name on the same connection. For example, the following are
Remote APPC LUs that have unique aliases and the same Fully Qualified LU Name:

   Remote LU #1:
   LU Alias: REMOTE1
   Network Name: APPN
   LU Name: REMOTE

   Remote LU #2:
   LU Alias: REMOTE2
   Network Name: APPN
   LU Name: REMOTE

The Fully Qualified LU Name for each of the Remote APPC LUs is APPN.REMOTE.

The following error will be displayed when SNA Server Manager on a SNA Server
version 3.0 SP2 or later system is used to open a SNA Server version 3.0 or 3.0
SP1 configuration file (Com.cfg) that contains duplicate Remote APPC LUs on a
connection:

   SnaOle

   The Fully Qualified LU Name has already been used.
   The combination of the Net Name and LU Name cannot be the same as any other
   APPC LU on the server.

CAUSE
=====

The ability to add Remote APPC LUs using the same Fully Qualified LU Name to the
same connection was inadvertantly added to SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0 SP1.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the duplicate Remote APPC LUs from the SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 SP1
configurations before upgrading to SNA Server 3.0 SP2 or later.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1
and 4.0 SP2. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 3.0 Service
Pack 4 and SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Remote APPC LUs with the same Fully Qualified LU Name are allowed on a SNA
Server as long as they are defined on different connections.

SNA Server versions 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, and 4.0 (all services packs) do not allow
duplicate Remote APPC LUs on the same connection. This is the correct and
expected behavior.
