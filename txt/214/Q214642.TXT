TITLE   :XADM: Savechanges() Fails with MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND Error When Savin
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MAPI API IMessage::Savechanges() may fail with a MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND error when
saving a message with custom properties whose property ranges are in the
allowable ranges defined by the MAPI spec (0x6800 - 0x7FF).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This can occur when you attemp to "overload" property IDs by using several of
the same property tag IDs with differing types. The Micrososft Information Store
will not allow more than a single type per property tag in a single folder.

Because, internally, a folder contains both associated messages and normal
messages in the same table, a situation can arise where two different property
types are used for different types of messages. In this instance, the first to
be written to the message will be the only allowable type in that folder (that
is, Savechanges() will now fail if you attempt to use a different type for this
property in future Savechanges calls).

Recognizing the occurence can be difficult (unless you are the software author).
Treat this as a rare case.
