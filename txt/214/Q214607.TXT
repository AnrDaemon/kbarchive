TITLE   :BUG: Cannot Add a Secured VBA Module to SourceSafe.
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0; :
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbAccess kbSSafe600 kbSSafe600bug kbOffice2000 kbDSupport kbBug kbGrpDSSSafe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Office 2000 Developer 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When adding a password protected Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) project to
SourceSafe, you will see one of the following errors. The error you see depends
on whether the VBA project is part of an Access 2000 database or one of the
other Office 2000 applications.

 - When adding an Access 2000 module to SourceSafe the following error message
   appears:

   Failed to export <object name> to a file.

 - When adding an Office 2000 VBA project (non-Access) to SourceSafe the
   following error message appears.:

   The addin was unable to retrieve information about the current project and
   cannot continue.

   If you attempt to add to SourceSafe again, the following error message
   appears:

   50289: Can't perform operation since the project is protected.

CAUSE
=====

SourceSafe cannot display the Password dialog box for the project. Therefore,
the project can not be opened for insertion into the VSS database.

RESOLUTION
==========

Manually open the project in the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) and supply the
password when prompted. Once the project has been opened, you will be able to
add the project to the VSS database.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

4. Add a password to the project by choosing Tools - <database name>
   Properties and then selecting the Protection tab. Select "Lock project for
   viewing" and type a password.

5. Save the module.

6. Quit VBE and return to Microsoft Access 2000.

7. Exit Microsoft Access 2000.

8. Open Microsoft Access 2000 and choose that database.
