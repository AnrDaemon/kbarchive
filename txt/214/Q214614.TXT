TITLE   :APPC Application Works on SNA 2.11, Fails on SNA 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0SP3,4.0,4.0SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna300sp4fix kbsna400sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After upgrading from SNA Server 2.11 to SNA Server 4.0, an APPC application
started failing with the following allocation error:

   primary_rc = AP_ALLOCATION_ERROR (0x0003)
   secondary_rc = AP_SECURITY_NOT_VALID (0x080F6051)

When the application attempted to allocate a conversation by specifying security
= AP_SAME and a user ID, SNA Server 4.0 no longer sent any security information
to the host, causing the host to reject the FMH-5 Attach request.

CAUSE
=====

Under SNA Server 4.0, SNA Server no longer sends security vectors in the FMH-5
Attach request if the APPC application specifies security = AP_SAME, and the
host indicates no support for "already verified" or "persistent verification."
Byte 23 of the host BIND indicates the security options supported by the host
for an LU6.2 session. In this particular case, the host BIND indicated support
for receiving security information in FMH-5 Attach requests, but no support for
"already verified" or "persistent verification."

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1
and 4.0 SP2. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 3.0 Service
Pack 4 and SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When this fix is applied, SNA Server reverts to 2.11 behavior and includes the
user ID *and* password in the FMH-5 Attach request, when the application
requests security = AP_SAME, and the host indicates support for receiving access
security information in the FMH-5 Attach request.
