TITLE   :WD97: "Print to File" Option Set After Printing from Binder
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbdta word8 word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you print a binder that contains two or more files (at least one of them is a
Word document), and then print from a separate session of Word, the Print to
file option is turned on automatically.

NOTE This problem occurs when the binder is left open after printing and then you
start Word.

CAUSE
=====

The Print binder as a single job option is selected (default) in Microsoft
Binder. With this option selected, Binder prints to a file before sending the
file to the printer. Thus, the Print to file option remains selected when you
start Word.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods appropriate for
your situation:

Method 1: Turn Off the Print Binder as a Single Job Option
----------------------------------------------------------

1. In Microsoft Binder, click Binder Options on the File menu.

2. Under Apply to all binders, clear the Print binder as a single job check box.

3. Click OK.

Method 2: Quit Binder
---------------------

Before you start Word, quit Microsoft Binder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
