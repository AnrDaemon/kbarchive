TITLE   :XADM: Store Handle Leak with Invalid POP3 NTLM Authentication
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange500preSP3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Information Store service may leak handles when POP3
users attempt to use NTLM authentication with credentials that fail to be
authenticated. To observe if this happening, start Performance Monitor and add
the Handle Count counter for the Services.exe instance under the PROCESS object.
This counter will increase as failed logins increase.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Information Store service creates a credential handle (in
Services.exe) when a user attempts to log on. If the credentials that are passed
in fail authentication, the Information Store service does not free the handle.
Instead, it creates a new handle on the next attempt. These handles are not
freed up until the Exchange Information Store service is stopped.

NOTE: This behavior is corrected in Version 5.5 of the product.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
