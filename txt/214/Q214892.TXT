The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install the Systems Management Server (SMS) client software
on a computer that is a workgroup member and is running Microsoft Windows NT
Workstation, you may receive the following error message in the Clicfg.log
file:

   Network path not found

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the computer unsuccessfully attempts to use NetBIOS
name resolution to locate an SMS server on the network.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem from occurring, use either of the following methods:

 - If your computer uses the Microsoft Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS)
   for NetBIOS name resolution, verify that your computer can communicate with
   the WINS server. For information about troubleshooting WINS issues, please
   see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q169790How to Troubleshoot Basic TCP/IP Problems in Windows NT 4.0

 - If your computer does not use WINS, you can use an LMHOSTS file on your
   computer to identify the NetBIOS name and TCP/IP address of the SMS server.
   For information about creating an LMHOSTS file, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
