TITLE   :Access Violation in Spoolss.exe on Windows NT Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:TSESP4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a non-administrative user with the appropriate permissions attempts to
change printer properties on Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server
Edition, he or she receives an access violation in the spooler (Spoolss.exe).

CAUSE
=====

For this problem to occur, the user attempting to change the printer settings
must have been granted full control to the printer, but must not be an
administrator. This problem is caused when a call is made to the SetPrinter()
API by any application, the printer properties dialog box is simply one example
of this problem.

The access violation is caused because a data structure being used by the printer
API is cleared when it should not be, so subsequent usage of that data structure
causes an access violation.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
