   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

You may want to suppress the following message:

   A domain controller for your domain could not be contacted. You have been
   logged on using cached account information. Changes made to your profile
   since you last logged on may not be available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On the client computer, enter the registry value ReportDC to suppress this
message from users. The Winlogon subkey stores configuration data for the
Winlogon service that applies to all users of the computer.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Registry path:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

   ReportDC   REG_DWORD

   Value      Meaning
   -----      -------
   0 -	      The domain controller message is suppressed.
   1 -	      The domain controller message is not suppressed.

Note that Microsoft Windows 2000 suppresses this dialog box by default (the
setting is zero).
