SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 server component logging is turned
off by default. Enabling logging for all SMS components causes up to a
10-percent performance decrease. For this reason, logging is not enabled. When
troubleshooting SMS 2.0, problem status messages may not provide the level of
granularity you need to resolve some problems. When this happens you will need
to enable logging for all of the SMS components involved. Follow the steps below
to enable logging:

1. Go to the Tools node in the SMS Administrator Console.

2. Right-Click the SMS Service Manager to start it.

3. In the left window pane go to <Site Code>/Servers/<Server Name>.

4. Now you can select one or more components while holding down the CTRL key,
   and then navigate to the Component menu and select Logging. Then select the
   Enable Logging check box.

Once logging is enabled, the logs can be found in the \SMS\Logs directory.
Component logging on clients is enabled by default.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You need to account for adequate disk space when you enable logging. At times a
component may use up to 2 megabytes (MB) of space for logging. It is best to
account for 2 MB of free space for each component.
