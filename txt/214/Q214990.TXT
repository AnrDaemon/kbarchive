KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to check out licenses on a computer running Systems Management
Server Software Metering Client Agent, you are unable to start Check32.exe.

Additionally, you may receive the following message:

   There are no products for you to check out.

CAUSE
=====

Before you are able to check out a license, the following conditions must be
true:

 - The product has been launched at the Software Metering server to trigger
   balancing.

 - Replication of this license has occurred at the Software Metering server.

 - Licenses are available at the Software Metering server to allow you check out
   the product license.

WORKAROUND
==========

Allow additional time for all updates and changes to occur between the Software
Metering server, the Systems Management Server site, and the client.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
