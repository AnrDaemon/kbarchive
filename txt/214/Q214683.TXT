TITLE   :WD97: Duplex Printing Does Not Work with Objects on Page
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document that contains objects on the page and choose duplex
printing, the document does not duplex print. This happens when you print the
document to a LaserJet printer in PCL mode.

CAUSE
=====

When a page contains objects, Word automatically enables the printer's "Print
TrueType as graphics" option. This change requires a reset of the printer, and
the reset takes place between pages. Thus it forces the next page onto a new
sheet of paper, rather than on the back of the first page.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, turn on the printer's "Print TrueType as graphics"
option. This ensures that this option is always selected; therefore the printer
does not have to be reset while printing.

To turn on this option, follow these steps:

1. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Click the appropriate PCL HP LaserJet printer icon.

3. On the File menu, click Properties.

4. In the Properties dialog box, click the Fonts tab.

5. In the Fonts dialog box, under TrueType fonts, select "Print TrueType as
   graphics" and click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
This problem does not occur in Word 2000.
