======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Windows 95, you may receive frequent (every 10 or 20
minutes) "Parity Error" messages on a blue screen. When you receive such a
message, you must restart the computer.

CAUSE
=====

Parity errors are usually caused by defective memory chips in the computer. For
more information about parity errors, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q93521 Parity Errors in Windows 3.x

Parity errors can also be caused by:

 - Mismatched RAM. That is, mixing different types of SIMMs (such as parity and
   non-parity RAM) on the motherboard.

 - Incorrect RAM for the motherboard. For example, non-parity RAM on a
   motherboard requiring parity RAM.

 - Non-proprietary RAM on a motherboard that required proprietary RAM.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two methods you can use to identify whether defective memory chips are
causing the problem:

 - Remove or replace memory chips in the computer to see if the problem is
   resolved.

 - Try limiting the amount of memory that Windows 95 uses. To do so, follow
   these steps:

   1. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the System.ini file.

   2. Add the following line in the [386Enh] section of the file

   MaxPhysPage=<nnn>

      where <nnn> determines the amount of memory you want Windows 95 to
      use.

      To limit Windows 95 to the first 16 MB of memory, add the following line:

   MaxPhysPage=FFF

      To limit Windows 95 to the first 8 MB of memory, add the following line:

   MaxPhysPage=7FF

      To limit Windows 95 to the first 4 MB of memory, add the following line:

   MaxPhysPage=3FF

   3. Save and then close the System.ini file.

   4. Restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Defective memory chips may not be detected by memory checking tools. Some memory
checking programs are not adequate tests because they do not test RAM in the
same way that Windows uses RAM. Most memory checkers use read/write cycles when
scanning memory. Since Windows is executing code from memory, it uses execute
cycles. Execute cycles are different from read/write cycles and are more
vulnerable to parity errors. It is possible for memory checking programs to find
parity errors if the memory is extremely faulty. Bad memory chips can also cause
the following situations:

 - Fatal Exception errors

 - Himem.sys load failures in normal or Safe mode

 - Random lockups

 - The computer may stop responding (hang) as soon as you turn it on
