TITLE   :No Compaq Netflex Drivers in Windows NT 3.51 for RISC Platforms
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When installing or upgrading Windows NT 3.51 on a RISC platform, the Compaq
Netflex network interface card (NIC) is not recognized or the driver is not
updated.

NOTE: The Windows NT 3.5 driver does not work correctly on version 3.51.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft has removed support for Netflex NICs from Windows NT because Compaq
only supports the Intel platform with the adapters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

The Compaq Netflex NIC in RISC computers is supported by Microsoft. It is
currently the only Token Ring adapter supporting promiscuous mode for RISC
platforms. A driver for this NIC is planned for future versions of Windows NT.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

NOTE: The files are located in the \SUPPORT\NDIS\NETFLEX directory on the Service
Pack CD.
