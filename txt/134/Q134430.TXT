The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the MSMailBackup Control Panel used by Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk
Networks restarts the mail server to backup the server's mail data file, a
notification message can be sent to a user upon completion. If the administrator
wants to disable the notification, he or she can leave the Sent Status To: field
empty.

When the backup process is complete, the following dialog will be presented:

   Your Microsoft Mail Datafile was backed up successfully.
   However, a status message explaining this could not be sent.

When you select the OK button to clear the dialog box, the startup process will
continue.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The startup process will have the appearance of being halted until you select
the OK button. However, the System processes are actually running. The Finder's
user interface is suspended until the OK button is selected, and the Mail
service is not interrupted.
