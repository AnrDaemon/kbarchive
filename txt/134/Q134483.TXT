======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

You delete a file inside the Briefcase with the intention of breaking the
relationship between the Briefcase copy and the original file only to find that
Briefcase suggests deleting the original as well.

CAUSE
=====

The Briefcase default behavior is to synchronize any change made to the file in
the Briefcase with the original outside the Briefcase. If one of these files is
deleted, Briefcase assumes the copy is to be deleted as well.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use either of the following methods to work around this behavior:

 - Before deleting the file in the Briefcase, select it and then click Split
   From Original on the Briefcase menu. Any subsequent changes to the file are
   ignored by Briefcase.

 - Delete the file in Briefcase. Click Don't Delete before updating the
   Briefcase. To use this method, follow these steps:

   1. On the Briefcase menu, click Update All.

   2. Use the right mouse button to click the file that has "Delete" as the
      suggested action, and then click Don't Delete on the menu that appears.

   3. Repeat step 2 for any other files you do not want to delete.

   4. Click the Update button.
