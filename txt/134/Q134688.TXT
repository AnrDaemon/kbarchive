TITLE   :SNA Server Does Not Allow Configuration of LU Address 255
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server Admin does not allow you to configure LU number 255 when you
configure 3270, LUA, or Downstream LUs with SNA Server Admin.

NOTE: VTAM allows you to configure dependent LUs with a local address (locaddr
parameter in VTAM) of 255.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server Admin allows you to configure LU numbers only up to 254.

Earlier versions of VTAM have a problem configuring and using LUs with a local
address of 255. Although the problem has been resolved on the host this
restriction still exists in SNA Server.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the files SNASERVR.EXE, TRCSERVR.EXE, SNAADMIN.EXE,
SNACFG.DLL, and SNACFG.EXE, to correct this problem.

To work around this problem, do not use LU number 255 with SNA Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
