TITLE   :"Cannot Find File" When Object Clicked to Run Interactively
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbole

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a drawn object or imported graphic during a slide show to run it,
you may get the following error message:

   (application) cannot find the file (c:\(path)\(filename.xxx)

CAUSE
=====

With some computers, long filenames can cause this problem. When you configured
the object's interactive settings, you may have specified the location of this
program with long filenames.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you encounter this problem, you can do one of the following:

1. Select the object and click Interactive Settings on the Tools menu.

2. In the Run Program box, change the path so that it uses the MS-DOS short
   filenames. For example:

   c:\office\winword\winword.exe c:\mydocu~1\docume~1.doc

   Or, enclose the path that includes long filenames in quotation marks. For
   example:

   c:\office\winword\winword.exe "c:\my documents\document.doc"

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem, and we will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
