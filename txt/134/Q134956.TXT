TITLE   :Logon Script Not Removed After Domain Is Removed From Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When a Windows NT domain is added to a Systems Management Server site, there is
an option to configure the logon script of each user account to run SMSLS.BAT.
If the user account did not contain a logon script prior to this action, it
receives the SMSLS logon script. User accounts configured for a logon script
prior to this action will have their logon script files modified with a
reference to SMSLS.BAT.

If the Windows NT domain is removed from the site, the SMSLS.BAT file is removed
from %SYSTEMROOT%>\SYSTEM32\REPL\IMPORT\SCRIPTS directory. However, the
references to SMSLS are not removed from the domain user account profiles.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, modify the domain user account profiles using User
Manage for Domains to remove the reference to SMSLS.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
