-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows 95, you may receive the following error message:

   Software has been installed which interferes with the proper working of the
   Windows 95 display mini-driver...

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program for some third-party programs replaces the Windows 95
Pnpdrvr.drv video driver. The video driver supplied by these programs turns off
the device bitmap capability needed for Windows 95 display mini- drivers. The
following programs are known to cause this problem:

 - PCAnywhere 2.0 by Symantec

 - Carbon Copy 2.5 by Microcom

 - Close Up 6.0 by Lambert

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the Windows 95 standard VGA video driver when you are running any of the
programs listed above. Or, call the program's manufacturer to inquire about
obtaining an update to the program that corrects this problem.
