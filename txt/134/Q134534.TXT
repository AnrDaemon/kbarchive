KEYWORDS:win95

SYMPTOMS
========

After a computer terminates a Direct Cable Connection connection using a
parallel cable, the mouse pointer does not move smoothly and multimedia sound
"stutters" for about 30 seconds.

CAUSE
=====

The parallel driver (Paralink.vxd) may not sense that the other system has
dropped the connection. During the first 30 seconds, it tries periodically to
detect whether the other system is still active. Each time it tries to detect
the other system, the parallel driver turns off the interrupt that prevents
other hardware interrupts from being serviced.

RESOLUTION
==========

Wait approximately 30 seconds. The parallel driver will realize the connection
has been terminated and the system will operate normally.
