TITLE   :Changing Domains in SNA Admin Gives Wrong Status Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server Admin program allows an administrator to manage an entire domain
(or subdomain) of SNA Servers. The administrator can switch focus to a different
domain using the File / Select Domain option.

If there are connections of the same name configured within two different SNA
Server domains (or subdomains), SNA Admin may not display the correct connection
and LU status information when focusing on another domain.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Admin program caches status information on a connection in order
to optimize performance. However, if the administrator switches to another
domain which happens to have a connection configured with the same name as a
connection in the previous domain, SNA Admin does not properly retrieve the
updated status information from the new server, causing the connection and LU
status information to be incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the file SNAADMIN.EXE to correct this problem.

To work around this problem, the SNA Server 2.11 Admin must be stopped and
restarted.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
