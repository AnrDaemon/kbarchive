======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using an ATI mouse, MS-DOS-based communication programs may not
operate properly in Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

There is an incompatibility with the real-mode ATI mouse driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make a backup copy of the Config.sys file and then remove the ATI mouse driver
line from the Config.sys file. When you restart your computer, the ATI mouse
will operate correctly in Windows 95, but will be disabled in real mode.

To get full functionality in both protected mode and real mode, contact ATI to
inquire about obtaining an updated version of their mouse driver.
