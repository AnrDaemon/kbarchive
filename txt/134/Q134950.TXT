TITLE   :X400: Err Msg: Translate to Local Form Failed on Message:
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.2 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 may not be able to
successfully translate messages to local form. As a result, the following error
will occur:

   ERROR 3 (transmitting message to local message store): Translate to local
   form failed on message: xxxxxxxx

where xxxxxxxx is the message hexid that is then copied to the \X400\BAD
directory on the gateway postoffice.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if the X400GATE.EXE is being executed from a network drive,
as opposed to local drive. When the X.400 gateway is installed, it prompts for
the drive and path to the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks executable files. This
is where X400GATE.EXE is placed. If it is located on a network drive, this error
may occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

Move the file X400GATE.EXE to a local drive, and ensure the TMP environment
variable is pointing to a valid temporary directory on the local drive.

Additional query words: 3.20 3.x
