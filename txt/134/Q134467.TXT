SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the game, El Fish, by Maxis, you may receive the following
message

   EL-FISH started. Wait please...

and then the program appears to stop responding.

CAUSE
=====

When you start the game, El Fish, the game tries to calibrate the speed of the
computer. This calibration fails if you have a computer with a Pentium
processor.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, run the game in MS-DOS mode. To do so, follow
these steps:

1. In My Computer, using the right mouse button, click the El Fish icon, and
   then click Properties on the menu that appears.

2. In the El Fish Properties dialog box, click the Program tab, and then click
   the Advanced button.

3. In the Advanced Program Settings dialog box, make sure the MS-DOS mode box is
   checked.

4. Select the Use Current MS-DOS Configuration button.

5. Click the OK button in all the dialog boxes that appear.

If the game still does not start properly, contact the program vendor.
