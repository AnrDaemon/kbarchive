SYMPTOMS

The Audited software property does not show up in the Systems Management Server
Personal Computer Properties after you run an audit package on a Windows for
Workgroups client that is part of a Windows NT domain within a Systems
Management Server site.

On Windows for Workgroups clients that are members of a Windows NT Systems
Management Server domain and have both Microsoft and NetWare ODI networking
protocols installed, the audit package fails when run from Package Command
Manager. The following error is logged in the AUDIT16.LOG file on the client:

      Reading packages             [Done]
