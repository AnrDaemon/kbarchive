TITLE   :Starting Media Player Plays Audio CD

PROD/VER:Win2000:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Media Player, an audio CD in the CD-ROM drive may begin playing.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur with older NEC CD-ROM drives connected to a Trantor SCSI
adapter. These CD-ROM drives have a BIOS revision that is not completely
compatible with the Windows 95 Trantor driver.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Upgrade the CD-ROM drive to a firmware revision of 2.2 or later. Please
   contact the drive manufacturer for information about a firmware upgrade.

 - Prevent Windows 95 from playing audio CDs automatically. For information
   about this method, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

   Q126025 Preventing Windows 95 from Playing Audio CDs Automatically

 - Load the real-mode driver that came with the CD-ROM drive.

   To use a real-mode driver instead of the Windows 95 protected-mode driver,
   load the driver in the Config.sys file, and load the Mscdex.exe file included
   with Windows 95 in the Autoexec.bat file following the manufacturer's
   instructions.

   NOTE: If these drivers were already installed when you installed Windows 95,
   they may still be in the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files, but be remarked
   out.
