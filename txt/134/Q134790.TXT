SUMMARY
=======

You can add code to command buttons created by the Form Wizard and still have
the command buttons function properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The command buttons created by the Form Wizard are based on classes defined in
the Vfp\Wizards\Wizstyle.vcx visual class library.

All of the command buttons are contained in one of three classes, depending on
which style of buttons was used:

class Name      Button Style
--------------------------------
txtbtns         Horizontal; text
verttxtbtns     Vertical; text
picbtns         Horizontal; picture

Each button is assigned an individual name, following recommended Visual FoxPro
naming conventions:

   cmdPrev
   cmdNext
   cmdTop
   cmdEnd
   cmdFind
   cmdPrint
   cmdAdd
   cmdEdit
   cmdDelete
   cmdExit

The code for each button is contained in the class definition, not in each button
on the form. If method code is entered in an event, such as the click event,
which also has code defined in the parent class, the new code will override the
parent class code. The parent class code must be explicitly called within the
method.

You can add code to the buttons in a generated screen, as long as the code in the
parent class is called using the scope resolution operator, as in this example:

      txtbtns.cmdAdd::Click
      WAIT WINDOW "I just called the parent click code"

If you want the additional code to be processed prior to the default button
behavior, place it before the line that calls the parent method. If you want the
additional to be processed after the default button behavior, place it after the
line that calls the parent method.
