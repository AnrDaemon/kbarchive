TITLE   :Creation Time for Files in Backup May Differ from Originals
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you back up files using Microsoft Backup, the creation time for some of the
files in the backup may not match the creation time for the original files. The
creation time for some of the files in the backup may be one hour earlier or
later than the creation time for the original files.

CAUSE
=====

When you back up files, Backup uses the time returned by the file system, which
is not adjusted for Daylight Savings Time. However, Windows Explorer, and other
Windows 95 tools that display file properties, use times that are adjusted for
Daylight Savings Time. These adjusted times may differ from the non-adjusted
times by one hour at particular times during the year.
