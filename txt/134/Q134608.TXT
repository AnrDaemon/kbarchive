TITLE   :Wrong Drive Icon and Format for Removable Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The drive icon for a removable drive may be represented as a 3.5-inch floppy
disk drive instead of a removable drive. When this occurs, you cannot format the
drive using the graphical user interface (GUI) because the correct capacity for
the drive is not listed in the Capacity box in the Format dialog box. Instead,
you see only the capacities for a 3.5-inch floppy disk drive (1.44 MB and 2.88
MB).

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be caused by real-mode drivers for the removable drive in the
Config.sys file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Format the drive using the FORMAT command at an MS-DOS prompt. Also, disable the
real-mode drivers for the drive in the Config.sys file so that the drive is not
real-mode-mapped.
