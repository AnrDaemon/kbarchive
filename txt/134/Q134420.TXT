SYMPTOMS
========

When you display or paint a bitmap in App Studio or the Resource Editor, the
colors appear to be correct. However, if you close the bitmap and reopen it,
some of the colors appear to be incorrect. For example, white may appear to be
grey.

CAUSE
=====

The most common reason for this error is the video driver, usually in 64K color
mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

Switch to the standard VGA driver that ships with Windows or use a color
resolution if you need the bitmap to display correctly. You should also contact
your video card manufacturer to get a newer version of the video driver if it is
available.
