The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks and Arcada Backup Exec
Windows Workstation version 3.58 in Windows 95, you may receive one of the
following error messages:

   - There are no more connections available for this device.

   -or-

   - Drive not responding.

CAUSE
=====

There is a LASTDRIVE=Z statement in the Config.sys file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the LASTDRIVE statement from the Config.sys file.

If you must have a LASTDRIVE statement in the Config.sys file for compatibility
with an MS-DOS-based program, change the LASTDRIVE statement to a last-drive
letter less than Z. For example, the Config.sys file can contain the following
line:

   LASTDRIVE=Y

This leaves at least one drive letter at the end of the alphabet that Arcada
Backup Exec can use for temporary drive mappings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks handles drive mappings in protected
mode properly when there is no LASTDRIVE statement in the Config.Sys file, but
is bound to use the LASTDRIVE setting in the Config.Sys file if it is present.
This affects the operation of Backup Exec in the Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks.
