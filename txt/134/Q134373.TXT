 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the drop-down target list of the Visual Workbench, the Win32(80x86) Release
target is not displayed for selection under Windows 95. This problem does not
occur when running under Windows NT.

CAUSE
=====

The number of items displayed in the target drop-down list box is one less than
the total number of targets available. The one missing is usually the top most
target. If you select the top most target as the default, the bottom most target
disappears.

RESOLUTION
==========

When the target drop-down list box is in focus, press the UP ARROR or DOWN ARROW
key to move up or down in the list. The missing target will become visible, so
you can select the target for the build.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
32-bit Edition, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Problem
