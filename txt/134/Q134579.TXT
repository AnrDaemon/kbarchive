======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you dock or undock a Compaq Elite laptop computer, the computer's PCMCIA
devices may stop working. Also, multiple disabled PCMCIA controllers may appear
in Device Manager.

CAUSE
=====

Early versions of the Compaq Elite Plug and Play BIOS may report incorrect
resources for the PCMCIA controller. When this occurs, Windows 95 disables the
controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove the incorrect PCMCIA devices and install the proper one, follow these
steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

2. On the Device Manager tab, click each PCMCIA device and then click Remove.
   Remove all the PCMCIA devices.

3. Click Computer, and then click Refresh.

4. Click OK.

To prevent the problem from occurring, contact Compaq to inquire about obtaining
an updated Plug and Play BIOS dated 5/1/95 or later.
