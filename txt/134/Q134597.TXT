-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a NetWare network, your logon script may contain the
following commands:

   BREAK ON / OFF

   -or-

   VERIFY ON / OFF

But these commands, when run in the Microsoft client for NetWare networks logon
script processor, are not available in other MS-DOS windows.

CAUSE
=====

Only the MS-DOS window from which you logged on responds to the MS-DOS BREAK and
VERIFY commands after the logon script runs. MS-DOS windows you create after you
started Windows do not load the commands.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the BREAK and VERIFY commands to the Autoexec.bat file. This causes the
settings to be the default settings for each new MS-DOS window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about configuring NetWare logon scripts, consult your
NetWare documentation.
