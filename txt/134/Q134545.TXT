SYMPTOMS

When you use the Shut Down command to restart your computer, colored boxes may
appear on the screen.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you load Ssmode.exe in the Autoexec.bat file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate the restart problem, remove Ssmode.exe from the Autoexec.bat file.
Note that this resolution affects the video card's refresh rate, and may cause
the card to run in interlaced mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Ssmode.exe tool sets the refresh rate on Diamond SpeedStar 64 video cards.
Diamond has developed a Windows 95 display driver that can set the refresh rate
on these cards. To install the Diamond SpeedStar 64 display drivers, follow
these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Display icon.

2. On the Settings tab, click Change Display Type.

3. In the Adapter Type section, click Change.

4. Click the Have Disk button.

5. In the Copy Manufacturer's Files From box, type the following line and then
   press ENTER

   " <drive>:\drivers\display\diamond " (without the quotation marks)

   where <drive> is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive containing the
   Windows 95 CD-ROM.

6. In the Models box, click the model matching the video card in your computer,
   and then click OK.

7. Click Close until you are prompted to restart your computer, and then click
   Yes.

8. After Windows 95 restarts, you can select different resolutions and color
   depths using the Display tool in Control Panel.
