TITLE   :FIX: Get Displays 0 When ENTER Key Used to Move to Next Get
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An @...GET whose source contains a numeric value, changes from that numeric
value to zero when you press the ENTER key to move to the next GET. This problem
doesn't occur if you press the TAB key or use the mouse to move to the next GET.
This happens only the first time the program is run after Visual FoxPro is
opened.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use a VALID clause that does a REFRESH for the @...GET. (See the "Code to Work
Around Behavior" section in this article for an example.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro 3.0b
for Windows.
