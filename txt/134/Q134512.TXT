TITLE   :Problems Installing Hardware Drivers Across NetWare Network
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install the drivers for new hardware from a NetWare server by
clicking the Have Disk button, you may receive the message "No devices were
found."

CAUSE
=====

If an Oem.inf file exists on a user-level-security share that you have not yet
accessed, no devices are found. This occurs because the Add New Hardware Wizard
handles security differently than Windows Explorer does.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use Windows Explorer to connect to and then disconnect from the share containing
the drivers, and then set up the hardware again.
