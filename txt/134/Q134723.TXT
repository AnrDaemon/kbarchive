PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbDSupport kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to establish a connection to a remote data source using a
connection created with the Connection Designer, Visual FoxPro fails, and
displays this error message:

   Connectivity error: [Microsoft][ODBC DLL]Data Source Name Too Long

CAUSE
=====

In the Connection Designer, the Connect String was chained together using commas
instead of semi-colons.

RESOLUTION
==========

The connection string specified in the connection designer must be changed to be
chained together using semi-colons.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following connection string, if entered in the Connection Designer, fails
due to the presence of commas:

      DSN=vfpsql,USERID=sa,PASSWORD=sa,DATABASE=pubs

The correct syntax is:

      DSN=vfpsql;USERID=sa;PASSWORD=sa;DATABASE=pubs

Additional query words: 3.00 VFoxWin ODBC
