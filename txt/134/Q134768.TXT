KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the XCOPY command, files with long filenames may not be copied.

CAUSE
=====

If the "Prevent MS-DOS-based programs from detecting Windows" option is enabled
for the MS-DOS prompt, the XCOPY command does not copy files with long
filenames.

Also, long filename support is not enabled in MS-DOS mode, Safe mode, or Command
Prompt Only mode. Note that no MS-DOS command will move a file with a long
filename in MS-DOS mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the "Prevent MS-DOS-based programs from detecting Windows" option is enabled
for the MS-DOS prompt, follow these steps to disable it:

1. Use the right mouse button to click the MS-DOS Prompt icon, and then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

2. On the Program tab, click the Advanced button.

3. Click the "Prevent MS-DOS-based programs from detecting Windows" check box to
   clear it.

4. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Do not manipulate long filenames outside of Windows 95. When you boot to a
command prompt, support for long filenames is not enabled.
