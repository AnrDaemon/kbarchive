SYMPTOMS
========

On some Cirrus Logic-based laptops, Extended Video (VESA) programs may not
display correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate the display problems, run the VESA programs in Single MS-DOS
Application Mode. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt on
   the menu that appears.

2. In the MS-DOS Prompt dialog box, click the Properties button.

3. In the MS-DOS Prompt Properties dialog box, click the Program tab, and then
   click the Advanced button.

4. In the Advanced Program Settings dialog box, make sure the MS-DOS Mode box is
   checked, and then click the OK button.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Typically, a VESA program is displayed only on the top half of the screen,
overlapping itself. The program generally remains functional, and you are able
to quit the program properly.
