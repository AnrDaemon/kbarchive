SUMMARY
=======

There are cases where a developer needs to be able to determine programmatically
which database contains the table that is open. The CURSORGETPROP() function,
with 'DATABASE' (including the quotation marks) as the first parameter, returns
this information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The CURSORGETPROP() function returns the settings of various properties of a
Visual FoxPro table or cursor. For example, to determine the database to which a
table belongs, you can use this code:

      USE customer
      WAIT WINDOW "The table in the current workarea is contained by " + ;
         CURSORGETPROP('DATABASE') + ' database'

Following is a list of all the properties for which CURSORGETPROP() returns
settings:

BatchUpdateCount
Buffering
ConnectHandle
ConnectName
Database
FetchMemo
FetchSize
KeyFieldList
MaxRecords
SendUpdates
SourceName
SourceType
