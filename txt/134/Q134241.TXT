KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows 95 on an IBM ValuePoint DX4-100 computer, a PCI bus is
displayed with a red "X" in Device Manager. The PCI bus is displayed in Device
Manager even though the computer does not have a PCI bus.

CAUSE
=====

IBM ValuePoint DX4-100 computers have a mother/daughter board layout instead of
the standard motherboard layout. This configuration causes Windows 95 to
incorrectly detect a PCI bus in the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Add New Hardware icon.

3. Click Next, click the No option button, then click Next.

4. In the Hardware Types box, click System Devices, then click Next.

5. If your ValuePoint computer contains one or more VL-bus slots, click "ISA
   Plug and Play bus with VL slots." If your computer does not contain any
   VL-bus slots, click "ISA Plug and Play bus."

6. Click Next.

7. Click Finish.
