PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet msnets win95 win98 kb3rdPartyNetClient

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Windows real-mode networking services, the commands NET LOGON
or NET START WORKSTATION load the incorrect network redirector.

CAUSE
=====

The Net.exe file contains two redirectors (VREDIR for the Microsoft Client, and
NWREDIR for the Netware Client). Windows determines which redirector to load by
checking the Preferredredir key in the registry. If this key is not set, VREDIR
is loaded by default.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the Primary Network Logon setting to ensure that the desired client is
selected. To check the Primary Network Logon setting, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Network.

3. In the Network dialog box, under Primary Network Logon, select the desired
   client, and then click OK.

This setting automatically makes the appropriate changes to the registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that the NET LOGON command does not work with NWREDIR. The NET LOGON
command is not supported with NetWare NCP servers. If you use this command with
NWREDIR, you receive the following error message:

   Error 50:You attempted an operation that cannot be performed from your
   computer or that is not supported on the specified server...
