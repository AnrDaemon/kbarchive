TITLE   :Windows NT 3.5 Service Pack 2 Does Not Detect Windows NT Version
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Windows NT 3.5 Service Pack 2 Update program (UPDATE.EXE) in
Windows NT 3.51, the following STOP error message appears when you restart
Windows NT:

   STOP: c0000139 - The procedure call point NtAllocateUuids could not be
   located in the dynamic link library NTDLL.DLL

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 3.5 Service Pack 2 should only be applied to Windows NT version 3.5.
The Windows NT 3.5 Service Pack 2 UPDATE.EXE does not detect if you are
attempting to install over Windows NT version 3.51.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you must upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 again. The
Emergency Repair Disk cannot salvage the Windows NT 3.51 system since the
registry information for the operating system version has been changed to
Windows NT 3.5 Service Pack 2. The Repair process for Windows NT looks for the
operating system version.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 Service
Pack 2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
