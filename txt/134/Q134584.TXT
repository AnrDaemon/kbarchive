TITLE   :Second PCMCIA Network Adapter Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up Windows 95, Windows 95 will not install more than one PCMCIA
network adapter correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 32-bit socket drivers are not enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the Windows 95 32-Bit PCMCIA Socket drivers. To do so, follow these
steps:

1. Double-click My Computer.

2. Double-click Control Panel.

3. Start the 32-bit PC Card (PCMCIA) wizard, and follow the instructions on the
   screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 setup preserves the 16 bit network configuration of PCMCIA devices.
However the Windows95 network client only provides support for one 16 bit
network. Because of this, only one PCMCIA network card will function correctly
until 32 bit pcmcia support is unenabled. To enable 32 bit network support query
on 'enable 32 bit PCMCIA'.


NOTE: Microsoft Windows 95 is specifically designed to detect and install only
one PCMCIA network card during setup. While it is possible to install multiple
PCMCIA network cards during setup manually, following the steps above ensures
the adapter works properly.
