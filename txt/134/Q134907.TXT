PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the SNA Server 2.11 AFTP Server service is configured to require conversation
security, an AFTP client attempts to log on and provides an invalid password,
and a new valid logon attempt immediately follows, the AFTP server fails to
accept additional client login requests.

CAUSE
=====

This failure occurs due to a timing problem within the SNA Server AFTP server
service.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the files AFTPAPI.DLL, AFTP.EXE, and AFTPSERV.EXE to
correct this problem.

To work around this problem, stop and start the AFTPD service.

To disable the use of conversation security with the AFTP server service to
prevent the problem:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AFTPD\Parameters:

3. Set the following configuration parameter:

   ConversationSecurity: REG_SZ: NO
