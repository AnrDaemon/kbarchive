KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a file in Adobe Photoshop version 2.5, you may receive a general
protection fault.

CAUSE
=====

Adobe Photoshop tries to access internal, undocumented data structures in the
Windows 95 core graphics interface (GDI). Because these structures are internal,
they have changed since Windows version 3.1 to support new Windows 95 features,
such as increased system limits, better performance, and so on. Adobe Photoshop
is unable to parse the new structures properly, and this causes the general
protection fault.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact the program's vendor for the latest version of Adobe Photoshop.
