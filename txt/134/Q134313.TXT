Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

1. Create a new .dbf file called Junk with a logical field named Logic.

2. Enter two or three records with True (.T.) valuses in the Logic field and two
   or three records with False (.F.) values in the Logic field.

3. Issue the following command in the Command window:

      CREATE FORM Test

4. Select the command button object from the Form Controls toolbar, and place it
   on the form.

5. In the Refresh property for th command button, type:

      THIS.VISIBLE=Junk.Logic

   This will cause the object to be visible or not visible based upon the value
   in the Junk.dbf table.

6. Create another command button on the form.

7. Double-click the button and in the click event for this button, type the
   following two commands:

      SKIP              && move the record pointer
      THISFORM.REFRESH  && refresh the screen

8. Click the exclamation mark on the toolbar to save and run the form.

9. Click the second command button and note how the first command button appears
   and disappears based on the value of the logical field in the table.
