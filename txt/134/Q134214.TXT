TITLE   :PRB: Form Won't Scroll When Selecting Item Beyond Design Area
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When working in the Form Designer, it may be necessary to reduce the size of the
form design area to create space for other items on the screen, such as the
properties sheet. If the screen is densely populated, some of the form objects
will not be visible.

When trying to select all objects on the form by dragging the object selection
outline over the objects, the outline will stop at the edge of the visible
design area. The expected behavior is that the outline should automatically
scroll down to the area occupied by objecs on the non-visible part of the
screen, which is the functionality that exists in FoxPro version 2.x.

WORKAROUND
==========

To select all the objects on the screen, hold down the SHIFT key and click each
screen object one by one, or on the Edit menu, click Select All.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add a table to the Data environment, and place several text objects at
   various places on the form - that is, at the top, bottom, and sides of the
   form.

3. Reduce the visible working area of the Form Designer, making some of the
   objects invisible.

4. Starting at the top of the form, try to select all objects on the form by
   using the outline. Note that the field selection outline cannot go beyond the
   visible design area.
