The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you set up the Windows 3.x SNA Client over Novell's IPX/SPX stack and a
3rd party product such as Netsoft's Midrange Bundle, you can not run multiple
sessions or can only run a limited number of sessions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To configure for multiple sessions, change your NET.CFG file as follows to
increase sessions and reduce the number of read buffers that SNA Client uses.

NOTE: The following information is base on a Windows 3.1 computer using Novell's
VLM's and Netsoft's Midrange Bundle. These changes allowed an increase in the
number of sessions that could be run at one time from 5 to 15 on the client.

In the [WNAP] section of the WIN.INI file add the following line:

"SPXReadBuffers = 2" (without the quotation marks)

In NET.CFG file, add the following:

"Protocol Stack IPX
IPX Sockets = 40
SPX Connections = 50" (without the quotation marks)
