TITLE   :PPT7: Embedded Object Resizes if Slide Formatted as Title Master
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbole

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you embed an object through one of the OLE object placeholders in an
AutoLayout and then add a Title master to your presentation, the embedded object
resizes if its slide is formatted as a Title slide.

CAUSE
=====

In this situation, when you change the AutoLayout, PowerPoint mistakes the OLE
object placeholder for the sub-title placeholder. The OLE object takes on the
size and positioning of the sub-title placeholder.

NOTE: OLE objects that are not created from AutoLayout placeholders are not
affected.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the object resizes and moves, you can drag it back to its original position
and resize it by dragging the resize handles.

Additional query words: 7.00 shrink downsize
