The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you add a NetWare domain and NetWare servers to a Systems Management
Server site, the login scripts are not modified when "Automatically
Configure Logon Scripts" is selected if the system login script does not
exist.

For NetWare domains, the system login scripts for all the domains' NetWare
file servers are modified to run Client Setup and Inventory Agent. If the
NetWare system login script does not exist, Systems Management Server fails
to complete this task.

Systems Management Server looks for the NET$LOG.DAT file in the \PUBLIC
subdirectory of the SYS volume, and modifies this file to include Systems
Management Server Setup and Inventory Agent. If this file is not present,
Systems Management Server cannot complete the requested login script
modifications.
