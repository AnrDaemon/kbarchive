TITLE   :Run Command on Start Menu Does Not Accept Redirection or Pipes

SYMPTOMS
========

When you type a command that contains the pipe symbol (|) or the redirection
symbols (< or > or >>) in the Open box of the Run command, the
command is not carried out. For example, if you type the following line

   " MEM | MORE " (without the quotation marks)

you receive the following error message:

   Parse error 4

CAUSE
=====

Pipes and redirections are handled by Command.com and not by the Run command on
the Start menu. If you type a pipe or redirection symbol in the Open box of the
Run command, the symbol is given to the program as a command-line parameter.

In the example above, the MEM program is given a command line of "| more" and
encounters the parse error because "| more" is not a valid switch.

WORKAROUND
==========

To pass pipes and redirections to a program, invoke Command.com explicitly by
typing a line such as the following:

   " COMMAND.COM /c MEM | MORE " (without the quotation marks)
