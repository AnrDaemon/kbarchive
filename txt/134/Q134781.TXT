TITLE   :PPT7: Duplicate Clip Art in ClipArt Gallery
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbsetup kbclip

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install PowerPoint for Windows 95 on a computer that has an earlier
version of PowerPoint, some clip art may be duplicated.

CAUSE
=====

Because PowerPoint 4.0 contains some clip art not available in PowerPoint 7.0,
when you upgrade from version 4.0 to 7.0, the version 4.0 clip art is not
removed. Since some of the images that ship with PowerPoint 7.0 are the same as
the ones that ship with PowerPoint 4.0, you will have some duplicate thumbnails
in your ClipArt Gallery.

This problem is also caused by having PowerPoint 4.0 in a different folder than
PowerPoint 7.0, which causes PowerPoint to find more than one of the same PCS
file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Search the hard disk to find all the PCS files and remove any duplicate PCS
files, keeping any unique PCS filenames. Then refresh the ClipArt Gallery in the
folder that holds the PCS files.
