The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use Microsoft Flight Simulator with the Panasonic KXL-D720
CD-ROM drive, you receive the following error message when you attempt to read
or access the compact disc:

   Not Ready Error Reading Drive

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs because the Panasonic drive does not recognize the
Flight Simulator disc as a valid compact disc.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, contact Panasonic Technical Support for information on
obtaining a firmware upgrade.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Like most CD-ROM drives, the Panasonic KXL-D720 is calibrated to the installed
compact disc. The KXL-D720 does this by moving the read head 3.5 millimeters
from the center and reading the address mark on the disc.

The Panasonic KXL-D720 fine tunes the position of the head until the correct
address mark is read. No data exists on the Microsoft Flight Simulator compact
disc at the 3.5-millimeter mark (location) and, therefore, no address mark
exists. The error occurs because the CD-ROM drive cannot be calibrated to that
location.
