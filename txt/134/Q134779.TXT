======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 or 3.5 print server, the print job
is always listed as "Remote Downlevel Document" in the print queue.

-or-

When you print from an MS-DOS-based program to a Windows NT 3.51 print server,
the print job is always listed as "Remote Downlevel Document" in the print
queue.

CAUSE
=====

When Windows 95 prints to a Windows NT print server, Windows NT names the print
job "Remote Downlevel Document" and returns this name to Windows 95 when the
print job is enumerated.


RESOLUTION
==========

If you do not want your print jobs from Windows-based programs labeled this way,
upgrade your Windows NT print server to version 3.51.

There is currently no workaround for MS-DOS-based programs printing to a Windows
NT 3.51 print server.
