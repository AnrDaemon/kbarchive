TITLE   :FIX: Label Text Box Accepts Too Many Characters Without Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you follow the process described in the next paragraph to enter a label
longer than 255 characters, you end up losing the characters at the end of the
label or the system may cause a fault and cause Visual FoxPro to quit.

This problem occurs when on the Tools menu, you click Options. Then you click the
Control tab, enter a string longer than 255 characters in the label, and click
the check mark button. You may see an error message when you click the Set as
Default button.

CAUSE
=====

The Visual FoxPro version 3.0 program code that displays the keystrokes that
enter the label string in the text box does not check for string length.

WORKAROUND
==========

Enter only the characters needed for the label, and pre-determine that the text
string has 255 or fewer characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro 3.0b
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A caption entered in a property sheet text box is limited to 255 characters.
Characters beyond that number are not accepted in the text box.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Visual FoxPro.

2. In the Command window, enter this command:

      CREATE CLASSLIB mylib

3. In the Command window enter the following command to bring up the Forms
   Designer and its menu bar:

      MODIFY FORM test

4. On Tools menu, click Options.

5. Click the Controls tab.

6. Click the Add command button. Select mylib from the dialog box.

7. Click the Label box and enter a character string longer than 255 characters.

8. Click the check mark button to accept the label entry. The label replaces the
   line mylib in the list box at the left, or the label in the list box is
   empty.

9. Click the Set as Default button at the bottom of the pageset. If this does
   not cause a Win32s fault, go on to step 10.

10. On the Forms Controls toolbar, click the Class Library tool. The label you
   entered has become the name of the Class Library. It does not contain all of
   the characters that were entered.
