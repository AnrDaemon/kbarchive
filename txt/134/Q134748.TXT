SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how NDIS 2 PCMCIA drivers must load and bind in real mode
to work in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not include NDIS 2 or ODI drivers for PCMCIA cards in Windows 95.
You must obtain the correct real-mode or NDIS 2 drivers from the card's
manufacturer.

Windows 95 support for NDIS 2 protocols is the same as in Windows for Workgroups
3.11. An NDIS 2 protocol driver must use an NDIS 2 network adapter driver.

Both the protocol drivers and the network adapter drivers must load and bind in
real mode before Windows 95 starts. As with protected-mode network components,
real-mode network components in Windows 95 use the registry for configuration
and binding information. Earlier versions of Microsoft real-mode network
components, such as those included with Windows for Workgroups, use the
Protocol.ini file for configuration and binding information.
