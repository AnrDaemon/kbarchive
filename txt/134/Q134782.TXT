 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you embed a PowerPoint slide into an external document (for example, a Word
for Windows 95 document) and then print it to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4
(or compatible) printer, some fills print incorrectly:

 - Semi-transparent and shaded fills print as rectangles around the filled
   object.

   -and-

 - Textured (and picture) fills print a solid black.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: These steps are for the HP LaserJet 4 printer driver, version 3.78,
Universal Printer Driver, 4.00. Because there are several versions of the HP
printer driver, the following steps may be different for your printer. If they
are, please consult your product documentation to complete these steps.

To resolve this problem, change the printer's properties to use raster graphics:

1. On the File menu, click Print.

2. Click Properties.

3. Click the Graphics tab, and then click User Raster Graphics.

4. Click OK.
