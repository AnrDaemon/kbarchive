TITLE   :Cannot Synchronize Files with Briefcase After Moving
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95 4.00

KEYWORDS:win95

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you move a Briefcase to another computer on the network, the Briefcase may
not be able to update files that require updating. When this occurs, you may
receive an error message stating that the synchronization copy is unavailable,
even though the file is actually available on the network.

CAUSE
=====

When you drag a file into the Briefcase, information such as the Universal
Naming Convention (UNC) path, volume label, and path are stored in the database.
This information is refreshed in the database whenever the Briefcase is opened.

If a file is not accessible with a UNC path name at the time that it is dropped
into the Briefcase, UNC information is not stored for that file. If you later
share a folder above the original file, the new UNC information is not
propagated to the Briefcase database until you open the Briefcase.

If you move the Briefcase to another computer before the UNC path is refreshed in
the database, no UNC path is carried to the new computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure to open the Briefcase at least once after the file is made available
with a UNC path before moving the Briefcase to another computer.
