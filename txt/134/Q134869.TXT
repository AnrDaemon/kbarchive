TITLE   :PPT7: Header or Footer Text Runs into Date or Slide Number
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you include a footer on a PowerPoint slide, the footer text may run into
the slide number and/or the date.

CAUSE
=====

Text boxes on the Slide Master control the preset locations of the date, footer,
and slide number. These are provided for easy access and formatting. If you
enter too much text in the footer box, the text may collide with the text from
the date and/or slide number boxes if they are also present.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, click Slide Master on the View menu, and then move
or resize the date, slide number, header, and footer placeholders.

REFERENCES
==========

For more information about formatting text frames, click Contents And Index on
the Help menu, click the Index tab in PowerPoint Help, type the following text

   "resizing objects" (without the quotation marks)

double-click the selected text, and then double-click "Resize or crop an object"
to go to the "Resize or crop an object" topic.
