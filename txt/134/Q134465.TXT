TITLE   :PRB: "File Access Denied" Using Grid or AutoFormat Builders
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

One of the following two symptoms occurs:

 - Selecting the Style tab in the Grid Builder results in this error:

   Error #1705 in Getstyles (0): File access is denied.

   -or-

 - Calling the AutoFormat Builder results in this error:

   Error #1705 in Load (0): File access is denied.

   This error is followed by this information:

   'WBASTYLES' is not an array.
   Program: wbcall
   Line: (0) wboName = CREATEOBJ(THIS.wbcName, &cParmstring)
   <Abort> <Retry> <Ignore>

CAUSE
=====

The Wizards directory is Read-only. This may occur on an Administrative
Installation when users are running Visual FoxPro from the Network and are
calling the Builders, but they do not have Write or Create access to the
directories.

WORKAROUND
==========

The network administrator, or a user with Write and Create rights for the Visual
FoxPro directories, should log on, start Visual FoxPro, and call the Grid and
AutoFormat builders to create the tables that needed for these Builders. The
tables need only be created once.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Style tab of the Grid Builder attempts to create the following files in the
Visual FoxPro Wizards directory:

      GRIDSTYL.DBF
      GRIDSTYL.FPT

The AutoFormat Builder attempts to create the following files in the Visual
FoxPro Wizards directory:

      CTRLSTYL.DBF
      CTRLSTYL.FPT

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------
