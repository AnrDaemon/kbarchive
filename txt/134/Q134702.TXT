TITLE   :PRB: "VFP300.ESL: Error Code=0" Error Occurs When Running .EXE
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a distributable Visual FoxPro .EXE file, this error occurs:

   VFP300.ESL: Error Code=0

This error message is followed by an unhandled exception detected error.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows swap file is too small or the machine has 8 MB of RAM. NOTE: This
error message occurs only on 16-bit operating systems such as Windows version
3.1.

WORKAROUND
==========

If your machine has at least 8 MB of RAM, increase the Windows virtual memory
settings. If it has 8 MB of RAM, consider adding more RAM to your machine.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install Microsoft Visual FoxPro on 16-bit operating systems (such as
Windows version 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups version 3.11), Visual FoxPro
installs the Win32s subsystem. Win32s requires a minimum swap file size of 10
megabytes. Visual FoxPro distributable .EXE files have the same system
requirements as Visual FoxPro.

To increase virtual memory:

1. Open the Windows Control Panel, and select the 386 Enhanced icon.

2. Click the Virtual Memory button.

3. Click the Change button.

4. Recommended Swap File settings for Visual FoxPro are swap file of at least
   10,000K. This is documented in the Visual FoxPro Installation Guide and
   Master Index page 2. Permanent swap files require contiguous space, a utility
   such as DEFRAG.EXE, that ships with MS-DOS version 6.x may be used to
   defragment the drive and offer larger permanent swap file sizes.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a Visual FoxPro distributable .EXE file.

2. If necessary, run the Setup Wizard to create distribution disks for the
   application.

3. Install the application on a 16-bit Windows platform such as Windows version
   3.1.

4. Change the virtual memory settings on the computer so that a swap file of
   512K is created.

5. After restarting Windows, attempt to execute the distributable .EXE file. At
   this point, the error occurs.
