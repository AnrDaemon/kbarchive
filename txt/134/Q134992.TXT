TITLE   :MODE Command: "Printer Output Is Not Being Rerouted"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using the MODE command (a command line redirector for MS-DOS-based
applications) to map a printer on a COM port to an LPT port, the following error
may occur:

   Status for device LPT1:
   Printer Output is not being rerouted

This error occurs even though the following correct syntax is used at the command
prompt:

   MODE LPTn:=COMm:

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the network redirector instead of the MODE
command. For example, create and share a printer. At the MS-DOS prompt, type the
NET USE command to map the appropriate port to the share UNC name, as in the
following example:

   NET USE LPT1: \\server\printshare

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
