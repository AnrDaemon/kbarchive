SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the file compare command, Fc.exe, and you use wildcards in the
second argument of the command, the Fc.exe command reports that there is no such
file or directory.

For example, if you have two files in a directory, one named a_long_file_name and
the other named a_really_long_file_name, when you carry out the command

   fc a_long_file_name a_really_*

the fc command reports

   Comparing files a_long_file_name and a_really_le_name
   FC:cannot open a_really_le_name - No such file or directory

instead of the expected action of comparing the a_long_file_name file to the
a_really_long_file_name file.

CAUSE
=====

When you use wildcards in the second argument, the Fc.exe command matches the
second argument against the first argument instead of matching the files in the
current directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Type the second argument in full if you do not intend to match the second
argument against the first argument.
