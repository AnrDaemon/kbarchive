PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on to Windows NT server from a Macintosh client
computer, the following error message appears:

   This file server does not use a recognizable log on sequence.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs under the following conditions:

 - "Require Microsoft Authentication" is enabled and "Allow Guests to Logon" is
   disabled for MacFile Attributes in the Control Panel MacFile Properties
   dialog box.

   -and-

 - The Macintosh does not have the Microsoft user authentication module (UAM)
   installed, or the UAM is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. On the Windows NT server, run Control Panel, choose MacFile Properties, and
   select "Allow Guests to Logon." From the Macintosh client computer, connect
   to the Microsoft UAM Volume on the Windows NT server using the guest account.

2. Copy the entire AppleShare folder into your system folder. If the folder
   already exists, copy the Microsoft UAM. For more information, read Chapter 4
   "Setting Up Services for Macintosh Client Software" in the Windows NT
   Services for Macintosh Guide.

3. You can now disable "Allow Guests to Logon" if you want.
