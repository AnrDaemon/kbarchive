KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows 95, the MS-DOS version of ScanDisk does not operate.
When you try to start ScanDisk from the DOS directory, you receive one of the
following error messages:

   This version of Microsoft SCANDISK will work only with MS-DOS versions 6.0
   and later.

   This version of Microsoft SCANDISK will work only on MS-DOS versions 6 and
   6.20.

CAUSE
=====

Setup leaves the MS-DOS version of ScanDisk in the DOS directory for backwards
compatibility, but this version of ScanDisk does not run in Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run ScanDisk from the Windows\Command folder, or run it by clicking the Start
button, pointing to Programs, pointing to Accessories, pointing to System Tools,
and then clicking ScanDisk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can run the version of ScanDisk in the DOS directory only if you boot your
computer to your previous version of MS-DOS. We do not recommend that you do
this because running the MS-DOS version of ScanDisk from the DOS directory can
damage long filenames.
