SYMPTOMS
========

When you are creating a Startup Disk during Windows 95 Setup, you may receive
the following error message:

   Disk Initialization Error
   Could not properly initialize the floppy disk that you inserted.
   Error: Disk sector was not found.
   Click OK to continue.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the floppy disk drive in your computer is connected to
a Promise IDE controller. The hardware detection portion of Setup does not
properly recognize floppy disk drives on a Promise IDE controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not create a Startup Disk during Setup. Instead, create a Startup Disk after
Setup is finished by following these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

3. Click the Startup Disk tab.

4. Click the Create Disk button.
