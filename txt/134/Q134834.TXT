TITLE   :PRB: SourceSafe Fails with Norton Desktop Version 3.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose the Add command from SourceSafe's SourceSafe menu, or press the
CTRL+Y key combination to add a file to a project, SourceSafe may close
unexpectedly without generating any error messages.

CAUSE
=====

These symptoms may occur if you are running Norton Desktop version 3.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two alternates: disable Norton Desktop for Windows by:

1. Using any ASCII text editor such as Microsoft Notepad, open the SYSTEM.INI
   file located in the Windows directory.

2. Locate the SHELL = NDW.EXE line and turn it into a comment by inserting a
   semicolon as the first character of the line.

3. Insert a new line immediately following the SHELL = NDW.EXE line that reads
   SHELL = PROGMAN.EXE.

4. Close and save the new SYSTEM.INI file. Restart Windows.

As an alternative, you can search for all copies of CTL3DV2.DLL and keep only the
version that ships with SourceSafe 3.0. The conflict is with the newer
CTL3DV2.DLL v 2.29.0.0 and Norton Desktop.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

NOTE: Norton Desktop is manufactured by Symantec, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
