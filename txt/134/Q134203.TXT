SUMMARY
=======

With versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, programmers may
create their own Windows interfaces to the postoffice using the Simple Messaging
Applications Programmer's Interface (MAPI). With Microsoft Visual C++ version
1.5, 2.0, or 2.1, programmers may run into the typical "name mangling" problem
during the link process that affects C++ programs linking DLLs created by a C
compiler.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Programmers may solve this "name mangling" problem by changing the way the
MAPI.H header file is included in the Visual C++ program. Instead of the
standard include:

      #include "mapi.h"

Programmers should use the following:

      extern "C" {
      #include "mapi.h"
      }

Using the "extern" keyword in such a manner tells the Visual C++ compiler to link
the MAPI.DLL library correctly and resolves problems with "name mangling".
