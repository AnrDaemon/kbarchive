SYMPTOMS
========

After you convert an uncompressed drive that is almost full to a compressed
drive using DriveSpace, you may receive the following error message when you run
ScanDisk:

   The ratio that Windows is using to estimate the amount of free space
   available on this drive is too high. As a result, Windows reports that your
   disk contains more free space than it actually does. To change the ratio,
   click the help button, and then carry out the procedure for changing your
   compression ratio.

CAUSE
=====

The DriveSpace conversion tool automatically sets the estimated compression
ratio to 2:1. In some rare cases, this ratio is too high.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow the instructions on the screen to change the
compression ratio.
