TITLE   :Thrustmaster Joystick Fails Control Panel Test
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install a ThrustMaster F-16 FLCS joystick using the Joystick
tool in Control Panel, the joystick fails the tests performed by Windows 95.
When you are finished installing it, the joystick does not function properly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the joystick is connected to a ThrustMaster Mark I
Weapons Control System (WCS) device, rather than directly to the computer
itself. Mark I WCS configurations are not supported by the Windows 95
protected-mode joystick driver (Vjoyd.vxd).

RESOLUTION
==========

Connect the joystick directly to the computer, rather than to the Mark I WCS
device.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Thrustmaster joystick has been produced with a ThrustMaster Mark I Weapons
Control System (WCS) and a ThrustMaster Mark II Weapons Control System (WCS).
The Mark II Weapons Control System (WCS) works with Windows 95, but the Mark I
Weapons Control System (WCS) does not. For more information contact,
ThrustMaster.
