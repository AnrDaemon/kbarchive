TITLE   :Setup Cannot Find Previous Version of Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to upgrade an exiting Windows NT installation to Windows NT 3.5
or 3.51, an error may appear stating that Windows NT Setup could not find an
existing version of Windows NT. You can only exit Setup or install Windows NT
into a new directory.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Setup looks for SCSI instead of MULTI in the
BOOT.INI file.

Setup fails to find standard Windows NT 3.1 installations that have SCSI in the
BOOT.INI file, and fails to find Windows NT 3.5 installations where you have
changed the MULTI references to SCSI in the BOOT.INI file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add a extra line in the BOOT.INI file that points
to the install to be upgraded. Use MULTI instead of SCSI.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and 3.51
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
