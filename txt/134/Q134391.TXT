The Visual C++ documentation contains information about ODBC and the MFC Database
classes, and it supplies the ENROLL tutorial, which demonstrates how to use the
classes.

The Microsoft Developer Knowledge Base on the Microsoft Developer Network CD-ROM
(MSDN) and Microsoft's world-wide web site on the internet, includes articles
that give tips and talk about problems, bugs, and general issues concerning the
Microsoft Database classes and ODBC. For example, to search for all of the
articles about the MFC ODBC database classes, search the Microsoft Knowledge
Base using the keyword MfcDatabase.

The latest version of the ODBC SDK and Programmer's Reference version 3.5 can be
