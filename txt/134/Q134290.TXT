-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 1.0, 1.05, 1.2, 1.3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you forward a bulletin board (BBS) message by e-mail, attached files are
not forwarded.

CAUSE
=====

Files attached to BBS messages are stored in rich text format (RTF). When you
forward or reply to a message by e-mail, the BBS uses Simple MAPI. Simple MAPI
does not support RTF. For this reason, attached files are not forwarded.

STATUS
======

This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
release.

Additional query words: 1.2 msn email
