SYMPTOMS
========

When a Novell/Anthem NE3200 EISA Ethernet Adapter is configured to start using
NE3200.DOS (the NDIS2 driver) in the Autoexec.bat file, you may receive the
following error message when NET START /VERBOSE runs:

   M0026: Failed to find controller -- Controller not present

After this error message, you receive the following error message:

   Error 5733: The protocol manager has reported an incomplete binding

NOTE: You see the error messages only if you bypass the Windows 95 logo splash
screen and NET START is used with the /VERBOSE switch.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the NE3200 NDIS3 driver. For information about
how to install the NDIS3 drivers, click the Index tab in Windows 95 Help, type
the following text

   adapters

and then double-click "adapters, adding or changing the driver for."

If you still need to use the NDIS2 driver in Windows, ignore the error messages
or remove the /VERBOSE switch from the NET START line in the Autoexec.bat file.

NOTE: To use the NDIS2 driver outside of the Windows environment, you must start
the computer using a previous version of MS-DOS.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Even when you receive this error message, you still have full networking
functionality in Windows. No functionality is lost while you are in the Windows
95 graphical interface (GUI). The failure to bind occurs when you start in
MS-DOS mode.
