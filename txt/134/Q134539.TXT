you may receive the following error messages:

 - When you select Historical Overview:

The "Incorrect DOS version" error messages may be replaced by "Bad command or
file name" error messages.

CAUSE
=====

The compact disc version of the program uses MS-DOS utilities that are no longer
part of Windows 95. You may receive the "Incorrect DOS version" error messages
if you still have an older MS-DOS version installed on the computer, in which
case the old version is run by mistake. You may receive the "Bad command or file
name" error messages if you have no previous version of MS-DOS installed on the
computer, or if Windows 95 cannot find it.
