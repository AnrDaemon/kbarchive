SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the tasks Program Group Control (PGC) performs during
startup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PGC checks the following during startup:

1. Detect new shared applications and make them available.

   During PGC startup, PGC checks the NAD database for any new shared
   applications and program groups. PGC updates its internal data structures in
   the registry for the new items.

2. Detect obsolete shared applications and remove them.

   If the NADNAME (shared application ID) is no longer valid (there is no
   corresponding entry in the NAD database), then the application is removed
   from PGC internal data structures. If the NADNAME is valid, but refers to a
   different application, then the internal entry is obsolete, and needs to be
   removed also.

3. Remove references to shared applications for users who do not have permission
   for them.

   If the user does not have permission for an application, the deinstall program
   specified in the PDF is run to remove it from the "insert object" dialog
   menus. Likewise, when it is discovered that the user does have permission for
   an application that was previously denied, the application objects is placed
   back into the "insert object" dialogs.

4. Make and update program groups and icons for the shared applications.

   Every time that PGC starts up, it verifies all the program groups and icons
   which have been assigned. If there are any new groups or items, they are
   added. If items are removed, the corresponding groups and items are deleted.
