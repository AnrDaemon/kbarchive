   4. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider one notch to the left.

   5. Click OK.

   6. Click Close. When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.

 - Reduce the color palette to 16 colors. To do so, follow these steps:

   1. Use the right mouse button to click an open area of the desktop, and then
      click Properties on the menu that appears.

   2. Click the Settings tab.

   3. In the Color Palette box, click 16 Color.

   4. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

STATUS
