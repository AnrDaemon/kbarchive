======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51

SYMPTOMS

After you install Windows NT and run Disk Administrator for the first time, the
"Disk administrator is initializing" screen appears but you never see the Disk
Administrator Window. When you attempt to run Disk Administrator again:

   Disk Administrator is already running.

CAUSE

This problem occurs when Disk Administrator displays a dialog box that states it
is going to write a disk signature, but the dialog box appears behind Program
Manager.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, press ALT+TAB to switch to the Disk Administrator
dialog box.
