SYMPTOMS
========

When you are signing up for MSN, The Microsoft Network and downloading telephone
numbers, you may receive the following error message:

   No longer connected to The Microsoft Network. Please try to connect again.

The message disappears after a few seconds and the screen asking "Do you want
full Internet access?" is displayed. After you click Yes or No and click OK, the
access number screen is displayed. The telephone numbers shown are the sign-up
numbers (toll-free 1-800 numbers).

CAUSE

The connection to MSN was broken before the updated phone book was completely
downloaded.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, run the MSN sign-up program again. To do so, follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "signup.exe" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click OK. Allow the sign-up program to dial in using the 1-800 number.

3. Click Change and then select access numbers for your area.

NOTE: It is important that you select access numbers. You cannot sign in to MSN
using the sign-up numbers.
