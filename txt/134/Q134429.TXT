The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

You may not be able to print to a printer that is connected to a computer
running the Workgroups Add-On for MS-DOS version 3.11, even though you can
successfully connect to shared resources on that computer.

Printing to the printer from WordPad may result in the following error message:

   There was an error writing to \\<server>\<printer> for
   "<printer name>": The network printer is no longer available. Contact
   your system administrator or try using a different printer. This printer will
   be set to work offline. To save your print job in the local printer queue,
   click OK.

If you then attempt to set the printer to work online, the following error
message is displayed:

   Cannot connect to this network printer. Make sure your network is working
   properly and the network share you are connected to exists.

CAUSE
=====

The computer that the printer is connected to is configured to use the basic
redirector. The Workgroups Add-On for MS-DOS uses the basic redirector by
default.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, configure the computer to use the full redirector by
following these steps:

1. From an MS-DOS prompt, change to the Workgroups Add-On for MS-DOS directory,
   then type "setup" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

2. Use the UP ARROW key to select Change Setup Options, and then press ENTER.

3. Use the UP ARROW key to select Change Redir Options, and then press ENTER.

4. Select Use The Full Redirector, and then press ENTER.

5. Restart the computer when prompted to do so.
