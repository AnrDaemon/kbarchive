SYMPTOMS
========

When you receive one of the following error messages in Scandisk and the error
message dialog box has only a Cancel button, you cannot close the error message
dialog box by pressing the ESC or ENTER keys:

   ScanDisk could not write to this disk because it is write protected. Remove
   the write-protect tab, reinsert the disk, and then restart ScanDisk.

   ScanDisk cannot continue because the disk it was checking was removed from the
   drive. Reinsert the disk, and then restart ScanDisk.

   The compressed volume file for this drive is too small. It must be at least
   512K in size. This may be caused by an error on your host drive, which is the
   uncompressed drive on which the compressed volume file is stored. For
   information about how to continue, click Help.

CAUSE
=====

In Scandisk, some of the error message dialog boxes that have only a Cancel
button do not have the standard keyboard shortcut associated with the button.


RESOLUTION
==========

To close the error message dialog box, do one of the following:

1. Use the mouse pointer to click the CANCEL button.

   -or-

2. Press ALT+F4.
