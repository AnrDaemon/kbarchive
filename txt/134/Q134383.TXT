The Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT (NT MMTA) is not supported
running under IBM OS/2 (any version).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NT MMTA will run successfully under IBM OS/2; however, it has not been
tested and is not supported running in this environment.

The Setup program will do a version check for Windows NT version 3.51 so it will
not install on an IBM OS/2 machine. However, it is possible to copy the
pertinent files and run the program.
