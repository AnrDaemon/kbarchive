======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOM
-------

After you upgrade from Windows NT version 3.50 to 3.51, your computer's
performance degrades significantly when you use Client Services for NetWare
(CSNW) or Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW).

This symptom occurs if your computer has a Compaq Imbedded Netflex network
interface card (NIC).


CAUSE
=====

The driver for your Netflex network card is from COMPAQ Computer Corporation and
is not an updated version, and when you upgrade Windows NT version 3.50 to 3.51,
the Netflex network card driver is not updated.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, replace your current Compaq Netflex driver with the
following driver included in Windows NT 3.51:

   AMD PCNET Family Ethernet Adapter

NOTE: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is the manufacturer of the Compaq Imbedded
Netflex network card.
