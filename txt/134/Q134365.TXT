KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the case of the placeholders on a Slide Master, it does not affect
the text on the slides.

The Slide Master holds formatted placeholders for the title and body text fields
that appear on your slides. In the placeholders for slide titles and text, you
can change the font, color, size, line spacing, and alignment of the text, as
well as the placeholder's shape, size, and placement. These changes will be
reflected in all of the slides. However, if you change the case of the title or
text in the Slide Master to anything other than sentence case (with just the
first letter of the first word capitalized), this change is not reflected in the
slides. All titles and text in the slides default to sentence case.

CAUSE
=====

You can use the Slide Master placeholders to change the character and paragraph
attributes of slide text. You cannot use the Slide Master placeholders to change
the actual text that appears on your slides. The Change Case command does not
change character or paragraph attributes. Instead, it physically replaces
lowercase letters with uppercase letters or vice versa. The Change Case command
works only on the text that is selected when the command is executed.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to change the case of text, you have to select it before running the
Change Case command. You can select it from either Slide View or Outline View.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have PowerPoint 7.0 you can also use the Style Checker to change the case
of slide text automatically. For more information about changing capitalization,
click the Index tab in PowerPoint Help, type the following text

   "capitalization" (without the quotation marks)

and then double-click "Change capitalization" to go to the "Change
Capitalization" topic.
