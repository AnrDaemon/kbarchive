PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, the messages may
not leave the Outbox when you choose Connect Now with the send messages option
selected.

NOTE: The messages may leave the Outbox on subsequent attempts.

If you enable extended logging with Windows Remote, you will see the following
message in the log, even though the Send option has been selected, and there is
mail in the Outbox:

   No mail to send to postoffice or requested

CAUSE
=====

This is caused if the MAI directory pointed to by CONTROL.GLB in
WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT\GLB is missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that there are 16 subdirectories MA0 through MAF under
WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT\MAI.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After a failed attempt, the CONTROL.GLB is incremented to point to the next MAI
directory. If this directory is available, mail in the Outbox will get sent
correctly.

Additional query words: 3.20
