SYMPTOMS

When you try to start Fleet Defender F14 Tomcat version 1.0 by MicroProse, you
may receive the following error message:

   F14

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be terminated. Quit
   all programs, and then restart your computer.

CAUSE
=====

Fleet Defender requires expanded memory, and will not run if no expanded memory
is available.


RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following steps to make expanded memory available for the game:

1. Use the right mouse button to click the Fleet Defender program icon, and then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

2. Click the Memory tab.

3. If the Expanded Memory box contains the message "The computer is not
   configured for expanded memory in MS-DOS sessions," click the Details button
   and follow the instructions.

4. Set the Expanded (EMS) Memory setting to Auto.

5. Click OK until the dialog box closes.

To start the program, double-click its icon instead of typing "f14" at the
command prompt.
