SUMMARY
=======

The default directory for a shared application run under Systems Management
Server cannot be set through the Administrator Tool for the application. It is,
however, possible to set a specific DOS environment variable which can be used
to point the application to a working directory.

To do this, set the SMS_WORKING_DIR to a specific path for the application. For
example, add the following to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and restart the computer:

   " set SMS_WORKING_DIR=c:\word\docs " (without the quotation marks)

Program Group Control (PGC) makes this path the current working directory when
PGC launches the shared application. When the user selects Open from the
application's File menu, the files in the c:\word\docs directory appears by
default.
