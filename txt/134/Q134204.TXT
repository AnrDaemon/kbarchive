SUMMARY
=======

When you use version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, there are times when it
may be necessary or desirable to create a new mail message file (MMF). The
following information includes steps for preserving the Personal Address Book
(PAB) part of the MMF.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a new MMF and preserve the current PAB, use the following steps:

1. Start Mail using the MMF that contains the PAB you want to export. If the MMF
   is on the server, move it locally (from the Mail menu, choose Options. Then
   select Server).

2. Create an empty folder. For this example, it will be called "EMPTY1" (without
   the quotation marks).

3. From the File menu, choose Export. Create an export folder. For this example
   it will be called "EXPORT1.MMF" (without the quotation marks).

4. Copy the empty folder (EMPTY1) to EXPORT1.MMF.

5. Exit and sign out of Mail.

6. Rename the current MMF, and Exit and Sign-out of Mail. Then restart Mail to
   create a new MMF.

7. Double-click the EXPORT1.MMF file to start Mail.

8. Mail will prompt you to make this MMF your primary message. DO NOT MAKE THIS
   MMF YOUR PRIMARY MESSAGE FILE.

9. From the File menu, choose Export. Select the new MMF you created in step 6.

10. Copy EMPTY1.

11. Exit and Sign out of Mail.

12. Restart Mail. The PAB will now be in the MMF.
