TITLE   :PRB: Invalid or Missing EXE Error When Starting Visual FoxPro
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After launching Visual FoxPro for Windows, you see this error:

   Invalid or Missing EXE

This message is displayed immediately following the Visual FoxPro logo screen.
Clicking the OK button returns control to Windows.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because of a conflict between SHARE.EXE and VSHARE.386. During
setup, Visual FoxPro installs VSHARE.386. If SHARE.EXE is already being loaded
from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, a conflict can occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

Visual FoxPro does not require SHARE.EXE to be loaded. If no other applications
on the system require SHARE.EXE, remove SHARE.EXE from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If
SHARE.EXE must be loaded, the VFP.EXE file must be marked with the read-only
attribute. This can be done either with the Attrib command, or by changing the
file properties in File Manager.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

See page 64 of the Installation Guide and Master Index for more information.
