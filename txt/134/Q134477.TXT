TITLE   :Lion King 1.0: ESS AudioDrive Hardware Not Responding
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install The Lion King version 1.0 on a computer that has an ESS 488
sound card and is running Windows 95, you may receive the following error
message:

   The ESS AudioDrive hardware is not responding properly. Sound playback and
   recording will not be available.

CAUSE
=====

There is an incompatibility between the ESS 488 16-bit driver and the 16- bit
file architecture that The Lion King employs. Although Windows Audio Compression
Manager is capable of translating 16-bit files and playing them correctly, The
Lion King does not recognize the translation and incorrectly states that the
sound card is not responding properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact the manufacturer for an upgrade of The Lion King.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur if The Lion King version 1.0 is installed in Windows
version 3.x, and then later upgraded to Windows 95.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
