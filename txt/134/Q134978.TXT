SUMMARY
=======

The DBF() function returns the full path of a table that is currently open.
Using the FULLPATH() and DBGETPROP() functions, the full path to a table in a
database can be determined without opening the table because the relative path
of the table to the location of the database is stored in the database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following commands display the full path of the Customer table in the
Testdata database. In this example, the table is in the same directory as the
database:

      OPEN DATABASE SYS(2004)+'SAMPLES\DATA\TESTDATA'
      ? FULLPATH( DBGETPROP( 'CUSTOMER' , 'TABLE' , 'PATH' ) , DBC() )

Use the following commands to create a table in a different directory from the
database, and then obtain the path of the table using the functions described.

      SET DEFAULT TO SYS(2004)+'SAMPLES\MAINSAMP'
      CREATE DATABASE test
      CREATE TABLE data\testtbl (field1 C (50))
      CLOSE ALL
      OPEN DATABASE test
      ? FULLPATH( DBGETPROP( 'TESTTBL' , 'TABLE' , 'PATH' ) , DBC() )
