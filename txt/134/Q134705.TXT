TITLE   :DOC: DBGETPROP() Returns Unexpected Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocfix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Help file topic for the DBGETPROP(cName, cType, cProperty) function states
incorrectly that when the cType is "view" and the cProperty is "tables," the
return value for the cProperty will be a comma-separated string of table names.
However, the return value in Visual FoxPro is actually a string of names
separated by spaces, not commas.

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start Visual FoxPro for Windows.

2. In the Command window, enter these commands:

      CREATE DATABASE test
      CREATE TABLE t1 (Name c(20))
      CREATE TABLE t2 (Name c(20))
      CREATE TABLE t3 (Name c(20))
      CREATE SQL VIEW testvu AS SELECT * FROM t1, t2, t3
      ? DBGETPROP("testvu","view","tables")

3. Observe that the returned value shown on the upper-left area of the desktop
   is t1 t2 t3. The Help file states that the returned value should be t1,t2,t3.
