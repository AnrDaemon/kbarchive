TITLE   :PPT7: Action Item Slides Not Written from Embedded Presentation
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbole

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can embed one presentation within another in Microsoft PowerPoint. If you
use Meeting Minder to record Action Items or Meeting Minutes while in an
embedded presentation, that information is not written to the Action Items or
Meeting Minutes slides that are generated at the end of the main presentation.

CAUSE
=====

When you show an embedded presentation object, you are playing it. In
PowerPoint, you cannot change an embedded OLE object at the same time you play
it. Therefore, you cannot add or change slides to an embedded presentation while
it is being shown.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use Meeting Minder when you are in the main portion of a presentation; do not
use it when you are in an embedded presentation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
