PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbusage kbdocerr smsdocerr

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

One of the following error messages appears after you run the Systems Management
Server Machview command:

 - Couldn't View Selected Object

-or-

 - Couldn't Execute the Given Query

CAUSE
=====

You used the incorrect command line syntax for the Machview command.

The Machview command line help incorrectly documents the syntax as follows:

   MACHVIEW machineid
   MACHVIEW /Q architechure:group:attribute=value

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the proper Machview command line syntax as follows:

machview /q "Personal Computer:MICROSOFT|IDENTIFICATION|1.0:SMSID=<smsid>"

where <smsid> is the SMSID of the client you want to query. This option is
case sensitive and the quotation marks are required.

For example, if Systems Management Server Administrator shows your computer SMSID
as SMS0002, type the Machview command as follows:

machview /q "Personal Computer:MICROSOFT|IDENTIFICATION|1.0:SMSID=SMS0002"

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
