SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print a document from Lotus Notes to a network printer, the
document is not printed.

CAUSE
=====

The printer is connected using a Uniform Naming Conventions (UNC) path. Lotus
Notes does not recognize the UNC path, and therefore cannot find the printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you use a network printer, make sure the network path is associated with a
printer port. (This is also referred to as "capturing" a printer port.)
Otherwise, when you print to a network printer from Lotus Notes, you may
encounter problems.

To capture a printer port, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers on the
   menu that appears.

2. In the Printers dialog box, using the right mouse button, click the icon for
   the printer you use, and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

3. In the Properties box for the printer, click the Details tab, and then click
   the Capture Printer Port button.

4. In the Capture Printer Port dialog box, select the port the printer is
   connected to, and then type the path to the printer.

5. In the Lotus Notes Printer Setup dialog box, select the printer you captured.
