CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions exist:

 - Your computer is infected with a virus.

 - There is a problem in the Atapi.sys driver.




RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Run anti-virus software to check for and to remove any virus.

2. If your computer is not infected with a virus, obtain and install the latest
   Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack.

To successfully install Windows NT 3.51, you must replace the Atapi.sys file on
the Windows NT CD-ROM with the expanded version of Atapi.sy_ (still compressed)
available with the latest Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack:

1. Insert the Windows NT 3.51 CD-ROM in your CD-ROM drive.

2. Copy the Windows NT 3.51 source files from the Windows NT CD-ROM to a
   temporary directory on your hard disk. For example, create a directory named
   NTFLAT, and then copy the source files to the NTFLAT directory.

3. Insert the Service Pack CD-ROM in your CD-ROM drive.

   -or-

   PKUNZIP the Windows NT v3.51 service pack in a temporary directory. To do so,
   type the following command at a command prompt:

   Pkunzip -d NT_SERVICE_PACK_NAME.ZIP c:\sptemp

4. Copy the ATAPI.SYS from the expanded service pack directory to the C:\NTFLAT
   installation directory or type the following command to expand the compressed
   Atapi.sys file on the service pack CD-ROM to the C:\NTFLAT directory:

   expand <compact_disc_drive>:\i386\atapi.sy_ c:\ntflat\atapi.sys

5. Install Windows NT 3.51 from the temporary directory by typing the following
   command at a command prompt:

   winnt /b

6. After you finish installing Windows NT V3.51, install the complete Service
   Pack.
