TITLE   :PRB: Disabled ComboBox Item Disappears
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Disabling a ComboBox list item by using the This.List(This.ListItemId)='\'
method causes the disabled item to disappear when the RowSourceType is either
STRUCTURE or VALUE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following statement, and ensure that the DisabledItemForeColor and
DisabledItemBackColor properties display the item properly:

      This.List(This.ListItemId)="\"+This.List(This.ListItemId)

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Example One:

1. Create a Form with a combo box (with a style of DropDown Combo).

2. In the DblClick method of the combo box, place this code:

      This.List(This.ListItemId)='\'

3. In the RowSource for the combo box, place this code:

      customer  && This the \Samples\Data\Customer.dbf

4. In the RowSourceType for the combo box, select 8 - STRUCTURE.

5. Run the Form, and select an item on the list. When the item appears in the
   combo box, double-click to disable the item. Scroll through the list to see
   that the item is not visible.

Example Two:

1. In the DblClick method of the combo box, place this code:

      This.List(This.ListItemId)='\'+ This.List(This.ListItemId)

2. Rerun the Form. The disabled item remains visible with the
   DisabledItemForeColor and DisabledItemBackColor properties.
