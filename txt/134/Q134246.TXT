-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To hide the Application Control menu in Visual FoxPro, issue the following
command in a program or in the Command window:

      _SCREEN.CONTROLBOX=.F.

To get the Application Control menu back, issue this command:

      _SCREEN.CONTROLBOX=.T.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This works with Visual FoxPro running under Windows 3.x, Windows NT, or Windows
95.

The Application Control menu in Windows 3.x and Windows NT is the large minus
sign that appears in the top left of an application's window. It is at the end
of the title bar for the application. It has commands for:

   Restore
   Move
   Size
   Minimize
   Maximize
   Close
   Switch To

The Application Control menu in Windows 3.x and Windows NT can be accessed by
clicking the mouse or plressing ALT+Spacebar.

In Windows 95, the Application Control menu is an icon, which for Visual FoxPro
is a picture of the FoxPro fox. It has the same commands found in Windows 3.x
except for Switch To. Disabling the Application Control menu in Visual FoxPro
running under Windows 95 also disables the close box in the top right corner of
the application's windows (the "x" box).

NOTE: Be sure to allow a way to quit FoxPro or bring back the Application Control
menu.
