SUMMARY
=======

The documentation (Developer's Guide, Chapter 11, Using Controls, methods to
populate various controls, Page 294) describes the functionality of the combo
box but is not very explicit on how to populate the control. The documentation
also identifies methods for populating list boxes and drop- down list boxes. You
can use the methods used to populate the list boxes for the combo boxes as
well.

However, the documentation does not present a method to populate a combo box from
a multiple-column SQL statement cursor. This article describes how to do it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For a DropDown ComboBox to display an initial value and multiple columns from a
cursor created by an SQL SELECT statement, Microsoft recommends that you use the
following property values and methods:

Example ComboBox Properties:

      BoundColumn   = 1
      ColumnCount   = 3
      ColumnWidths  = 0,100,100
      RowSource     = SELECT city+' '+region as MyField,city,region ;
                      FROM Customer ;
                      where !empty(region) ;
                      into cursor MyCursor

      RowSourceType = 3

Example ComboBox Init Method:

      This.Value = MyCursor.MyField
