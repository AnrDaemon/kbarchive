PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool win95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Phone Dialer, you may not receive notification that the line you
are calling is busy.

CAUSE
=====

Depending on the modem and driver being used, Phone Dialer may not detect the
busy signal. This occurs because the drivers for certain modems have been
designed to not establish a data connection, when calling from Phone Dialer,
even if the number called is another modem. In order to prevent the data
connection, Phone Dialer loses the ability to detect a busy signal.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install a standard modem driver for the modem. This will cause Phone Dialer to
detect a busy signal, but may also cause Phone Dialer to establish a connection
if you call another modem.
