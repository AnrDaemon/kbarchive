OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log in to Microsoft Mail version 3.2, Delrina WinFax Pro may display
the following error message:

   Sign In Error: Incorrect Name/Password or not connected to Network

Microsoft Mail works correctly, but no MAPI-aware program can access it.
Reinstalling Microsoft Mail does not resolve the problem.

CAUSE
=====

You have installed one or more Microsoft Exchange component. Doing so replaces
the original Mapi.dll file with the Windows 95 version of the file. Reinstalling
Microsoft Mail does not replace the Mapi.dll file because the Microsoft Mail
version is an older version.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel to remove all the installed
   Microsoft Exchange components.

2. Rename the Mapi.dll file to Mapi.old in the Windows\System folder.

3. Reinstall Microsoft Mail.
