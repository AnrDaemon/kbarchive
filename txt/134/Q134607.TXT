SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot add user-level access when you try to add users or groups from a
double-byte character set (DBCS) domain. When you type the name of an existing
DBCS domain in the "Obtain list of users and groups from" box, you receive the
following error message:

   Windows could not find the specified security provider on the network. Do you
   want to use the name you typed in anyway?

If you click Yes, using the domain name you typed, and specifying that the
authenticator is a domain, everything works correctly despite the error
message.

However, if you type the name of an existing DBCS server in the box, it is
accepted without an error message.

CAUSE
=====

The problem lies with the Windows NT domain controller, which returns an empty
list when calling the enumeration function with a DBCS domain. Windows NT
handles DBCS servers correctly, and handles DBCS domains correctly, except in
the situation described above.

RESOLUTION
==========

Click Yes when you receive the error message and continue. There is no loss of
functionality or data.
