======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Windows 95 on a Compaq Concerto computer while it is docked, you
may receive the following error message when the computer restarts in the
docking station:

   101-ROM Error

After you receive the error message, the computer does not start Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

During Windows 95 setup, the Concerto BIOS makes incorrect settings to the
built-in Ethernet adapter, preventing the computer from starting Windows 95
while it is inserted in the docking station.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact Compaq for instructions about how to correct the docking station
settings. Compaq can also provide you with an updated BIOS that corrects the
problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Early versions of the Compaq Concerto BIOS allowed the built-in Ethernet
Controller EPROMs to be reprogrammed by the BIOS to incorrect values. This
problem appears to be common when setting up Windows 95 on a Compaq Concerto
with an early BIOS.

We do not know the exact BIOS version that corrects the problem, but versions
released after 7/1/95 are known to work correctly.
