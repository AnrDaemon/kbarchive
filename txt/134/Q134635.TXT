======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using System Monitor, the modem performance statistics may not be
an available option.

CAUSE
=====

In order to view modem performance statistics in System Monitor, both of the
following requirements must be met:

 - The Record A Log File option must be enabled for the modem.

 - You must be using a 32-bit communications program.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable the Record A Log File option and view modem performance statistics in
System Monitor, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Modems icon.

3. Click your modem, and then click Properties.

4. On the Connection tab, click the Advanced button.

5. Click the Record A Log File check box to select it, and then click OK. Click
   OK, and then click Close.

6. Start a 32-bit communications program (such as HyperTerminal or Dial-Up
   Networking).

7. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then
   click System Monitor.

   NOTE: System Monitor is included only on the Windows 95 CD-ROM and is not
   installed by default. If you did not install System Monitor when you
   installed Windows 95, you can install it by double-clicking the Add/Remove
   Programs icon in Control Panel, and then selecting it on the Windows Setup
   tab.

8. On the Edit menu, click Add Item.

9. In the Category list, click your modem, click Bytes Received/Sec or Bytes
   Sent/Sec in the Items list, and then click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Record A Log File option is enabled, a Modemlog.txt file is generated
in the Windows folder. This log file contains all the commands sent to and
returned by the modem and is helpful for troubleshooting modem problems.

New information is appended to the Modemlog.txt file each time you use the modem.
The Modemlog.txt file may become large over time, so you may want to delete it
periodically.
