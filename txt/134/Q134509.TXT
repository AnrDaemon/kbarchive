TITLE   :Incorrect Colors in MS-DOS-Based Graphics Programs in a Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an MS-DOS-based graphics program in a Windows 95 window, its colors
may not be displayed correctly.

CAUSE
=====

MS-DOS-based graphics programs that change their color tables are known to
exhibit this behavior in Windows 95.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, press ALT+ENTER to run the MS-DOS-based graphics
program full-screen instead of in a window. If it is necessary to place the
program in a window (for example, in order to select an image for placement on
the Windows Clipboard), minimize the window, and then restore it. This may cause
the colors to be redrawn correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are examples of programs that exhibit this behavior:

 - B-Wing by LucasArts

 - Dragon Lore by MindScape

 - Sierra Online Game Pak by Sierra

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
