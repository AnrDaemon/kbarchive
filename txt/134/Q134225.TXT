SUMMARY
=======

This article provides clarification and detailed information regarding optimal
use for the IdleProcessMaxPeriod (-TU) and IdleProcessMinPeriod (-TL) command
line options for DISPATCH.EXE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IdleProcessMaxPeriod (-TU) parameter specifies the maximum period in minutes
that the Dispatch idle process can run. The IdleProcessMinPeriod (-TL) parameter
specifies the minimum period in minutes that Dispatch can remain idle. The
following examples demonstrate how these upper and lower time limits for an idle
process are run.

A setting of -TU10, indicates that Dispatch will remain idle for up to 10
minutes. This means that if External is running as an idle process, it has up to
10 minutes to finish its current activity. After 10 minutes, Dispatch checks its
tables for any processes and completes its regular cycle, if necessary. If the
-TL option is not specified for the minimum period Dispatch is to remain idle;
an interval of 0 is assumed. If no -TL setting is used, a default value of 60
minutes will be used.

If the -TU option is set for less than 5 minutes without the -TL option, External
will run its process and will remain inactive (sleep) until Dispatch
re-initializes itself every 5 minutes.

In summary, the -TU option should only be used if it is desirable to interrupt an
idle process sooner than every 60 minutes, or if it is necessary to lengthen the
amount of time the idle process should run without interruption. The options for
-TU and -TL can not be set greater than 10,080 minutes (one week).

Refer to page 295 for version 3.2 or page 297 for version 3.5 of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks "Administrator's Guide" for the proper syntax of the - TU and
-TL options.

NOTE: To make use of this option, DISPATCH.EXE must also specify an idle process,
such as running the External program. For example:

   Command line option:

   /IdleProcess="c:\mailexe\external.exe"
