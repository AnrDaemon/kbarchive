SYMPTOMS
========

When you play a sound from a sound card in Windows 95, the sound may play
incorrectly or not at all. The problem usually occurs when you play a sound at
the same time you print something.

CAUSE
=====

Both the sound card and the printer's ECP port are configured to IRQ 7.

RESOLUTION
==========

By using Device Manager, move either the ECP port or the sound card to a new
IRQ. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel on
   the menu that appears.

2. Double-click the System Icon.

3. In the System Properties dialog box, click the Device Manager tab, and then
   select either the Sound card icon or the Ports icon.

4. In the Properties dialog box for the device you selected, click the Resources
   tab, and then make sure the Use Automatic Settings box is not checked.

5. Adjust the IRQ for the device to a new value that does not conflict with any
   other device.
