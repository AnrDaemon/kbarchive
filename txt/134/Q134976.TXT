TITLE   :PPT7: How to Restore the Default Design Template
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can change the look of your PowerPoint presentation by applying different
presentation designs (also called design templates). Sometimes you may want to
remove or clear the template, or restore a presentation so that it uses the
default PowerPoint presentation design format.

To restore the default presentation format, apply the Design Template called
Blank Presentation.pot. This template is located in the Msoffice\Templates or
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Blank Presentation.pot template has been changed or corrupted, you can
regenerate a default Blank Presentation.pot by following these steps:

1. Rename the existing Blank Presentation.pot file.

2. Start PowerPoint.

3. In the Startup dialog box, click Blank Presentation, and click OK.

4. In the New Slide dialog box, click one of the AutoLayout choices to select
   it, and click OK.

5. On the File menu, click Save.

6. Name the file Blank Presentation and click Presentation Templates in the Save
   As Type list.

7. Ensure that you are about to save to the Templates folder, and then click
   Save.

This process is similar to the way that earlier versions of PowerPoint provide
default formatting. In earlier versions, however, the file that contains the
formatting is called Default.ppt rather than Blank Presentation.pot. The .pot
extension indicates a PowerPoint template file format.
