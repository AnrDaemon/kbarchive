TITLE   :cc:Mobile Hangs After Editing Modem Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Lotus cc:Mobile, the program stops responding (hangs) after
you edit the information about your modem in the Edit Default Communications
Method dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

Lotus cc:Mobile uses Notepad to edit the modem information. Once Notepad starts,
cc:Mobile waits for it to close before continuing. Because the version of
Notepad included with Windows 95 is a 32-bit program, and 16-bit and 32-bit
programs behave differently, cc:Mobile never gets notified that Notepad has
closed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact Lotus Technical Support for information about manually editing the file
for cc:Mobile.
