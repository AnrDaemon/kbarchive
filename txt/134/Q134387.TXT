TITLE   :Cannot Boot Windows NT 3.5x From Duplexed Mirror Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a duplex mirror and the primary drive fails, you may not be able to
boot from your Fault tolerant boot floppy.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the adapter for the shadowed drive has the BIOS
disabled. Windows NT 3.5 and later use Multi instead of Scsi in the BOOT.INI
file. If the BIOS is disabled, Multi does not find the controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Enable the BIOS on the second adapter and change Scsi references to Multi in
   your BOOT.INI file.

 - Change the Multi references to Scsi in the BOOT.INI file on the floppy disk
   you are booting from. Copy your SCSI driver to the floppy disk. Rename it
   NTBOOTDD.SYS. Change the arc path read to read:

   SCSI(1).....

 - Move the previously shadowed drive to the first controller.
