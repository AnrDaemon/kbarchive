KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a Xircom CE2 PCMCIA network adapter card, the card may not work
and the computer may not be connected to the network. When this occurs, your
computer may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This network adapter may require a real-mode enabler or different MAC drivers to
work.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, load the real-mode card and socket services drivers in
the Config.sys file.

Although the actual drivers that are required vary from one system to another,
they typically look like:

   device=cs.exe
   device=sscirrus.exe

MORE INFORMATION
================

There have been cases in which the NDIS 2 drivers cause the computer to hang. In
these cases, the real-mode network drivers should be replaced with the Novell
NetWare ODI/NETX or VLM drivers.
