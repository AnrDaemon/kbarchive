SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a game that uses the PC speaker to play sounds, your computer may
run slowly or stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the game tries to set the timer chip to a rate faster
than Windows 95 can handle. When this occurs, the game does not receive timer
ticks as rapidly as it expects, causing the game to run slowly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, configure the game to run in MS-DOS mode. To do so,
follow these steps:

1. In Windows Explorer or My Computer, use the right mouse button to click the
   game's executable file, and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

2. On the Program tab, click Advanced.

3. Click the MS-DOS Mode check box to select it, and then click OK.

To run the program with the new configuration, double-click the game's executable
file. Do not type the game's executable filename at an MS-DOS prompt to start
the game.
