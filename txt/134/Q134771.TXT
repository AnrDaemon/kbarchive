SYMPTOMS
========

After running Compression Agent, you may notice that the contents of some files
on the compressed drive have changed.

CAUSE
=====

The changed files were created by a program that pre-allocates storage space by
creating one large file on the hard disk. When the program needs to write a data
file to the hard disk, it overwrites part of the original file with the data
from the new file. This method of pre-allocating storage space leads to large
areas of undefined disk space that are allocated to the original file. When
Compression Agent runs, the contents of these areas may change.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The contents that have changed are undefined areas that do not contain actual
data. This change should not affect the performance of Windows 95 or your
programs.
