PABLIST

PABLIST is an installable utility that enables users to copy the
data from their Personal Address Books into a text file. This text
file will be placed in the user's Windows directory.

Mail administrators can make this utility available to PC Mail
Windows Client users by adding the following line to the Custom
Commands section of either the user's MSMAIL.INI, or the
SHARED.INI file:

PCL1=3.0;Mail;PAB &List;14;PABLIST.DLL;;;List contents of the Personal
Address
Book

Users will need to restart Mail for this change to take effect.

PABCHECK

PABCHECK is an installable utility that enables users to check
the contents of their Personal Address Books against the current
version of the Global Address List. It will prepare a report of
duplicate addresses, addresses that have been removed from the
GAL since being placed in the PAB, and addresses that appear to
have changed since they were placed in the PAB. This report will
be placed in the user's Inbox as a mail message.

Mail administrators can make this utility available to PC Mail
Windows client users by adding the following to the Custom
Commands section of either the user's MSMAIL.INI, or the
SHARED.INI file:

PCL2=3.0;Mail;&PAB Check;15;PABCHK.DLL;;;Check contents of the
PersonalAddress Book
