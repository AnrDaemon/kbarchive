-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In version 3.2 of the Microsoft Mail Connection Gateway Release Notes, page 18,
steps 3 and 9 for performing a manual directory synchronization are missing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To perform a manual directory synchronization at the directory server
postoffice:

1. Type the following; then press ENTER:

   " reqmain -t -ddrive " (without the quotation marks)

2. Type the following; then press ENTER:

   " external -0 -ddrive -ms -mr -v -a " (without the quotation marks)

   This transfers the mail into the outbound queue for the Directory
   Synchronization (Dir-Sync) server. Use the Administrator program on each
   requestor postoffice to check the queue for the Dir-Sync server postoffice.
   There should be at least two $SYSTEM messages in the queue. One will be a
   status report; the other will have a subject line that looks like the
   following

   $SYSTEM ReqTx R=R# (was r#), S = S#, I = I# ## sent

3. Type the following; then press ENTER:

   " external -0 -ddrive -ms -mr -v -a " (without the quotation marks)

   The External Mail program actually delivers the outgoing Dir-Sync mail. If you
   are using a gateway as the MTA, type the appropriate gateway command to
   deliver the message.

4. Type the following; then press ENTER:

   " srvmain -r -ddrive " (without the quotation marks)

5. To confirm that Mail for AppleTalk Networks addresses were received, compare
   the file size and time stamp of the MSTTRANS.GLB file before and after you
   run SRVMAIN.

6. Type the following; then press ENTER:

   " srvmain -t -ddrive " (without the quotation marks)

   This puts AppleTalk Mail addresses into a $SYSTEM message file in the P1
   directory.

7. Check for a file in the P1 directory.

8. Type the following; then press ENTER:

   " External -a -0 -ddrive " (without the quotation marks)

   This command again moves the mail to the outbound queues. The server's queues
   for the requestor postoffices should show the following $SYSTEM message:

   $SYSTEM SrvTx R=R# S=S# (was s#) I = I# ## sent

9. Type the following; then press ENTER:

   " External -a -0 -ddrive " (without the quotation marks)

   This moves the P1 file into the postoffice incoming message queue. The P1 file
   should disappear from the P1 directory after you run External.

   This delivers the updates to the requestor postoffices. If a gateway is used
   as the MTA, type the appropriate command to deliver the messages.

10. Type the following; then press ENTER:

   " reqmain -r -ddrive " (without the quotation marks)

   This moves the addresses from the $SYSTEM message into the SRVTRANS.GLB file.

11. Type the following; then press ENTER:

   " import admin -ppassword -q -y -ddrive " (without the quotation marks)

   This moves addresses from the SRVTRANS.GLB file into a temporary transaction
   file and into the USR and NME files. After you run Import, the AppleTalk
   Mail addresses should appear in the Postoffice Address List (POL), but not
   in the Global Address List (GAL).

12. Type the following; then press ENTER:

   " rebuild -f -ddrive " (without the quotation marks)

   This rebuilds the GAL. After you run Rebuild, the AppleTalk Mail addresses
   should appear in the GAL.
