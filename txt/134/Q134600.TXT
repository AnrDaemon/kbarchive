TITLE   :RPL Setup Err Msg: Missing Batch File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a server-based setup of Windows 95 created using an RPL image on
a Novell NetWare diskless workstation, you may receive the following error
message:

   MISSING BATCH FILE

After you receive this message, the workstation seems to work correctly.

CAUSE
=====

Novell's NETX and VLM drivers search for an Autoexec.bat file in the Home\Suboot
directory on the server. This file is deleted by an RPL Setup, and must be
manually copied by the network administrator.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can safely ignore this error message. To prevent the error message from
occurring, use either of the following methods:

 - Have the network administrator create a new Autoexec.bat file in each user's
   Home directory.

 - Prevent Setup from deleting the Suboot directory and the Autoexec.bat file by
   adding the following line to the [Network] section of the Msbatch.inf file in
   the shared installation directory:

      savesuboot=1

   Then, MAP ROOT the A drive to the Home directory on the server, and copy the
   Autoexec.bat file from the Suboot directory to the Home directory.
