======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running a program that uses up all GDI memory in Windows 95 causes this error:

   Not enough memory to complete this operation

After the error message is closed, GDI memory is still not released. Running the
program a second time causes Visual FoxPro to quit.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Run the following program. You will get the error "Not enough memory to
   complete this operation." All GDI has been used and will not be released.

      *Attempt to create and release 2500 windows

      PRIVATE ALL EXCEPT g_*

      cOldPrint = SET('PRINT',1)
      SET PRINT OFF
      SET PRINT TO

      nMaxRows = 25
      nMaxCols = 100

      nBeforeHandles = SYS(1011)

      WAIT WINDOW 'Patience ... may look dead, check system clock' NOWAIT

      FOR i = -1 TO nMaxRows
         FOR j = -1 to nMaxCols
            cWindowName = 'Win'+ALLTRIM(STR(ABS(i)))+'_'+ALLTRIM(STR(ABS(j)))
            DEFINE WINDOW (cWindowName);
               FROM i,j TO i+10,j+10 ;
               TITLE (cWindowName)
            ACTIVATE WINDOW (cWindowName)
         ENDFOR
      ENDFOR
      FOR i = -1 TO nMaxRows
         FOR j = -1 to nMaxCols
            RELEASE WINDOW
         ENDFOR
      ENDFOR

      SET PRINT TO &cOldPrint
      SET PRINT ON

      nAfterHandles = SYS(1011)
      nDiff = VAL(nAfterHandles) - VAL(nBeforeHandles)
      ?IIF(nDiff > 50,'FAIL','PASS')

      * Clean up and exit

      WAIT CLEAR

      RELEASE ALL EXCEPT g_*
      RETURN

2. Run the program again and Visual FoxPro will quit. Then GDI is released.
