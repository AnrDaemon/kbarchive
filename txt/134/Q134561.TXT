======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using an NDIS2 MAC driver for a Novell/Eagle NE200T PCMCIA network
adapter card in Windows 95, your computer may stop responding (hang) or have no
network functionality.

CAUSE
=====

This network adapter may require the real-mode enabler for the PCMCIA card
services, or may require a different MAC driver to work properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

 - You may need to load the real-mode card and socket services drivers. Although
   the exact names of these drivers varies from one system to another, they
   typically appear as follows in the Config.sys file:

   device=c:\<path>\cs.exe device=c:\<path>\sscirrus.exe
   device=c:\<path>\csalloc.exe

   NOTE: You may be able to find references to the original real-mode drivers in
   the Config.dos file.

 - These systems also typically require that the Novell ODI/NETX or VLM driver
   be installed for the network adapter. To change the driver type, follow these
   steps:

   1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

   2. Double-click the Network icon.

   3. Click the Novell/Eagle NE200T PCMCIA network adapter, and then click
      Properties.

   4. On the Driver Type tab, click the Real Mode (16-bit) ODI Driver option
      button, and then click OK.

   5. Click OK. When you are prompted to do so, enter the location for the
      Novell files.

      NOTE: The necessary files should be on a drivers disk included with the
      network adapter, or you can obtain them from Novell.

   6. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.
