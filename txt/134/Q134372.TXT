PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.0,3.2; WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, versions 3.0, 3.2 
 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

PROFS and OfficeVision do not include Reply All functionality when you respond
to messages. Due to this limitation in the PROFS and OfficeVision product, the
Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision does not support this
feature.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you address messages in Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, you can add
multiple recipients to the To: and Cc: lines. This allows you to send one
message to more than one person. When the recipient of the message receives the
mail, they have the option to reply to the sender via the Reply command in
Microsoft Mail. Additionally, the recipient can reply to both the sender and all
other recipients by using the Reply All feature.

The Reply All functionality works with mail messages exchanged between Microsoft
Mail users and most gateways to foreign mail systems. The Reply All feature is
not available to PROFS and OfficeVision users because PROFS and OfficeVision
addressing information is maintained in the message header only for a single
recipient. Other users entered on the To: line and Cc: line are not maintained
in the message header. They appear only in the textual body of the message.


NOTE: This is no different than PROFS and OfficeVision functionality. PROFS and
OfficeVision create an individual message for each recipient addressing each
message to a single recipient. Only the single recipient is included in the
message header with additional recipients placed in the textual body of the mail
message.
