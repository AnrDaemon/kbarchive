TITLE   :SMS: Query Results Display Only First Data Record
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbDatabase smsdatabase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you query on a PC Architecture Group with multiple data records for its
attributes, the SMS Query results display only the first data record. This may
not necessarily be the value that the query was based on. However, the computer
that the information was returned for is the correct computer.

The Disk, Packages, Services, and Audited Software groups could have multiple
data records.


CAUSE
=====

This is a limitation of the SMS Administrator utility.

WORKAROUND
==========

To see the detailed information in the data record that matches the query,
double click on a client in the list to reveal the Personal Computer properties
for that system.

In order to view multiple data records for more than one client at a time, use a
different SQL query tool that is capable of generating reports. Systems
Management Server is accompanied by a copy of Crystal Reports for this purpose.
It installs with a number of predefined queries and reports to view your SMS
data. Other tools such as Microsoft Access or Microsoft Query are also capable
of generating similar reports. Before you use those applications to query the
Systems Management Server database, run SMSVIEW to create the necessary SQL
views.

For more information on using SMSVIEW, query on SMSVIEW in the Microsoft
Knowledgebase and see Appendix I of the Systems Management Server
"Administrator's Guide."

STATUS
======

This is by product design.
