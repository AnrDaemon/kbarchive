======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

CD Mania's Talking Solitaire and Talking Minesweeper programs do not work
correctly in Windows 95, and none of their talking features function.

CAUSE
=====

Talking Solitaire and Talking Minesweeper modify the standard Windows games to
add speech to various events, such as winning the game. To make these
modifications, they look for specific data inside the standard Windows games.
Because Windows 95 has added new features to Solitaire and Minesweeper, they
fail to make the modifications.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact the program manufacturer to inquire about obtaining an updated version
of the programs.

Or, run the Windows 3.1 versions of Solitaire and Minesweeper in Windows 95. CD
Mania can add its talking features to the Windows 3.1 versions of these
programs.
