OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open My Computer, you may not see network drives that are mapped in
your Novell NetWare login script.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the network drives have drive letters higher than the
drive letter specified in the "lastdrive=" statement in the Config.sys file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the "lastdrive=" statement from the Config.sys file, or change the line
to read "lastdrive=Z."

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior affects both the protected-mode Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks and the Novell NetWare real-mode VLM client.

NOTE: The real-mode VLM client requires the "lastdrive=" statement in the
Config.sys file.
