TITLE   :Unable to Open or Copy Files from a NetWare Server on FDDI Ring
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5 SP2,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 SP2, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 SP2, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On your computer running Windows NT, you can view files on a Novell NetWare
server from File Manager, but you cannot open these files or copy them to a
local drive.

The Event Viewer shows the following error:

   Event Id 8007: The Microsoft client service for Netware redirector has timed
   out a request to <NetWare_server_name>.

These symptoms occur when you use Windows NT on an Ethernet network segment with
Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) or Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW)
installed, and attach to a Novell NetWare server connected to an FDDI ring.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Decrease the packet size from 4202 to 1514 on the NetWare server.

   NOTE: This solution negatively impacts the performance of the NetWare server
   on the FDDI ring.


   -or-

 - Set DefaultMaxPacketSize to 1012. To do this:

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

   1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

   2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

      \SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\SERVICES\NWRDR\PARAMETERS

   3. Add the following value:

      DefaultMaxPacketSize:REG_DWORD: 1012 (decimal)
