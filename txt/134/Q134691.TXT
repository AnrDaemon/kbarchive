TITLE   :AFTP -F Script Fails if Password is Eight Characters Long
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the AFTP -F <INPUTFILE> command, the following error message
appears:

   The password is too long. The password must be between 1 and 8 characters in
   length.

This symptom occurs when you use the AFTP client script processing feature to
automate AFTP client processes and your password in the inputfile is eight
characters long.

CAUSE
=====

The AFTP client code erroneously counts the Newline character at the end of your
eight-character password as the ninth character when it reads the password from
your inputfile.

NOTE: For additional information on AFTP and AFTP client script processing, refer
to the SNA Server 2.11 Enhancements Guide and the SNA Server 2.11 README.TXT
file, respectively.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use a password with seven characters or fewer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
