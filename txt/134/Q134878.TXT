PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVCkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 2.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 2.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When accessing Books Online from the Help menu you receive this error:

   An errror occurred reading the index file.

Note: This article does not apply to Visual C++ 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

There is an error in the VC20BKS.HDX file.

RESOLUTION
==========

This error can be safely ignored. The error does not occur if you access Books
Online from the Visual C++ version 2.0 program group or by pressing the F1 key.

You can work around the problem by adding a tool to your Visual Workbench Tools
menu. To add a tool follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Customize.

2. Click the Tools tab.

3. Click the Add button.

4. In the Add Tool dialog box, browse for Contents.exe in the Visual C++ Bin
   directory, and click OK.

5. In the Menu Text field of Tools dialog box, enter:

   " Books Online " (without the quotation marks)

6. In the Arguments field, enter the following, and be sure to include the
   quotation marks for these entries:

   " "Visual C++ 2.0" "Books Online" " (without the quotation marks)

7. Click Close to save the settings. A mew menu entry, "Books Online," is now
   created in the Visual Workbench Tools menu, which can be used instead of
   accessing it from the Help menu.

STATUS
======
