SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print large (Type I) TrueType fonts to a MicroTek TrueLaser
printer from PageMaker version 5.0 or 5.0a, the fonts are not printed. The
printer displays a "Processing" message and then goes back online without
printing anything.

CAUSE
=====

The PostScript interpreter in the MicroTek TrueLaser printer does not conform to
standard PostScript as defined by Adobe.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the PostScript driver to download fonts to the printer as native TrueType
fonts. To do so, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Printers folder.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the MicroTek TrueLaser printer icon, and
   then click Properties on the menu that appears.

3. On the Fonts tab, click the Send Fonts As button.

4. In the Send TrueType Fonts As box, click In Native Format.

5. Click OK.
