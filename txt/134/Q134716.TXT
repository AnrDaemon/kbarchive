PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbSCMan smssetup smssiteconfigman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


Systems Management Server Hierarchy Manager does not upgrade any Secondary Sites
until all the Secondary Sites, under the same parent, have an Active status.

The upgrade jobs remain in a pending state. When the non-active secondary sites
are deleted or returned to active, the upgrade proceeds.

RESOLUTION
==========

The administrator must resolve any problems with Secondary Sites or allow
pending installations, de-installations, and component additions to finish
before attempting the upgrades.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
