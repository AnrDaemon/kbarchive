   Event 2000:
   Source: SRV
   Type: ERROR Description
   : The server's call to a system service failed unexpectedly.

   0000: 00040000 00540001 00000000 c00007d0
   0010: 00000000 c000000d 00000000 00000000

CAUSE
=====


This problem occurs when:

 - A printer is physically connected to your computer running Windows 95 and
   shared on the network.

 - You print from an MS-DOS-based application under Windows 95 to LPT2, and LPT2
   is redirected to a printer shared by Windows NT.

 - The printer shared by Windows NT is not local printer, but is redirected to a
   printer shared by Windows 95.

 - The Windows NT printer is created in two steps. You use Connect To Printer to
   access the printer shared by Windows 95 and you use Create Printer and Print
   To <destination> to print to the printer shared by Windows 95.

In above configuration, the error occurs when the spooler accesses LAN Manager
Print Services.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, edit the Registry:

WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of the Registry Editor
can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Print Manager and remove the printer previously established.

2. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

3. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers
   \LanManPrintServices\PortNames

4. Delete following key:

   REG_SZ: \\printserver\printershare

5. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.

6. Run Print Manager and create a printer:

   a. From the Printer menu, choose Create Printer.

   b. In the Print To list box, choose Others.

   c. Select Local Port and then choose OK.

   d. Type in the universal naming conversion (UNC) path to the print server,
      for example \\printsrv\printshare, and then choose OK.
