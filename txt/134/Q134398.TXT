When you are using The Microsoft Network Explorer, you can use the
following keys on the numeric keypad to expand and collapse branches:

 - The asterisk (*) expands everything under the currently selected branch in
   the left pane.

 - The plus sign (+) or RIGHT ARROW key expands one level of the branch.

 - The minus sign (-) or LEFT ARROW key collapses one level of the branch.

NOTE: To use the LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW keys on the numeric keypad,
make sure the NUM LOCK key is turned off.

IMPORTANT: If you click a large branch, such as Categories, and then press
the asterisk (*) key, it may take hours to expand that branch.
