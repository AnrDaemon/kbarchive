TITLE   :FIX: Cannot Open Database and No Message Is Displayed
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to open a Visual FoxPro database (.DBC) by using the menu
options or by clicking the Open button on the Standard toolbar, Visual FoxPro
does not open the database or issue a message if the database has been open
exclusively by another user or in a different private data session.

CAUSE
=====

The database is already open exclusively on a second machine or in another
Visual FoxPro session on the same machine. When the database is already open,
Visual FoxPro echoes the OPEN DATABASE command to the Command window, but does
not execute it.

WORKAROUND
==========

Here are three possible workarounds:

 - Attempt to open the database by executing the OPEN DATABASE command that was
   echoed to the Command window. The error "File Access Denied" occurs because
   the database is already opened exclusively.

-or-

 - Execute the OPEN DATABASE command in a program.

-or-

 - Open the database SHARED on all machines and in each Visual FoxPro session.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

In a network environment:

1. Open a database exclusively.

2. From a second machine running Visual FoxPro, attempt to Open the same
   database exclusively. On the File menu, click Open, or click the Open button
   on the Standard Visual FoxPro toolbar.

From one machine using two Visual FoxPro sessions:

1. Open a database exclusively.

2. Run Visual FoxPro a second time, keeping the first session of Visual FoxPro
   running. Attempt to open the same database exclusively. On the File menu,
   click Open, or by click the Open button on the Standard Visual FoxPro
   toolbar.
