PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500bug kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an existing ON ERROR routine is in effect, the following command causes an
error, but that error is not trapped by the error routine.

   ALTER TABLE <tablename> ADD PRIMARY KEY <existing key tag>

Instead running the error handler, Visual FoxPro presents a message box titled
"Microsoft Visual FoxPro" that contains the message "Primary key already
exists," and it offers the options of OK and Help.

The Help text topic states:

   Primary key already exists. (1883)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in Visual FoxPro
5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Write a simple program, such as the following program, to illustrate this
   error and the error as it should be handled.

      ON ERROR WAIT WINDOW "Error"
      switch=.F.
      OPEN DATABASE C:\VFP\Samples\Data\testdata.dbc
      SELECT Customer
      DO WHILE .T.
        IF !switch
          ALTER TABLE Customer ADD PRIMARY KEY cust_id
        ELSE
          ALTER TABLE Customer ADD cust_id PRIMARY KEY
        ENDIF
        switch=!switch
      ENDDO

2. Name this program Altertst and save it.

3. In the Command window, enter the DO Altertst command.

4. Press ENTER at each pause

5. After successfully observing the two error modes, press ESC to cancel.

6. In the Visual FoxPro default directory, you will find an error log created in
   response to the ON ERROR handler named Altertst.err. This is a text file and
   may be read. It will have the offending line number and the report that the
   line has a syntax error.

7. Rerun the program. When the Microsoft Visual FoxPro message box appears,
   click the Help button to see the help text.
