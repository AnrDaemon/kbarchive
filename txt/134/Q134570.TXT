SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Proteon P1346 TokenRing network adapter, you may encounter
errors with the network adapter or experience network problems.

CAUSE
=====

Some models of the Proteon P1346 network adapter do not function correctly with
Windows 95. These network adapters were shipped without EPROMs.

RESOLUTION
==========

You may be able to resolve this issue by setting a jumper labeled PHROM on the
network adapter. With this jumper enabled, the network adapter looks for
initialization information in a file called Prorapm.dwn. This file must be
located in the folder from which you start the network software.

Note that this procedure may or may not work. If this procedure does not work,
obtain an updated network adapter from the manufacturer, or contact the
manufacturer to inquire about obtaining the necessary EPROM to update the
network adapter.
