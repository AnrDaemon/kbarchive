TITLE   :Some TSRs Moved from Autoexec.bat to Winstart.bat During Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Windows 95 on a computer running Btrieve, DaVinci Mail, or
Microcom Carbon Copy, several terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs) no
longer appear in the Autoexec.bat file.

Your programs still function properly and the TSRs load into memory.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 removes the TSRs for these programs from the Autoexec.bat file and
places them in the Winstart.bat file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 moves the following TSRs to the Winstart.bat file:

Btrieve:

   Brequest.exe

DaVinci Mail:

   Mhsblink
   Mhsalarm.exe
   Wks_nb.exe

Microcom Carbon Copy:

   Doshost.exe
   Dosker

The Winstart.bat file is used to load TSRs that are required for Windows- based
programs and are not needed in MS-DOS sessions. You should not use the
Winstart.bat file for setting environment variables.
