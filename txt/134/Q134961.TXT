TITLE   :Network Monitor Hangs Windows for Workgroups 3.11
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smsnetmon kbNetworkMon

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you start a capture in Network Monitor on computer running Windows for
Workgroups that has a Compaq Netflex2 Token Ring card installed, the system
stops responding (hangs) if Microsoft TCP/IP-32 is one of your installed
protocols. If NetBEUI or NWBlink are installed without Microsoft TCP/IP-32,
starting a capture may work once, but if you stop and start the capture a second
time, an error message appears stating that the network driver does not support
promiscuous mode.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use another Token Ring card supported by Network Monitor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as is becomes available.
