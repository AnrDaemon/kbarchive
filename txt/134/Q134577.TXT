SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows 95 taskbar is not updated correctly on Toshiba laptop computers
running Maxtime. For example, minimized programs may not appear on the taskbar.

CAUSE
=====

Toshiba's Maxtime program, which is installed by default on some Toshiba laptop
computers, prevents the taskbar from being updated.

RESOLUTION

Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the Win.ini file. Remove
Maxtime.exe from the "run=" line, and then save and close the Win.ini file. When
you restart Windows 95, the taskbar will be updated correctly.
