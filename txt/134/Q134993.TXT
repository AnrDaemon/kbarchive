PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are stretching or skewing an image in Paint, you cannot enter a
negative value in the Stretch And Skew dialog box. If you attempt to enter a
negative value for a horizontal or vertical stretch, you receive the following
message:

   Please enter an integer between 1 and 500.

If you attempt to enter a negative value for a horizontal or vertical skew, you
receive the following message:

   Please enter an integer between 0 and 89.

If you use the right mouse button to click Horizontal or Vertical, and then click
What's This?, the text that appears indicates that negative numbers are valid.

CAUSE
=====

Paint does not accept negative values in the Stretch And Skew dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You would normally enter a negative skew value to skew the image to the left or
toward the bottom of the image; however, Paint does not support entering a
negative value.

You would not normally enter a negative stretch value, even though the Help topic
indicates that you can. To reduce the size of an image, enter a value from 1 to
99. To enlarge an image, enter a value from 101 to 500.
