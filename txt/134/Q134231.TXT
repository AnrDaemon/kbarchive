TITLE   :SNA Server Setup Resets CA400 Settings in WNAP
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run SNA Client Win3x Setup after installing Client Access, you may lose
Client Access Connectivity.

CAUSE
=====

After you set up the SNA Client for CA400 support, the following lines are in
the [wnap] section of your WIN.INI:

   CA400=YES
   CA400SharedFolders=YES

When you re-run the SNA Client Setup to change a client value such as network
protocol, Setup sets these entries back to their default value of "NO." This
causes CA400 support to fail.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, open your WIN.INI file with a text editor, such as
Notepad, and manually edit these entries back to "YES".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
