OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you press CTRL+ALT+DELETE and quit the Doom 2 program by clicking the End
Task button in the Close Program dialog box, when you restart Doom 2, the sound
effects are no longer present although the music may still play.

CAUSE
=====

Ending the task rather than shutting down Doom 2 causes the program to change
the Sound Blaster IRQ setting in the Doom 2 configuration file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use CTRL+ALT+DELETE to quit the Doom 2 program. If you do have to use
CTRL+ALT+DELETE because of a problem, shut down Windows 95 and restart it so
that the Sound Blaster IRQ setting are restored.
