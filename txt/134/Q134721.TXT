TITLE   :HOWTO: How to Handle Visual FoxPro Connectivity Errors w/o DBERR
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The DBERROR() function from previous versions no longer exists nor does an
equivalent SQLERROR() function that you might expect to find. There are still
ways to find out the same information though. The function AERROR() is used
throughout the product for retrieving error information and the SQLSETPROP()
function also gives us some control over the SQL error messages specifically.

MORE INFORMATION
================

First Method
------------

Using Aerror() will create an array containing the error code and error message.
It could be implemented as follows for catching the full ODBC error that occurs
when connecting to a datasource :

   ****************************
   *  Example of using AERROR()
   *
   dsource='test'
   Handle=SQLCONNECT(dsource,"","")
   IF HANDLE<0
        retval=AERROR(atmp)
        errval=atmp(1,1)
        errmsg=atmp(1,2)
        WAIT WINDOW STR(ERRVAL)+": "+ERRMSG
   ENDIF

Second Method
-------------

Setting up similar error trapping would be to use the SQLSetProp() function to
set the DispWarning property to True. This will actually be easier than the old
DBError() function because once this is set the full ODBC error text will
automatically be displayed without having to test the return value or having to
fill variables and display them yourself. A connection handle of 0 sets this as
a default for all subsequent connections.

   ****************************
   *  Example using SQLSETPROP()
   *
   retval=SQLSETPROP(0,"DispWarnings",.T.)
   * The "0" parameter above creates a "dummy" channel to turn Dispwarnings on
   dsource='test'
   Handle=SQLCONNECT(dsource,"","") && Error returning line
