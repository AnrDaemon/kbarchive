======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


You are unsuccessful in redistributing a package from a child site that was
created at the parent site even though you are following the instructions on
page 310 of the "System Management Server Administrator's Guide."

When you are trying to redistribute a package from a child site that was created
at the parent site:

 - The package does not appear in the list of available packages.

-or-

 - When you drag and drop the package onto the site the following error message
   appears:

   Package type is incorrect.

   To create a job with a domain or machine target, you must use a package that
   has been setup for Workstation

CAUSE
=====

The documentation is lacking information in the section for package
redistribution.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you need to create a job for the package with only the
send phase completed and send the jobs to the appropriate sites. This updates
the package with setup information and allows the package to be used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
