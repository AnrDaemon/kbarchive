TITLE   :Access Violation in glsbCreateAndDuplicateSection API on PowerPC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOM
-------

When you install a OpenGL client video driver on your PowerPC computer
running Windows NT and you run an OPENGL program, for example, the Windows
NT Pipes screen saver, an access violation occurs in the
glsbCreateAndDuplicateSection application programming interface (API).

CAUSE
=====

The assembly dispatch stubs for the GL API do not properly save and restore the
TOC register when they make their call.

If these stubs are only called from a different module then this code works
properly because the other module has code to save and restore the TOC. However,
Windows NT makes several GL calls in OPENGL32 itself, such as glFlush and a
variety of calls in the wgl font routines, and these calls do not save and
restore the TOC because everything is in the same DLL.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
