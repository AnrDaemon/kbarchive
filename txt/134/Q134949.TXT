======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the SMTPGATE.EXE, the following error message will occur if the
FILES= setting in the CONFIG.SYS is set too low:

   ERROR SMTPPUT: 201- X - X - Failure submitting message to mail database
   [tx] 552 Error in local delivery

CAUSE
=====

Because this program requires the use of a large number of file handles, and if
the FILES= statement in the CONFIG.SYS is set too low, the program will be
unable to execute properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the CONFIG.SYS, and increase the FILES= statement. Initially set the FILES
to 40, and increase them as needed.
