SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a network adapter with a DEC 24x4x chip set, the network
adapter seems to install correctly, but it does not communicate with the
network. If you use the NET USE command at an MS-DOS prompt, you receive the
following error message:

   Error 51: The computername specified is not receiving requests.

CAUSE
=====

The Transceiver Type setting for the network adapter is automatically set to
Autodetect with this chip set.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the Transceiver Type setting to the appropriate setting for the network
adapter. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, and then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

2. Click the network adapter, and then click Properties.

3. On the Advanced tab, change the Transceiver Type setting to the correct
   value.

4. Click OK.

STATUS
======

This situation is most likely caused by design changes in Windows 95. Microsoft
has confirmed that it is not caused by a problem in Windows 95. For more
information about resolving this issue, contact DEC.
