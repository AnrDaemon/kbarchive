PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:dun win95 kbDialUp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a Dial-Up Networking server that requires you to enter logon
information in a Terminal window, the Terminal window may display random
characters instead of the logon information.

CAUSE
=====

The Terminal window supports only ASCII text. If the server you are connecting
to uses terminal emulation and does not send ASCII text, you see random
characters. Terminal emulation is not supported by the Terminal window in
Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact the server's administrator to determine whether it can be changed to
send only ASCII text.
