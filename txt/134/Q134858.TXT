The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, versions 3.11, 3.11a, 3.11b 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To remove the NetBIOS support layer that is above TCP/IP-32 for Windows for
Workgroups 3.11, remove the file name VNBT.386 from the transport line in
the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:

   transport=....,vnbt.386

NetBIOS applications and NetBIOS browsing and name resolution do not work
after this change, however, the Sockets application interface is still
available for applications like FTP and Telnet.

Additional query words: wfw wfwg 3.11 3.11a 3.11b
