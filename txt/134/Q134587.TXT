SYMPTOMS

When you try to run an MS-DOS-based program, you may receive the following error
message:

This error is more likely to occur with computer-aided design (CAD) programs such

these steps:

1. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the System.ini file in the
   Windows directory.

2. Add the following line to the [386Enh] section of the file

   device=<path>:\pharlap.386

   where <path> is the full path to the Pharlap.386 file.
