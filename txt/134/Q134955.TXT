The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

SYMPTOMS
========


During the installation of Network Monitor from the Systems Management Server CD,
an icon is created for Systems Management Server Setup. The icon does not run
anything.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server Setup icon references the following command line:

   <drive>:\SMSadmin\SITE.SRV\X86.BIN\SETUP.EXE

where <drive> indicates the drive letter of the drive Network Monitor is
installed on. SETUP.EXE is not copied into this directory during setup.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
