PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbprint kbPrintingkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are printing a PowerPoint for Windows 95 presentation to a printer whose
port is set to FILE and you cancel the print job, PowerPoint hangs (stops
responding), even after you try to cancel the File dialog box that asks you for
a filename.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if background printing is turned on and you have not
selected the Print To File check box in the Print dialog box.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can prevent this problem by turning off background printing:

1. In PowerPoint, click Options on the Tools menu.

2. Click the General tab. Clear the Print In Background check box.

If you don't want to disable background printing, be sure to select the Print To
File check box in the Print dialog box, even if the printer driver is already
set up to print to a port called FILE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PowerPoint version 7.0 for
Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
