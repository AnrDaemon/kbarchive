TITLE   :Unable to Set Up New PCMCIA Card on Single-Socket System
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer with only one PCMCIA socket, Windows 95 cannot set up a new PCMCIA
card if the original PCMCIA card is being used to access the Windows 95 source
files.

CAUSE
=====

If you remove the PCMCIA card that is providing access to the Windows 95 source
files to set up a new card, Windows 95 cannot access the source files. When you
are prompted to provide the source files, you cannot remove the new card and
insert the original card because Windows 95 does not detect the removal and
insertion of PCMCIA cards during the configuration of the new card.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Add New Hardware Wizard to manually install the new PCMCIA card. This
process preinstalls the necessary driver files, so that you can set up the new
card without accessing the Windows 95 source files.
