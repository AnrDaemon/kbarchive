TITLE   :Incorrect DOS Version Error When Using MS-DOS 6.22 PDF
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade a Windows for Workgroups client running on MS-DOS versions 5.0
through 6.21 to MS-DOS 6.22 using the supplied package definition file
DOS622.PDF, the following error appears:

   Incorrect DOS version

The error occurs after UPGRD622 or STPUP622 has copied the package source files
locally and shuts down Windows for Workgroups in order to start MS-DOS Setup.

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs when OUTSMART.EXE tries to spawn COMMAND.COM and finds the
uncompressed new COMMAND.COM from the MS-DOS 6.22 installation files instead of
the COMMAND.COM for the version of MS-DOS that is currently installed.

NOTE: OUTSMART.EXE is the MS-DOS-based utility used to start the MS-DOS Setup
program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The cause of the problem depends on which package command line is used for the
'run command on workstation' job.

1. If you are using the following command lines, the problem occurs because you
   are using the MS-DOS 6.22 Upgrade disks as the package source instead of the
   MS-DOS 6.22 Step-Up disk.

   Batch Step-Up Win/WFW Client
   Manual Step-Up Win/WFW Client


2. If you are using the following command lines, the problem is occurs because
   OUTSMART.EXE not switching away from the current directory and therefore
   finding the wrong copy of COMMAND.COM:

   Batch Upgrade Win/WFW Client
   Manual Upgrade Win/WFW Client


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create the source directory for the package from
the MS-DOS 6.22 Step-Up disks, or create the source directory for the package
with the actual MS-DOS 6.22 installation files one subdirectory deep. For
example, setup a directory called MSDOS.SRC with a subdirectory called 622. Put
the MS-DOS installation files in the MSDOS.SRC\622 directory. Create the package
with the MSDOS.SRC directory as the source. This prevents OUTSMART from finding
the wrong version of COMMAND.COM because it is no longer in the current
directory.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
