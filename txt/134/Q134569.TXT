TITLE   :Orchid Vidiola Premium Card Detected as Vidiola Standard
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 detects and configures the Orchid Vidiola video capture card as a
Vidiola Standard card.

CAUSE
=====

The Orchid Vidiola card is built around the AuraVision VxP500 chipset, and
Windows 95 detects it by the chipset as well as by the existence of the
Avwin.ini file that contains the initialization information for the card.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, install the original Orchid drivers for the
Vidiola Premium card to use the MJPEG option. However, doing so may have the
side effect of the system faulting in the User.exe file because of a problem in
the Vinit.exe snooper application for this card. If the Orchid Vidiola video
capture card is still detected as a Vidiola Standard card, contact Orchid for a
resolution to this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Premium model is equivalent to a Standard model, but has more on-board
memory and an MJPEG daughter card. The detection module finds nothing
distinctive between them, and as a result detects the Premium model as a
Standard model.
