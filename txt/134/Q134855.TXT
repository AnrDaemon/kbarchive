TITLE   :PRB: Unable to Edit Blank Text Boxes in a Grid
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a grid, when you try to edit a column that doesn't have a control source, the
computer beeps and the text is not entered. You might expect that the grid would
accept data.

CAUSE
=====

This is the correct behavior for columns that don't have a ControlSource set. If
you set the ControlSource, the column is editable. As the code below
demonstrates, a table defined with only two fields as a control source for the
grid disallows the additional column a place to store the new information being
entered when the button's click procedure is run.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create a custom grid class with an Init procedure to alter the table or
ControlSource to allow the user to create and store new data by passing the
optional "init1,init2" parameter used with the addobject() function.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Run the following code:

   CREATE TABLE table1 ;
        (col1 C(15), col2 c(15))
   append blank
   replace col1 with 'Row(1)  Col(1)'
   replace col2 with 'Row(1)  Col(2)'
   append blank
   replace col1 with 'Row(2)  Col(1)'
   replace col2 with 'Row(2)  Col(2)'
   append blank
   replace col1 with 'Row(3)  Col(1)'
   replace col2 with 'Row(3)  Col(2)'
   append blank
   replace col1 with 'Row(4)  Col(1)'
   replace col2 with 'Row(4)  Col(2)'
   append blank
   replace col1 with 'Row(5)  Col(1)'
   replace col2 with 'Row(5)  Col(2)'
   skip - 5

   use table1

   public x
   x = create("f1")
   x.show

   define class f1 as form
   add object grid1 as grid with ;
   forecolor = rgb(255,0,0);

   add object b1 as commandbutton with ;
   fontsize = 8, ;
   caption = 'AddColumn', ;
   top = 200

   add object l1 as label with ;
   caption = 'Clicking this button should add a Column.', ;
   fontsize = 8, ;
   autosize = .T., ;
   top  = 220
   proc b1.click
        x.grid1.addcolumn
        x.grid1.column3.addobject('text','textbox')
        x.grid1.column3.currentcontrol = 'text1'
        x.grid1.column3.text1.visible = .t.
        x.refresh
   endproc
   enddefine

   * Click the AddColumn button.
   * Click in one of the blank cells and begin typing.
