TITLE   :BUG: DragIcon Can Be Dragged Outside Visual FoxPro Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The custom mouse pointer being dragged in a FoxPro window retains its icon
outside the window. The icon should be reset to the default Windows pointer
outside the FoxPro Window.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the DragIcon property is set for an object and dragging
is then enabled by using the Drag method or the DragMode property. Visual FoxPro
does not reset the mouse pointer when it passes outside Visual FoxPro
boundaries.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

The problem can be duplicated in Visual FoxPro 3.0 and 3.0b by running
Controls.app from the Visual FoxPro \Samples\Controls directory:

1. Type the following commands in the Command window:

      SET DEFAULT TO HOME() + "SAMPLES\CONTROLS"
      DO controls.app

2. Select the Understanding Visual FoxPro option.

3. Select the See Event Firing Sequences option, and choose Run Example.

4. Drag the Foxhead graphic. You will see that if the Visual FoxPro window is
   not maximized, you can drag the icon off the Visual FoxPro window, and it
   retains its shape as a Foxhead instead of turning into the standard Windows
   arrow pointer.
