SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Cirrus Logic SVGA 5402 video adapter and you drag a window
to a new location on the screen with the mouse, the screen may not be redrawn
correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 Cirrus Logic video drivers are not fully compatible with the
older Cirrus Logic SVGA 5402 adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use any one of the following methods:

 - Set the Hardware Acceleration slider to None. To do so, use the right mouse
   button to click My Computer, click Properties on the menu that appears, click
   the Performance tab, click Graphics, move the Hardware Acceleration slider
   all the way to the left, and then click OK.

 - Change the video adapter type to Standard Display Adapter (VGA) or Super VGA.

 - Upgrade to a newer video adapter.

STATUS
======

This situation is most likely caused by design changes in Windows 95. Microsoft
has confirmed that it is not caused by a problem in Windows 95. For further
information, please contact the video adapter manufacturer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing a Windows 3.1 generic SVGA driver does not resolve the problem
described in this article. Try the methods listed in this article to resolve
