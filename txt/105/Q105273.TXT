TITLE   :System Hangs When Booting with IBM Token Ring RPL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

If your system boots using a first generation RPL chip in an IBM Token Ring
card, the system may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs due to a timing problem between the RPL chip and the MS-DOS
6 code used to pause the system during startup.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, upgrade to a later generation RPL chip or add the
following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:

   SWITCHES=/F

If you are using MS-DOS 6.2 and DoubleSpace, you need to add the SWITCHES=/F
command to your DBLSPACE.INI file as well. To do so, type "dblspace /switches=f"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press
ENTER.

NOTE: You need to contact the system administrator to have the CONFIG.SYS file
updated in the RPL chip.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An RPL chip is inserted in an IBM Token Ring card and provides remote boot
ability.
