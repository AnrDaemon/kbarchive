-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The MS-DOS 6.2 DISKCOPY command uses your hard disk as an interim storage area,
which makes copying from one floppy disk to another faster and easier.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DISKCOPY stores its temporary data in the location specified by the SET TEMP=
environment variable. It does not use expanded memory services (EMS) or extended
memory specification (XMS) memory.

If there is no SET TEMP environment variable DISKCOPY writes the temporary data
to the root directory of the hard disk drive. If the TEMP environment variable
is set to a nonexistent directory, there is insufficient space on the hard disk
drive, or your set TEMP environment variable points to a RAM drive with
insufficient space, DISKCOPY reverts to its previous multiple- pass behavior
after displaying the following message:

   Error creating image file.
   Diskcopy will revert to a multiple-pass copy.

Making Faster Single-Pass Copies with a RAM Drive
-------------------------------------------------

You can increase the single-pass copy speed by setting your TEMP environment
variable to a RAM drive. For example, if your RAM drive is drive D, use SET
TEMP=D:\.

NOTE: Make the RAM drive slightly larger than the largest media you will be
copying. For example, to copy a 1.44-megabyte disk with a RAM drive, create a
RAM drive of 1450 kilobytes.
