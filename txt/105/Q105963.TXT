TITLE   :PC Forms: Unable to Set Message Priority in E-Forms
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,3.0,3.2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a custom form created with version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic
Forms Designer, you cannot set the priority of a message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of a limitation of Simple Messaging Application
Program Interface (MAPI), which is included with versions 3.0 and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you send a standard Microsoft Mail message (Send Note), you can select the
Options button to set the priority of the message. Because this feature has not
been implemented in Simple MAPI, it is not accessible from a custom E-form. This
issue will be addressed in Extended MAPI.

The only message option currently supported by Simple MAPI is Return Receipt. To
add this option, set the "flags" parameter of the MAPIMessage type equal to
MAPI_RECEIPT_REQUESTED.
