SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the Device settings in the MPLAYER.INI file (the
initialization file for Media Player for Windows).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The [Devices] section of your MPLAYER.INI file can include the following
entries:

   CDAudio=17, CD Audio
   Sequencer=22, MIDI Sequencer
   WaveAudio=22, Sound
   Mixer=0, Media Vision Multimedia Mixer
   AVIVideo=22, Video for Windows
   MMMovie=22, Microsoft Multimedia Movie Player

The numbers that follow each equals sign indicate whether the device is simple or
compound, and whether or not it is present.

   17 = simple device
   22 = compound device
    0 = device not present

Simple devices do not need additional elements (such as a filename) for playback.
Compound devices require a filename (such as the name of a waveform [.WAV] file)
for playback.

NOTE: Informal testing has found that you may need to set the CD Audio line to 21
to be able to use Media Player to play CD tracks and display CD track
information.
