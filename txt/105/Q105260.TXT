The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

After removing MS-DOS DoubleSpace, you may receive the following error message:

   You cannot access any DoubleSpace drives because the DoubleSpace driver,
   DBLSPACE.BIN, is not installed.

CAUSE
=====

This error is generated if DoubleSpace fails to remove any
DEVICE=C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.SYS commands from your CONFIG.SYS file. This situation
typically occurs if you have followed the sequence below.

1. Installed MS-DOS 6.0.

2. Installed DoubleSpace.

3. Installed MS-DOS 6.2.

4. Uncompressed your DoubleSpace drives.

5. Removed MS-DOS 6.2.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this situation, edit your CONFIG.SYS file and remove all
DEVICE=C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.SYS commands.

Additional query words: 6.20 uninstalling
