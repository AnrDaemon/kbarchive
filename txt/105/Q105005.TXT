TITLE   :PRB: DDEInitiate() Gives Remote Data Not Accessible Dialog Box
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,2.5a,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In FoxPro for Windows the DDEInitiate() function may result in getting an
undesirable "? Remote data not accessible. Start application
'<appname>.EXE'?" dialog box.

Code following the DDEInitiate() function may check for the return of -1, which
indicates that the channel was not established; however, the code is not yet
executed.

CAUSE
=====

The default setting for the Safety clause of the DDESetOption() function is true
(.T.). This setting specifies whether a dialog box is displayed when the
DDEInitiate() function is used to establish a channel to a server application
and the application is not currently open.

RESOLUTION
==========

Issue the DDESetOption() function prior to the DDEInitiate() function to change
the setting for Safety to false (.F.).

For example, the following code establishes a DDE channel between Microsoft
FoxPro for Windows and Microsoft Excel, even if Microsoft Excel is not presently
minimized in the Windows background, without receiving the dialog box message
mentioned above:

      =DDESetOption("SAFETY",.F.)
      DO WHILE .T.
         =DDESetOption("TimeOut",10000)
         iChannel=DDEInitiate("Excel","System")
         =DDESetOption("TimeOut",2000)
         IF iChannel !=-1   && If Excel is started, exit loop
            EXIT
         ELSE             && Start Excel & try to get channel
            RUN /N3 d:\msoffice\excel\excel.exe   && Change this line
                                         && according to your path to Excel.
         ENDIF
      ENDDO
