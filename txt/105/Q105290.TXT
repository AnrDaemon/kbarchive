The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP displays the error message:

   Insufficient memory

CAUSE
=====

This error usually is seen when a message has more than 300 recipients and the
SMTP gateway has low memory available in the conventional 640k RAM.

System requirements place a strain on the available conventional memory. The SMTP
Gateway code requires different amounts of memory depending on which TCP/IP
stack is used, and the TCP/IP stack must also be loaded, although it can be
loaded high if memory is available. Finally, the Gateway's configuration files
and the postoffice routing files are also loaded:

   LOCAL.CFG
   ADDR_MAP.CFG
   NETWORK.GLB
   *.XTN (All files in the XTN directory)
   GROUP.GLB
   ACCESS2.GLB

If the Gateway postoffice has many mailboxes and the Gateway serves many
downstream postoffices, the amount of memory left for processing mail messages
can become unacceptably low.

This error will also be returned if there is a corrupt *.P1 file in the P1
directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Unfortunately, there are so many variables involved that it is very difficult to
provide enough memory to process messages under all conditions.

But there are two ways to provide the Gateway with more working memory to handle
large messages and user lists: you can load MS-DOS, the network operating
system, and the TCP/IP software above the 640k conventional memory, and you can
reduce the size of the ACCESS2.GLB and GROUP.GLB files by moving users off the
Gateway postoffice and deleting unused groups.

If there is a corrupt .P1 file, clearing the *.P1 files from the P1 directory
will usually resolve the problem.
