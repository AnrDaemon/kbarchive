SUMMARY
=======

When you type "DBLSPACE /DELETE <drive letter>:" (without the quotation
marks), you receive the following prompt:

   Deleting drive <drive letter> will permanently erase it and all the
   files it contains. Are you sure you want to delete drive <drive
   letter>?

Since there is no other prompt (such as "[Y/N]"), the machine appears to stop
responding (hang).

To answer yes, press Y; to answer no, press N.

NOTE: This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and
filenames.
