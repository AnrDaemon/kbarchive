KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up is interrupted while it is patching files, it may leave
zero-byte files in the root directory. Also, patch files (*.??#) may be left in
the directory containing your MS-DOS 6.0 files.

CAUSE
=====

The patch process used to update your existing MS-DOS files creates and uses
temporary files. These files are created in the root directory and are deleted
by Setup when it exits in a normal no-error condition. Whenever Setup is aborted
abnormally (such as by a power failure), the temporary files are not deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

The zero-byte files left in your root directory (and the patch files in the
directory containing your MS-DOS 6.0 files) can safely be deleted after you have
successfully installed MS-DOS 6.2. The temporary files in the root directory
typically have names including numbers such as 10 or 11.

Additional query words: 6.20
