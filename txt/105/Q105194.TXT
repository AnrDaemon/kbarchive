The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS) features a graphical user
interface Phone Book program for entering and maintaining the names
and telephone numbers of remote networks. Clients can connect to and
disconnect from these networks through the Phone Book manually. It is
possible to have RAS automatically dial a number for you when you log
on by using RASDIAL.EXE, a command line interface to RAS in Windows
NT.

Use the following procedure to automatically connect to a RAS server
for a desired User when you start Windows NT:

1. Log on to Windows NT as the user who should automatically connect.

2. Make note of an existing RAS Access entry name or create a new one called
   MYSERVER. Verify that all the necessary information is in the entry.

   NOTE: This procedure assumes that the user is already familiar with setting up
   entries in Remote Access address book.

3. In Program Manager, open the Startup group and choose New from the File menu.

4. From the New Program Object box, select Program Item and choose OK.

5. Enter the following on the command line:

   RASDIAL.EXE MYSERVER.

6. Choose OK.

The next time this user logs on to the workstation, RASDIAL will
connect to MYSERVER.

RASDIAL is one of the programs installed when installing RAS in
Windows NT. RASDIAL is a command line program which can be used at
the Command Prompt (CMD.EXE) or in a batch file. To learn more about
the available parameters for RASDIAL, type RASDIAL /? at the Command
Prompt for online help.
