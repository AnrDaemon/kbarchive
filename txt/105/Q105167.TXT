-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft LAN Manager Extraction utility (LMEXT.EXE) attempts to
extract more information than the program is capable of using, it may display
the following error:

   Error 234: Additional data is available but could not be retrieved

CAUSE
=====

The LMEXT.EXE utility will not record any information into the import file. The
error message appears when a system is accessed with approximately 600 users or
when 32K of users are retrieved.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Prevent the users from accessing the system.

2. Back up the server.

3. Delete users until the number of users is fewer than 550.

4. Run the LMEXT.EXE utility.

5. Restore the server from the backup.

6. Delete the 550 users whose definitions were created in the previous import
   file. (Repeat steps 4 through 6 if more than 1050 users are defined on the
   system).

7. Run the LMEXT.EXE utility again.

8. Restore the server from the backup.
