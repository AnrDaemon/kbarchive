The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MCI, version 2.1b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to MCI requires the TSR (terminate-and-stay-
resident) serial driver XPC.EXE, which in turn requires this setup:

 - 8 data bits

 - none or space parity

 - 1 stop bit

The communications capabilities offered by international carriers (such as Tymnet
and Infonet) are often not compatible with the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MCI.
Most international carriers use 7 data bits, even parity and 1 stop bit. The MCI
Gateway requires 8 data bits, none or space parity and 1 stop bit. Other
carriers try to use the MCI Gateway with the MNP protocol, but it is not
supported by Microsoft.
