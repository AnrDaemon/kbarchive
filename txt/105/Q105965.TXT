When you run automatic Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) using the Dispatch

It makes no difference if the postoffice is a server or a requestor.

The Mail administrator has disabled the Global Address List (GAL) automatic
rebuild function.

RESOLUTION

Rebuild the GAL manually:

   Requestor, Options and set Rebuild to YES.
