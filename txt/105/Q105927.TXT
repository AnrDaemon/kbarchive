TITLE   :MS-DOS 6.x Backup Err Msg: "...Catalog File Is Corrupt"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select and back up 1,023 or 2,047 files (not including the catalog
file), you receive the following error message from Microsoft Backup:

   Critical Error
   The catalog file is corrupt


This problem does not occur in Microsoft Backup for Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, select more or fewer than 1,023 or 2,047 files (not
including the catalog file)--the problem occurs only when you have exactly 1,023
or 2047 files selected.

NOTE: After you select the files to back up and choose OK, the status screen at
the main backup menu states how many files were selected for backup. This number
includes the catalog file. Therefore, in the situation described above, it would
state that 1,024 or 2,048 files were selected for backup.

If you select and back up 1,024 or 2,048 files (not including the catalog file),
you receive the following error message when you try and restore them:

   Critical Error
   The catalog file is corrupt
   Rebuild the catalog for this
   backup set, then retry the restore


To work around this problem, restore 1,023 or 2,047 files and then restore the
additional file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS
versions 6.0 and 6.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
