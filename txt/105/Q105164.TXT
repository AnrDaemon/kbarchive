-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you work online, Schedule+ cannot create or update the .CAL file if you
have Read-Only access. If you have Read-Only access, Schedule+ returns the
following error message:

   Your schedule file is locked

CAUSE
=====

Every Schedule+ user needs to have the following rights in the CAL subdirectory
Read, Write, Create, Erase, Modify, and FileScan. Without these rights, you are
unable to use Schedule+ online.

Without FileScan rights, the online .CAL file may not be properly updated if
changes are made in the offline mode. However, you can use Schedule+ off line
without any rights for the CAL subdirectory.
