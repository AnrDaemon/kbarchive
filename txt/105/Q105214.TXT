TITLE   :Windows NT 3.1 to HP LM/X 1.4 Long Filename Problems
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 systems cannot see any files in a directory on a
Hewlett-Packard (HP) LM/X 1.4 server if any file in the directory contains a
period (or "dot") followed by more than seven characters. If you use the "dir"
command to check the contents of the directory, you will receive the following
message:

   File Not Found.

CAUSE
=====

HP LM/X 1.4 systems negotiate to Server Message Block (SMB) Specification Ext
2.0 (LAN Manager 1.x), which doesn't support long filenames. When speaking this
down-level protocol, Windows NT 3.1 does not set bit 4 of Byte 9 of its SMBs.
This bit is defined as follows:

   flags (smb_flg) bit 4:

   "When on, all paths sent to the server by the consumer are already in
   the canonicalized format used by OS/2. This means that file/directory
   names are in upper case, are valid characters and backslashes are used
   as separators."

STATUS
======

A fixed, untested version of the RDR.SYS driver is available from Microsoft
Product Support Services.
