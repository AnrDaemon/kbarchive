TITLE   :PRB: Records from Other Platforms Remain in .SCX/.FRX
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.5b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you transport a screen or report from one FoxPro platform to another,
records for the other platform remain in the .SCX or .FRX file. In addition,
records deleted on one platform remain in the file for other platforms.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design on all platforms to ensure cross-platform code
compatibility when platform-specific features are used.

For example, if a FoxPro for MS-DOS screen that contains text push buttons is
transported to FoxPro for Macintosh, the developer may choose to use picture
push buttons on the Macintosh instead. Therefore, the developer will delete the
text push buttons that were transported from the MS-DOS platform and create
picture push buttons for the Macintosh platform. However, the MS-DOS records
remain so that the code can be properly re- created on the MS-DOS platform if
the screen is retransported from the Macintosh platform.
