SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to mount a DoubleSpace-compressed removable media disk, you receive
the following error message:

   Dblspace cannot mount drive <letter>: The <letter>:\Dblspace.000
   file is not a valid compressed volume file. To fix it, type scandisk
   <letter>:\Dblspace.000 at the command prompt.

If you run ScanDisk, it will likely report no errors.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, remove the write protection from the removable
media disk.
