-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the FoxPro for Macintosh command editor, double-clicking a
word highlights any spaces trailing the word. In most applications for the
Macintosh, double-clicking selects only the word itself.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior is by design to ensure compatibility with FoxPro for MS-DOS and
FoxPro for Windows.

Additional query words: VFoxMac FoxMac select click twice
