======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5x, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to append a Data Interchange Format (DIF) file, the following
error message is returned:

   Invalid DIF vector - DBF field mismatch.

RESOLUTION
==========

Perform one of the following:

 - If the software that generated the .DIF file supports any of the file types
   supported in FoxPro, use one of them instead. For a list of supported file
   types see the APPEND FROM command in the "Microsoft FoxPro Language
   Reference" L3-193. FoxPro can also open dBASE files directly. If this is not
   possible, you will need to use Low-Level file I/O; see Chapter 10 of the
   "Developers Guide."

-or-

 - Reverse the Vector and Tuple values.

   DIF files are essentially text files that contain various statements defining
   the data items. Among the data in a .DIF file are items labeled 'VECTORS' and
   'TUPLES'. Reverse the values for the Vectors and Tuples.

   For example, here is a sample Microsoft Excel .DIF file that FoxPro can't
   import:

   VECTORS
   0,3
   TUPLES
   0,4

   Modify the file so that it looks like the following:

   VECTORS
   0,4
   TUPLES
   0,3

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: This has been reported to occur with .DIF files created by applications
other than Microsoft Excel.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, fill cells A1 to A10 with the string 'abcd'
   or the numeric 1234. Save the file in DIF format as SHEET1.DIF.

2. Create a single-field table structure in FoxPro, and define that field as
   either character or numeric with the default width (per the data type entered
   in step 1).

3. Issue the following command at the command window:

   APPEND FROM sheet1.dif TYPE DIF
