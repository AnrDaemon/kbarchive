TITLE   :SMARTDRV Err Msg After Installing DBLSPACE: You Must Specify
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22; WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msdos win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

If you install DoubleSpace on a machine that already has SMARTDrive installed,
you receive the following error message:

   You must specify the host drive for a DoubleSpace drive.

CAUSE
=====

This situation occurs when you have write caching enabled for a specific drive,
and you then run DoubleSpace to compress it. For example, if you have "SMARTDRV
C+" in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to specify read/write caching for drive C and then
you compress drive C, you receive the error message noted above.

This situation occurs because DoubleSpace installation does not modify the
SMARTDRV command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this situation, use a text editor such as MS-DOS Editor to edit
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and change the SMARTDRV command so that it automatically
determines which drives to cache. For example:

   SMARTDRV

Additional query words: 6.20 6.22
