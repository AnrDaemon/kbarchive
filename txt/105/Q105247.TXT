SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install a printer in Windows NT, you may receive one of the
following error messages:

 - There are no print processors

 - Print Processor is unknown

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if all of the following conditions exist:

 - No print processor is specified in the Windows NT registry.

 - The print processor file (Winprint.dll) is missing or corrupt.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the Winprint.dll file exists in the following folder:

   %SystemRoot%\system32\spool\prtprocs\w32x86

   If the Winprint.dll file is missing, use the following command to expand the
   Winprint.dl_ file on your Windows NT Setup CD-ROM or Setup disks to
   Winprint.dll in the above folder:

   expand x:\i386\winprint.dl_
   c:\winnt\system32\spool\prtprocs\w32x86\winprint.dll

   where x: is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive.

2. Verify that the print processor is configured correctly in the Windows NT
   registry. To do so, follow these steps:

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

   a. Locate the following key in the Windows NT registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print
   \Environments\Windows NT x86\Print Processors\winprint

   If the Winprint key is not present, create it by clicking Add Key on the Edit
   menu. If Winprint.dll is not specified as the Driver value in the Winprint
   key, click Add Value on the Edit menu to create the Driver value using the
   following settings:

   Driver:REG_SZ:winprint.dll

   NOTE: It may be necessary to restart the computer after making these changes.
