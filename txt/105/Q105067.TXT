-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Undelete (UNDELETE.EXE) in an MS-DOS session under
Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, the MS-DOS Prompt display
changes from "windowed" to full screen.

Also, when Undelete is running, you cannot press ALT+TAB, CTRL+ESC, or ALT+ENTER
to switch tasks.

CAUSE
=====

Undelete goes into exclusive mode to prevent other applications from changing
the directory while Undelete has control. Without this precaution, it is
possible that another program could create or delete a file in the current
directory. Undelete could then be reading an invalid directory structure.
