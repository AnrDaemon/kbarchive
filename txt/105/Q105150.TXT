SUMMARY
=======

In addition to providing the ability to dynamically split a single view, the
CSplitterWnd class provides a convenient method of displaying two or more view
classes in a single frame. This type of splitter window is called a "static
splitter." The CSplitterWnd class contains member functions that allow the
splitter bar to be dragged by the mouse or moved using the keyboard to change
the proportionate sizes of the views (or panes, in splitter terminology) within
the frame.

Sometimes it is desirable to fix the initial position of the splitter bars and
not allow the user to move them. This can be accomplished simply by deriving a
class from CSplitterWnd and overriding several members. This method is outlined
below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Use ClassWizard to create a new class named CMySplitterWnd of class type
   "generic CWnd" and change the references to CWnd in the class declaration and
   BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP macro to CSplitterWnd.

2. Using ClassWizard, create message handlers for WM_LBUTTONDOWN, WM_LBUTTONUP,
   WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK, and WM_MOUSEMOVE. Bypass the CSplitterWnd functionality in
   each of these overrides by calling the corresponding CWnd handlers. The
   following example illustrates the WM_LBUTTONDOWN handler:

         void CMySplitterWnd::OnLButtonDown(UINT nFlags, Cpoint point)
         {
            CWnd::OnLButtonDown(nFlags, point);
         }

3. Change any embedded CSplitterWnd members of your frame class to type
   CMySplitterWnd.

4. Remove any menu items that generate a ID_WINDOW_SPLIT command (such as the
   "Split" item on the VIEWEX sample's "Window" menu). This prevents
   CView::OnSplitCmd() from being called.
