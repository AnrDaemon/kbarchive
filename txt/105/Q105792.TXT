-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The memory test performed by HIMEM.SYS version 3.10 may fail (possibly causing
your system to stop responding [hang]) if your machine uses a hardware cache
controller.

CAUSE
=====

Some hardware cache controllers do not handle 16-megabyte and 32-megabyte memory
boundaries well. As a result, the HIMEM.SYS memory test fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, disable the hardware cache controller or contact
your hardware vendor for assistance.
