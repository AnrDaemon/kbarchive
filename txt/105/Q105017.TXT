The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Administrators can use the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 program X400ADM.EXE
to set the Gateway parameters. These parameters are split into two sections:
Outbound and Inbound. The Outbound section is used for messages bound for an
external X.400 MTA; Inbound is used for messages incoming to Microsoft Mail.

The X400ADM program replaces the command line switches used in earlier versions
of the gateway.

OUTBOUND MESSAGE PARAMETERS
---------------------------

 - Enable Encapsulation

 - Include Special Attachment

 - Include Attachment Name

Enable Encapsulation
--------------------

This enables backboning to another Microsoft Mail destination over X.400, and
support for such things as OLE objects.

Include Special Attachment
--------------------------

When backboning to another Microsoft Mail destination, this allows the inclusion
of a special attachment from Microsoft Mail for Windows which includes
information on attachment icons, display locations and time stamps.

Include Attachment Name
-----------------------

This includes another attachment for X.400 location listing the names of
attachments.

INBOUND MESSAGE PARAMETERS
--------------------------

 - Maximum Message Size

 - NetBIOS Notification

Maximum Message Size
--------------------

This allows you to limit the size of inbound message bodies. Message bodies that
exceed the limit are converted to attachments.

NetBIOS Notification
--------------------

This provides for the use of NetBIOS, if it is present, to instantly notify
recipients who are Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation users.
