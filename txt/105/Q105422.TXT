-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start FoxPackage, you receive the error message

   Sorry, Can't do that because OUT OF MEMORY!

CAUSE
=====

This error message is caused by an incompatibility between versions of
FoxPackage earlier than version 2.07 and the Macintosh's System 7.x 32-bit
addressing feature.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, do one of the following:

 - Upgrade to FoxPackage version 2.07. This version is compatible with the
   Macintosh's System 7.x 32-bit addressing feature. FoxPackage 2.07 is
   available from Microsoft Support Services through Application Note FM0796.
   For information on obtaining Application Note FM0796, query on the word
   "FM0796" here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

-or-

 - Turn off the Macintosh's 32-bit addressing feature in the Memory Control
   Panel that is found in the System Folder. For the change to take effect, the
   Macintosh must be restarted after 32-bit addressing is turned off in the
   control panel.
