TITLE   :DoubleSpace Automount Fails After You Free a Drive Letter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

If DoubleSpace attempts to automatically mount a drive and fails (due to lack of
available drive letters), subsequent attempts also fail even if you free up
additional drive letters.

CAUSE
=====

This situation occurs when DoubleSpace doesn't detect a disk change after the
drive letter is made available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this situation, remove the removable media disk from the drive,
reinsert it, and then issue a command that will allow DoubleSpace to mount the
drive (for example, DIR A:).


Additional query words: 6.20 floppy disk diskette automount
