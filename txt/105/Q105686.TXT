TITLE   :Deleting Windows 3.1 After Installing Windows NT

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you install Windows NT 3.1 or Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server over Windows 3.1
or Windows for Workgroups 3.1, the Windows NT files are installed to a
subdirectory under the existing WINDOWS directory called SYSTEM32.

NOTE: The original Microsoft Windows directory may be called WIN31 or any number
of other names because it is user-configurable, but for the purposes of this
article, WINDOWS is the assumed name of the directory.

Some files from the original Windows 3.1 installation are used by the Windows NT
operating system, however, and should not be deleted. This article describes how
to remove the original Windows installation without affecting Windows NT, to
help maximize your available disk space.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: This information applies only to Window NT 3.1. If you remove the files
indicated in this article from your computer running a later version of Windows
NT, for example, Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51, Windows NT stops functioning properly.

Windows NT 3.1 and Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server use the existing fonts
installed in the SYSTEM subdirectory, so you should not remove any of the .FOT,
.TTF, or .FON files from the existing SYSTEM subdirectory.

In addition, many Microsoft and third-party manufacturer' applications store
various .DLL files in the WINDOWS directory and the SYSTEM subdirectory. Windows
NT does not require these files, but the individual application that initially
installed them may require them to operate properly.

If you have stored any data files (such as with Notepad or Paintbrush) in the
WINDOWS directory, these files should be backed up or copied to a different
location. It is also a good idea to have backup copies of all .INI and .GRP
files in the WINDOWS directory, because new users will not be able to migrate
Windows 3.1 settings without these files. Once all these files have been backed
up or copied, the remainder of the files in the WINDOWS directory can be safely
removed without affecting the base Windows NT installation.

Important: If you delete files required by a Windows application, you might have
to reinstall that application in order for it to work properly. The safest way
to do this is to keep backup copies of the files.
