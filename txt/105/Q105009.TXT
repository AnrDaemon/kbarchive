TITLE   :PRB: "Record out of Range" Error When Modifying Report
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5x,2.6x,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the MODIFY REPORT command is issued in a compact executable file and the
report to be modified is an MS-DOS-style report, one the following error
messages occur:

   FoxPro 2.x for Windows: "Record out of range."

   Visual FoxPro for Windows: "Report file is invalid."

RESOLUTION
==========

Under FoxPro 2.x for Window, resolve this problem by runing the transporter on
the report before modifying the report.

For example, insert the following line in the program shown below in the "More
Information" section as the first line of code:

      DO TRANSPRT.FXP WITH "RPT25.FRX", 13

This line causes the transporter program, TRANSPRT.PRG, to be called prior to
modification of the report.

Save the program, rebuild the executable, and rerun the .EXE file. The Transport
dialog box appears, the report is transported, and the Report Writer is launched
with the transported report. Note that the transporter program is included in
the project and thus built into your application.

NOTE: Under Visual FoxPro for Windows, open the report files by choosing Open
from the File menu. This automatically calls the converter utility.

================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In FoxPro for MS-DOS, create a quick report. Save the report as RPT25.FRX.

2. Open FoxPro for Windows.

3. Create a new project and add to the project a program that contains the
   following code:

         MODIFY REPORT RPT25.FRX

4. Save the project and build an executable file.

5. Run the executable file from Program Manager or File Manager. The following
   error message appears:

   Record out of range. Cancel or Ignore.
