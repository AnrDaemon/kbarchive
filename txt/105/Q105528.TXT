KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Mozart, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you minimize Mozart while the Glossary is open, the Glossary will be in front
of the main Mozart window when you restore Mozart. This occurs even if the
Glossary was behind the main Mozart window when you minimized the application.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mozart version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Press the Glossary button.

2. Click Mozart's main window (the Glossary disappears behind the main window).

3. Press Mozart's minimize button.

4. Double click the minimized Mozart icon to restore the application.

Mozart is restored with the Glossary on top, even though the Glossary was in back
when the application was minimized.
