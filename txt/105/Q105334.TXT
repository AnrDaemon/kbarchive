The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

MemMaker removes question mark characters (?) from commands in your CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

CAUSE
=====

MemMaker does not have the ability to analyze your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
files without removing the question mark characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, edit your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files after
you run MemMaker and add the question mark characters.

For more information on using the question mark in your startup files, type "help
config.sys" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
press ENTER.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS version 6.2. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.20 special character
