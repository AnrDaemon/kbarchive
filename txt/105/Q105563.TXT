TITLE   :Mozart: Mozart Hangs when Restored from Program Manager Icon
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Mozart, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Normally, if Mozart is running but is minimized, you can restore it (maximize it
again) by clicking the Mozart icon in Program Manager. However, if Mozart has
received a Windows alert, trying to restore it using this method may cause
Mozart to stop responding (hang).

This problem may occur if after you receive an alert (any Windows error message
box with a yellow exclamation mark), you minimize Mozart and try to restore it
with the Program Manager icon.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mozart version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, don't try to restore Mozart from the icon in Program
Manager if you have received a Windows error message. Instead, restore Mozart
either by double-clicking the minimized icon in the lower-left corner of the
screen, or by using the Task List (press CTRL+ESC).
