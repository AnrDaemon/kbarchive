TITLE   :Windows Err Msg: Not Enough Environment Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
The following information applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you start the MS-DOS Prompt or
an MS-DOS-based application:

   Not Enough Environment Space

CAUSE
=====

The above error message may occur if you are running Novell NetWare and have not
installed Windows with Novell connectivity, or if the MS-DOS-based application
you are trying to run requires more than 256 bytes of environment space.

WORKAROUND
==========

 - If Windows 3.0 or later is running on a Novell NetWare network, make sure
   that the appropriate network selection is made in Windows Setup.

 - If the MS-DOS-based application requires more than 256 bytes of environment
   space and you are running Windows 3.1 or later, add the following line to the
   SYSTEM.INI file under the [NonWindowsApp] section:

      [NonWindowsApp]
      CommandEnvSize=1024

   1024 bytes should work properly; however, the setting can be set as high as
   32,768 bytes. The value must be either zero or between 160 and 32768.

   This is a global setting that affects all virtual machines (VMs).


 - With Windows 2.x and later, you can create a program information file (PIF)
   to increase the environment space for the single application. Use the
   following settings in the PIF:

   For Windows 3.0:
   ----------------

   Field                          Setting
   =====                          =======

   Program FileName               Command.COM
   Window Title                   My Program
   Optional Parameters            /e:2048 /c C:\mydir\myprog.exe
   Startup Directory              C:\mydir

   For Windows 2.x:
   ----------------

   Field                          Setting
   =====                          =======

   Program Name                   Command.COM
   Program Title                  My Program
   Program Parameters             /e:2048 /c C:\mydir\myprog.exe
   Initial Directory              C:\mydir

   "/e:2048" is the size of the environment space in bytes; this value also
   ranges from 160 to 32768.

   "Mydir" is the name of the directory that contains the executable of the
   program.

   "Myprog.exe" is the name of the program.

   "/C" specifies that the command processor is to execute MYPROG.EXE and then
   terminate itself.
