MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing XTree for Windows
----------------------------

When you install XTree for Windows, you receive a Welcome screen that gives you
the option to Continue, Exit or view the README file. If you choose to view the
README file, the file (opened in Notepad) will flicker on the screen for an
instant and then disappear. In order to view the file, you can press ALT+TAB to
switch to Notepad-README.TXT, then close it or press ALT+TAB to return to the
XTree Setup when you have finished viewing the file, or you can press CTRL+ESC
to bring up the Task List and then Switch to Notepad-README.TXT.

Cannot Install Command Center as the Windows Shell
--------------------------------------------------

When you install XTree for Windows, you have the option to Convert Program
Manager groups to CommandBars, customize which CommandBars startup
automatically, and install the Command Center as the Windows Shell. If you
choose to Convert Program Manager groups, you will not receive an error message,
but no groups will be converted. Similarly, when you choose to install the
Command Center as the Windows Shell, you will not receive an error message, but
the Command Center will not replace Program Manager as the shell. Windows NT
uses a 32-bit application, Program Manager, as its shell. Also, if you choose to
customize which CommandBars load automatically (select Customize Autoload during
XTree Setup), you will not see any of your groups listed in the list of
available CommandBars to load automatically.

For additional information, call XTree technical support (Executive Systems) at
(800) 964-2490.

XTree Gold for Windows is manufactured by the XTree Company, a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
