The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows allows you to change
the time interval in which Schedule+ polls your calendar file on the server by
adding the following line to the SCHDPLUS.INI file

   ReminderPollTime=X

where X is the number of minutes the user's workstation polls the server calendar
file for an appointment.

By default, Schedule+ Reminders polls your calendar file on the server every 1
minute. If you are connecting to your postoffice via a Remote Access Service
(RAS), setting this parameter to 60 minutes or more will speed up Schedule+'s
performance by only reminding you of appointments every 60 minutes.

Additional query words: schedule plus 1.00 1.00a default
