======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to modify a folder (private or shared) in versions 3.0, 3.0b, or
3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation, an error message may
be displayed:

   Notice 64 Failure to modify folder rights

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by the corresponding folder file missing or having
read-only attributes.

RESOLUTION
==========

The folder file for that folder can be determined by doing a debug on
FOLDROOT.IDX if it is a public folder, or on the user's eight digit IDX file if
it is a private folder.

If the .FLD file exists, check the attributes and remove the read-only attribute
if it has been set. If the .FLD is missing, the file can be restored from the
backup.

However, if a backup is not available, then in order to delete the folder, the
user should create a new folder and copy the new .FLD file to the
<8digit>.FLD that is missing.

For example, if the missing folder file is 00000010.FLD and the new folder
created is 00000011.FLD, then copy 00000011.FLD to 00000010.FLD. The file size
for the new folder should be 129 bytes. Now you will be able to delete the
folder.
