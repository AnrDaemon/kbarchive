The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 differs from previous versions of
Windows (including Windows for Workgroups 3.1) with respect to the requirements
for, and the limitations of, network server-based shared installations (that is,
SETUP /A and SETUP /N installations).

This article is intended to provide system administrators with some guidelines
for performing such installations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you set up a server-based shared installation of Windows for Workgroups
3.11, be aware of the following:

 - In the Microsoft LAN Manager and Windows NT environment (or any network
   requiring the installation of the real-mode Windows for Workgroups 3.11
   redirector prior to accessing the server with the shared, SETUP /A,
   directory), Windows for Workgroups 3.11 nodes have client functionality
   only.

   NOTE: Because Novell NetWare requires its own real-mode redirector (giving the
   node access to the shared directory before loading Windows for Workgroups and
   its peer-to-peer network components), this limitation may not exist in
   integrated Windows for Workgroups 3.11/NetWare environments.

 - When running SETUP /N to a workstation from a Novell server, the Windows for
   Workgroups Setup program requires that Novell's Windows support files exist
   in the shared directory on the server (that is, the directory created with
   SETUP /A). The following files need to be copied to the shared Windows
   directory prior to running SETUP /N:

   NETWARE.DRV
   NETWARE.HLP
   NWPOPUP.EXE
   VNETWARE.386
   VIPX.386

   NOTE: Other third-party networks may present the same restrictions; refer to
   your network product documentation or vendor for more information.

Novell NetWare is manufactured by Novell, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
