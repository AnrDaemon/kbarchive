======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

To use Remote Access Service (RAS) 1.1a Client software with Windows
3.1 to connect to a Windows NT RAS Server, you must first install
Microsoft Network Client software. One option is to install Workgroup
Connections for MS-DOS and allow the stand-alone Windows 3.1 computer
to then be able to install and use the RAS 1.1a Client software.

Use the following procedure to install RAS 1.1a Client software on a
standalone Windows 3.1 machine with Workgroup Connections:

1. Outside of Windows 3.1, install Workgroup Connections for MS-DOS by typing in
   A:\setup.

2. Select No Network Adapter during the installation. (It may also be advisable
   to not install the Mail files to save on hard disk space).

3. After the installation is complete, restart the computer for the changes to
   take effect.

4. Place the RAS Client Setup disk in drive A, start Windows 3.1, and from the
   Program Manager window, choose Run from the File menu, type the following in
   the Command Line field and then choose OK:

   A:\SETUP

5. After the installation is complete, create an icon for the RAS 1.1a Client
   software that executes the RASPHONE.EXE file.

6. Quit Windows 3.1, switch to the Windows directory, and run SETUP.EXE to enter
   MS-DOS mode maintenance setup for Windows.

7. Select the Network setting and change it from No Network Installed to
   Microsoft Network (or 100% Compatible).

8. After quitting Setup, restart the computer and restart Windows 3.1 and the
   RAS 1.1a Client software should be installed properly.
