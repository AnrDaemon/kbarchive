TITLE   :FIX: CommitQQ Does Not Flush Buffers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Calling CommitQQ after writing data will not force the data to be written to the
physical device. Any data in the buffer that was not already written to the
device will remain in the buffer.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only way to flush the write buffer is to close the I/O unit and then re-open
it. For sequential files the status should be "APPEND" when re-opening.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was fixed in Fortran PowerStation 32
for Windows NT, version 1.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem can be demonstrated as follows:

1. Build the sample program TCOMMIT.FOR in the \F32\SAMPLES\RUNTIME directory,
   and run the executable from Windows.

2. Type in some text when asked. When the program displays "If you boot now,
   your text will be saved," go to File Manager.

3. In File Manager, display the directory \F32\SAMPLES\RUNTIME with full file
   details.

4. Press the <F5> key to refresh (ensuring that the latest information
   about the files is being displayed).

5. Check the size of 'COMMITQQ.TST.'

6. The size of 'COMMITQQ.TST' will still be zero indicating that the write
   buffers were not flushed despite calling the CommitQQ function. Go back to
   the TCOMMIT program, and press the <Enter> key twice to exit.

7. Repeat steps 3, 4, and 5. The size of 'COMMITQQ.TST' will no longer be zero.
   This indicates that the write buffers were flushed only when the file unit
   was closed on program termination.
