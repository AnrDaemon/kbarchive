TITLE   :PC DirSync: Address Deleted After Dir-Sync Import or Resync
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, an external address
that was defined on the local postoffice may be missing from the external
postoffice address list (POL).

This problem may occur if the external address was defined on the local
postoffice by using the External-Admin, List function in the Mail Administrator
program (ADMIN.EXE). If the address does not exist on the directory
synchronization server, the address will disappear only after you do one of the
following:

 - Run the Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Import command

-or-

 - Create a RESYNC.GLB file via IMPORT.EXE and copy this file to the requestor
   postoffice, followed by a complete directory synchronization (Dir-Sync)
   cycle.

Again, this problem only occurs if that external address name is not already
defined on the Dir-Sync server postoffice. This will be true of all external
postoffices and all gateway names, if the gateway type is selected for Dir-Sync
under Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Types for the requestor.

CAUSE
=====

The Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Import
command instructs the Dir-Sync server to send its own complete set of address
lists to the requestor. This information is then used to build new address files
containing only the address information that existed on the Dir-Sync server.
Therefore, Dir-Sync will remove any addresses that were added to that external
postoffice's or gateway's address list via the local administrator.

Creating the RESYNC.GLB file has the same result as using the Config, Dir-Sync,
Requestor, Import command, except that the RESYNC.GLB file is copied manually to
the requestor postoffice. The effect is the same; however, the address files are
rebuilt from scratch, and the locally defined external addresses or gateway
addresses are lost.

RESOLUTION
==========

After the Dir-Sync cycle has completed, use ADMIN.EXE to add the missing address
to the external address list or the gateway list of the requestor. Do this after
you run each Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Import command and after each
RESYNC.GLB file has been processed. To place this external address name into the
Global Address List (GAL), REBUILD.EXE must be run after the name has been added
to the external address list or the gateway list.

It may be advantageous to add the address to the directory synchronization
server's external address list as well, to prevent this problem from occurring.
However, the address will be propagated to all of the requestors whenever the
Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Import command is run.
