MORE INFORMATION

*************************************************************************
***
;
; This file specifies the programs that MEMMAKER should either ignore
; or disable during the optimization process. You can have MEMMAKER
; ignore or disable device drivers, memory-resident programs (TSRs),
; or applications.
;
; Other features provided by this file include the ability to change the
; default behavior of MEMMAKER and the ability to move or keep a file at
; the top of the config.sys file.
;
;  Use the following guidelines when editing this file:
;
;  * To have MEMMAKER ignore a program, add the program name to this file
;    and insert an asterisk (*) before the program name. MemMaker will
;    not attempt to load that program into the upper memory area. The
;    program will be loaded into conventional memory during and after
;    the optimization process.
;
;  * To have MemMaker disable a program during optimization, add the
;    program name to this file, but do not insert an asterisk before its
;    name. MemMaker will disable the program by using the REM command
;    so the program will not be loaded during the optimization process.
;    When optimization is complete, MemMaker removes the REM command
;    so that the program starts as usual.
;
;  * To have MemMaker use different default for an option, delete the
;    semicolon and space in front of the # sign. For example to have
;    MemMaker use more aggressive settings as its default, delete the
;    semicolon and space in front of #HIGHSCAN There are seven settings
;    all found in the default options section below.
;
;  * To have MemMaker move a program to the top of CONFIG.SYS, add the
;    program name to this file, and insert a carat (^) before the program
;    name.  This program will then be loaded into memory before HIMEM.SYS
;    and EMM386.EXE, and so will not be loaded into upper memory.  This
;    is useful for drivers for certain disk drives that must be activated
;    before upper memory is enabled.
;
;  * Begin each statement at the left margin.
;
;  * List each program without its file extension.
;
;  * To insert a comment, start that line with a semi-colon (;).
