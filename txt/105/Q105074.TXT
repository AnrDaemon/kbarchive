SUMMARY
=======


1. Q. How can I repartition my hard disk into one large partition?

   A. Changing your hard disk from multiple partitions to a single partition
   involves backing up your program and data files, repartitioning your hard
   disk, and then restoring your program and data files. For specific
   instructions, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q106423 Repartitioning Your Hard Disk to Upgrade to 6.0 or 6.2

2. Q. I have a hard disk with more than 1024 cylinders. Is there a way to access
   and use the entire hard disk?

   A. MS-DOS 6.2 uses the hardware BIOS to read and write to the hard disk drive.
   Due to the limitations of the standard ROM BIOS, MS- DOS accesses only the
   first 1024 cylinders of a physical hard disk. If you have repartitioned and
   formatted your hard disk after upgrading to MS-DOS 6.2 and the disk has less
   space available, consult your hardware manual or contact your hardware
   manufacturer for more information.

3. Q. When I run the Fdisk program, it does not recognize all the disk space on
   my hard disk. What is causing this problem?

   A. Fdisk relies on the BIOS to report the hard disk size. If Fdisk incorrectly
   reports that your hard disk is smaller than it actually is, either your BIOS
   is set for the wrong drive type (that is, it is set incorrectly or it does
   not support your specific drive's dimensions), or your drive has more than
   1024 cylinders.

   Contact your hardware manufacturer to determine if your BIOS is set correctly.
   If it is not, correcting the setting should allow Fdisk to recognize the
   entire hard disk. If your BIOS does not support your drive type and your hard
   disk doesn't exceed 1024 cylinders, you may need to order a new BIOS from
   your hardware manufacturer.
