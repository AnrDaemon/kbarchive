The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When information is entered in a character field in a database through an @ ...
EDIT command and the RETURN key is pressed in the edit region during the input
process, a carriage return and a linefeed are added to the text. These control
codes can cause problems if the text field must be written out to a text file or
another databases without control codes in the field.

To remove the carriage returns and linefeeds and replace them with a space in
both FoxPro for MS-DOS and Windows, enter the following code either in the
Command window or in a program

      REPLACE ALL <fieldname> WITH STRTRAN(<fieldname>,CHR(13)+CHR(10),' ')

where <fieldname> is the name of the database field that contains the
carriage returns and linefeeds.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the database is browsed in FoxPro for MS-DOS, you can view control codes in
the fields. In the active record, the field will contain two accented characters
together, an "i" and an "e" representing the carriage return and linefeed. In
the other records in the Browse window, a musical note and a circle in a box
represents the carriage return and linefeed. In FoxPro for Windows, the carriage
return and linefeed are represented by two vertical bars in all records in the
Browse window.

Additional query words: VFoxWin FoxDos FoxWin get line feed cr/lf
