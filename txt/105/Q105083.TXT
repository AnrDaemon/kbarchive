TITLE   :Unable to Log in on Windows NT Advanced Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Advanced Server may not be able to log in a user if the NetLogon
service is not running on the system. Although the initial login screen is
displayed, if you attempt to login, you may receive a message indicating that
Windows NT Advanced Server was unable to validate the user because the NetLogon
service is not running or started.

CAUSE
=====

One of the reasons for the NetLogon service not starting could be due to the
presence of a duplicate Windows NT Advanced Server computer name on the
network.

Another cause could be incorrect settings for the Network Interface Card (NIC).

RESOLUTION
==========

Disconnect the Windows NT Advanced Server computer from the network. It should
now be possible to successfully log in to Windows NT Advanced Server. Change the
computer name using the Network icon in the Control Panel.

Other causes may require reinstallation.
