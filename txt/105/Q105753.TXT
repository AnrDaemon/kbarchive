SYMPTOMS

When you start an MS-DOS-based application, you may receive the following error
message:

   Unable to Play Sound: Sound Blaster is In Use by Another Application.

This error may occur if you have a Sound Blaster card installed, but its virtual
sound device driver (Vsbpd.386) is not listed in the [386enh] section of the
System.ini file.

NOTE: This problem does not occur when using Windows 95 and the Windows 95 Sound
Blaster driver.

To correct this problem, make sure that the driver Vsbpd.386 is installed and
listed in the System.ini file as follows:

   [386enh]
