    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2

SUMMARY
=======

While reading a message created with a version 1.0 Microsoft Electronic Forms
Designer custom form, you may notice that incorrect information is displayed in
a subform. This problem can occur if E-Form caching is turned on and the Hide
method in Microsoft Visual Basic was used to dismiss the window. To properly use
subforms with caching turned on, the Visual Basic Unload method should be used
to dismiss the forms.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, you can create a custom form to
include subforms that are displayed in addition to the form's main window. You
can use two methods to dismiss a subform in Visual Basic: Hide and Unload. The
Hide method simply removes the dialog box from view; Unload removes the dialog
box from memory.

When E-Form caching is turned on, it is important that you use the Unload method
to dismiss subforms. Otherwise, if you use the Hide method, when a message of
the same message class is read, the first instance of the subform will always be
displayed because it is cached in memory. The Unload command removes the subform
from memory and therefore allows each message to perform as expected.

For more information on subforms, see pages 95-102 of the Microsoft Electronic
Forms Designer "Developer's Guide."
