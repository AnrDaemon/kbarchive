KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you exit Windows 3.1 in 386
enhanced mode:

   Group File Error
   The program group file has been modified by another program or user and will
   be reloaded; try the operation again.

Choosing the OK button has no effect; the only course of action is to reboot your
machine.

NOTE: This error has not been reproduced in standard mode.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by either of the following:

 - Two groups with the same name exist in the [Groups] section of the
   PROGMAN.INI file. For example:

         [Groups]
         Group9=c:\win\apps.grp
         Group8=c:\win\apps.grp

 - Two groups with the same number exist in the [Groups] section of the
   PROGMAN.INI file. For example:

         [Groups]
         Group7=c:\win\apps.grp
         Group7=c:\win\main.grp

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Exit Windows and open the PROGMAN.INI file in a text editor, such as MS-DOS
   Editor.

2. Remove any duplicate group name(s), and/or change any duplicate group
   number(s) in the [Groups] section.

3. Modify the ORDER= line in the [Settings] section so that there are no
   duplicate or extra numbers.

If there are no duplicate groups names or group numbers, rename the PROGMAN.INI
file and then rebuild the file. For instructions on rebuilding the PROGMAN.INI
file, query in the Microsoft Knowledge Base on the following words:

   progman.ini and rebuild and groups and setup

Additional query words: 3.10 3.1 3.11
