The Brother HL-8e may need a firmware update to correctly print
TrueType fonts from Windows NT. Problems may include dropped or
garbled characters when printing TrueType fonts.


According to Brother's technical support, if the printer firmware is
dated earlier than 8/92, it should be updated to a version dated at
least 8/24/92 to correct known problems with TrueType fonts.

Use the following procedure to determine the firmware revision of your
printer:

1. Power off the printer.

2. Holding the Fonts button down, power up the printer.

3. While still holding the Fonts button, wait until the power up sequence is
   completed, then the firmware version will be displayed.

For additional information, call Brother technical support at (800)

The HL-8e Printer is manufactured by Brother, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
