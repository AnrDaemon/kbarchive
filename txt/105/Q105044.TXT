TITLE   :ERR: "File Does Not Exist" After Source Code Is Removed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fox Miscellaneous Products
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.01
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive the

   File does not exist

error message when using FoxRun or MFoxRun to run (DO) a program that has had its
source code removed using FoxPackage. Looking at the program file after it has
been modified by FoxPackage reveals that the program file has a file size of 0K
(zero kilobytes).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a problem with FoxPackage version 2.05.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to FoxPackage version 2.07 to correctly remove the source code from
programs and run them with FoxRun.

FoxPackage 2.07 is available through Application Note FM0796. For more
information on obtaining this Application Note, query on the word "FMO796"
(without the quotation marks) here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FoxPackage can prepare programs for distribution in two ways. One way is to
create a single stand-alone application. The other way is to remove the source
code from the program files. This article addresses the latter method--removing
source code from program files.

As explained in Chapter 7 of the FoxBASE+/Mac "User's Guide," FoxBASE+ program
files can have the source code removed from them so that the only part of the
file remaining is the compiled resource portion. This resource portion of the
file can be distributed with FoxRun along with supporting databases and indexes.
