SUMMARY
=======

When you implement free and busy times for Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS
and OfficeVision, you must set up the VM operating system to support cross
calendaring so that your PROFS calendar can communicate with the calendar of a
virtually or physically remote PROFS system. There are several ways to set it
up:

   RSCS
   TSAF
   SPPC
   VTAM service machine (AVSVM)

This article gives some rules for using RSCS. Please contact IBM for information
on the other methods.

TO SET UP CROSS CALENDARING
---------------------------

 - Set up the REMCAL file with an "R" following the "Y" or "T" used to
   distinguish between PROFS and OfficeVision.

   Example:

       PO_NODE  MSCAL    MSCYR

 - Add this reroute statement to the MS-RSCS CONFIG file on the MSRSCS machine:

      REROUTE ALL <po_node_name>  MS-CAL TO  <MS-RSCS node name>    MS-CAL

 - Add this spool statement to the PROFILE EXEC of the MSCAL ID:

       CP SPOOL PUNCH FORM MS-CAL DIST <po_node name>

These steps allow you use cross calendaring to view users' free and busy times.
