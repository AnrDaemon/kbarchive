The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Backup and Microsoft Backup for Windows may fail and generate
"insufficient disk space" error messages when you are backing up to a network
drive, even if the drive has plenty of room. This problem occurs if the network
connection times out when Microsoft Backup is trying to increase the size of the
backup file.

CAUSE
=====

When Microsoft Backup allocates space for a backup file, it fills the file with
zeros. If the file increases by several megabytes, it may take several minutes
to "zero out" the new space. If the network redirector determines that the
network is not responding (because this process is taking so long), the
redirector may cancel the network connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, increase your network timeout setting to several
minutes. For example, if you are using Windows for Workgroups, increase the
SESSTIMEOUT=nnn entry in the [network] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
