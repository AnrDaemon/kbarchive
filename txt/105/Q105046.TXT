The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can quit Microsoft Windows from within an application written in FoxPro by
using the Windows Application Programming Interface (API) through Foxtools.fll,
a library file included with FoxPro.

This code does not work under Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT 4.0 because
there is no ExitWindows entry point in User32.exe on Win32 Operating Systems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: While it is possible to quit Windows from within a FoxPro program by
making use of the Windows API function ExitWindows(), FoxPro will not do a
complete cleanup and can leave .TMP files in your TEMP subdirectory.

1. In a program, open the FOXTOOLS.FLL external library. To do this, use the SET
   LIBRARY TO command as follows to ensure that the program finds the
   FOXTOOLS.FLL library in the FoxPro directory: SET LIBRARY TO
   SYS(2004)+"FOXTOOLS.FLL" ADDITIVE

2. Register the Windows API functions that you would like to call. In this case,
   use the ExitWindows() API call: getout=REGFN("ExitWindows","II","I")

3. To completely quit Microsoft Windows and all applications running under
   Windows, issue the following command: =CALLFN(getout,0,0)

NOTE: In Windows 95, this procedure displays the Shut Down the Computer dialog
box, then exits from Windows.
