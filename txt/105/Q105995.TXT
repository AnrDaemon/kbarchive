TITLE   :AT Command May Fail Copying Files to a LAN Manager Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.1,3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the AT command to schedule a batch file that copies files to a
Microsoft LAN Manager server in a different domain, the batch file may fail and
you will receive an "Access Denied" error message. However, if you execute the
batch file from a command prompt, it successfully copies the files without
generating an error message.

Sample batch file:

   Net Use z: \\LMServer\Share
   copy test.txt z:\
   Net Use z: /d

CAUSE
=====

Without domain information for the user account, using the AT command does not
succeed. This is because the account it is trying to validate is the SYSTEM
account. By default, the Schedule service uses the SYSTEM account for access
rights.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two workarounds for this problem:

 - Supply domain information for the user in the NET USE command, such as the
   following

   Net Use z: \\LMServer\share password /USER:LMDomain\<guest>

   where <guest> must be a valid account in the "LMDomain" domain.

 - Have the Schedule Service log on as a valid account on that LAN Manager
   server by doing the following:

   1. In Control Panel, double-click the Services icon.

   2. Click the Schedule service, and then click Startup.

   3. Type the user account on the LAN Manager server (which matches a local
      account) with sufficient rights and type the appropriate password.

   4. Restart the service so the changes take effect.

   This option does not require changing the command line and will be permanent
   unless it is changed.
