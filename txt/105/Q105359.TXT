TITLE   :Filenames with Trailing Periods Not Found
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to move, delete, copy, or rename a file whose name contains a
trailing period (such as README.), you will receive one of the following error
messages.

If you are using File Manager:

   File Manager cannot move <filename and path>: The system cannot find
   the file specified. Make sure the correct path and filename are specified and
   the network is started.

If you are at a command prompt:

   The system cannot find the file specified file.

   -or-

   Could not Find <filename and path>.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT cannot handle filenames with trailing periods. The only known way
that Windows NT allows a file to have a trailing period is if the file was
named/created by a Macintosh. In this case, the Windows NT Advanced Server must
be running, or has run, Services for the Macintosh.

Macintosh users can name a file with a trailing period. That file may then be
copied to Windows NT Advanced Server, but Windows NT Advanced Server will not
remove the period, nor will the name translation process to 8.3 take care of the
problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

The file should be renamed from a Macintosh, so that it does not contain a
trailing period.

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Server version 3.5.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Windows NT Server version 3.5.
