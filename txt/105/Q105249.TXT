TITLE   :Serial Printers May Print Garbage During Windows NT Startup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a printer is attached to the serial port (COMx) of a system running Windows
NT, the printer may eject blank pages or print garbage during the startup of
Windows NT.

CAUSE
=====

When you start Windows NT, NTDETECT gathers information on the hardware that is
installed in the system. One of the functions that NTDETECT performs is a search
for the pointing device (usually a mouse). In the course of this process, data
is sent to the serial ports. This data may be interpreted by the printer as
incoming information upon which to act. Depending on the baud rate setting and
the particular printer attached, this may result in the ejection of printed
pages with random characters or unprinted pages.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make sure that the power is off on the printer
before you start Windows NT. After Windows NT is loaded, then turn the printer
back on.

You can also specify "/noserialmice:com(n)" on the BOOT.INI file.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1 and
Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in the
latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version
3.1. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
