SUMMARY
=======

It is not possible to install two separate MIDI cards on the same system if they
both are the same model and both use the same driver. If both devices have the
same name, as listed in the Drivers section of the Control Panel (for example,
"SoundBlasterPro FM MIDI Synth,"), Windows cannot install both devices.
Additionally, the MIDI Mapper will have difficulty pointing to the correct port
if the two devices both have the same name.

However, if the two cards are different models and use two different drivers, it
is possible to install and use both of them. In this case, make sure that they
each use a different interrupt (IRQ) and I/O address.
