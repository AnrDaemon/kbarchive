======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may occur when you load the Windows for Workgroups
NET command:

   Error 3653: The protocol manager could not be found.

CAUSE
=====

The above error message is displayed when PROTMAN.DOS does not load. The
following are some reasons why PROTMAN.DOS may not load:

 - The line DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\PROTMAN.DOS /I:C:\WINDOWS is not in the CONFIG.SYS
   file or is remarked out.

 - The /I: parameter does not point to the location where PROTOCOL.INI is
   stored.

 - If you are using DoubleSpace, the DEVICE command for DoubleSpace may be
   located after the DEVICE command for PROTMAN.DOS in the CONFIG.SYS file.

 - If you upgraded to Windows for Workgroups 3.11, it is possible that the Setup
   program did not correctly update the NET.EXE file. This error occurs if the
   version 3.1 NET.EXE file is used with version 3.11. The correct NET.EXE file
   for Windows for Workgroup 3.11 has this file stamp:

     NET.EXE  433,829  11/1/93  3:11:00AM


 - If the NETADDRESS line in the PROTOCOL.INI file is entered incorrectly when
   you are using token ring network interface cards.


 - The PROTOCOL.INI file is corrupted. Rename the file and reinstall the network
   driver through Windows for Workgroups.

PROTMAN.DOS should display an error message at startup that may help indicate
what is causing the problem. If you have MS-DOS 6.0, you can view what error
message is being displayed when PROTMAN.DOS loads by pressing the F8 function
key. If you do NOT have MS-DOS 6.0, insert a PAUSE line at the top of the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
