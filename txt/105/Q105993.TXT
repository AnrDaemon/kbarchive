TITLE   :Unable to Print Directly to Ports from a Command Prompt
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Default Printer in Print Manager has the Print Directly To Ports option
selected, you will not be able to print from a Command Prompt (CMD.EXE) to a
local port.

NOTE: Printing from other applications such as Notepad or Write work correctly
with the Print Directly To Ports option selected.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server version
3.5.

The only workaround is to not use the Print Directly To Ports option with Print
Manager, and resend the print job.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in Windows NT
Workstation or Server version 3.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can control how Print Manager sends documents to the printer with the Print
Directly To Ports option. By default, a document is spooled to the hard disk
first, and then the spooler sends it to the printer. The spooler sends the
document to the printer in the background. If you want to bypass spooling, you
can print directly to the printer. However, you will have to wait until the
document is printed before continuing to work with your application. This option
is not available when a printer is shared.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. From Print Manager, select a default printer that is local.

2. Select Printer Properties, and then choose Details.

3. Select the Print Directly To Ports option.

   NOTE: This option is not available if the printer is shared.

4. Open a Command Prompt from the Main group and copy a file to a local port
   with a printer attached.

There will not be any error messages, but no printer output will occur.
