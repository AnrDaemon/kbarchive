SUMMARY
=======

The Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4 printer driver, HPPCL5E.DRV, does not save paper
tray selections.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The HPPCL5E.DRV printer driver supports the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4, 4M, 4SI,
and 4SI MX printers. If you change the Paper Source setting for your printer in
the Setup dialog box in Control Panel, the selection remains for that Windows
session but reverts back to the default Auto Select option when you reenter
Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this situation, edit the WIN.INI file and manually change the
"tray" selection in the [HP LaserJet 4/4M or 4SI/4SI MX] driver section to one
of the following:

   1  MP Tray
   2  Paper Cassette
   4  Manual Feed
   5  Envelope Feeder
   7  Auto Select
   11 Lower Cassette

For example:

      [HP LaserJet 4/4M,LPTx]
      paper=1
      prtcaps=-5240
      prtcps2=4561
      tray=1
