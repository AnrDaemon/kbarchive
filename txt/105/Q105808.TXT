TITLE   :FIX: Overflow in VB version 3.0 ICONWRKS Sample Program
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ICONWRKS (Icon Works) sample program that shipped with Visual Basic version
3.0 can fail with an "Overflow" error when you attempt to do a File+Open from
the Editor form, on some high-resolution monitors. ICONWRKS is installed by
default under the subdirectory \SAMPLES\ICONWRKS.

CAUSE
=====

ICONWRKS fails with "Overflow" in the Extract_Image_And_Mask procedure in
ICONWRKS.BAS on the following line:

   R = SetBitmapBits(editor.Pic_Image.Image, ImageSize, Lpicon + 12 + 128)

The statement DEFINT A-Z at the top of the module makes the variable R an
integer. However, the API function SetBitmapBits returns a Long Integer when run
on some high-resolution monitors.

NOTE: This problem may also occur on other lines with other API calls.

This sample program was developed under Visual Basic version 1.0 and was not
updated for 3.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, add the following statement to ICONWRKS.GBL:

      Global R As Long

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in Visual Basic
version 4.0.
