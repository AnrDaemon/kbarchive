TITLE   :Cannot use UNC Pathname for Working Directory in Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows NT, you cannot specify a UNC (universal naming convention) pathname
for the working directory of an icon for a 16-bit application. If you set a UNC
pathname as a working directory, you will not receive an error message
indicating that the working directory is invalid, but the directory specified
will not be the working directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this limitation, use the NT 3.x File Manager or NT 4.0 Network
Neighborhood icon to make a full connection to the desired share and specify
that drive as the working directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Using NT 3.x File Manager or NT 4.0 Explorer, share a directory either on the
   local computer or a remote computer.

2. In NT 3.x Program Manager, create an icon with the following properties:

   Command Line: WRITE.EXE Working Directory: \\computername\sharename

   - or -

3. On the NT 4.0 desktop, create a shortcut with the following properties:

   Target: %WINDIR%\WINHELP.EXE Start in: \\computername\sharename

4. Start the application using the new icon and choose Open from the File menu.

In the Directories list of the Open dialog box, you will not see the path to the
working directory specified in the Program Item Properties using the UNC
pathname, even though you did not receive any error messages.
