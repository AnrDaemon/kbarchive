SUMMARY
=======

When you are trying to locate character strings using the Visual FoxPro Query
Designer, or the FoxPro 2.x Relational Query By Example (RQBE) interface, the
percent sign (%) is used to find character strings in character fields, and the
dollar sign ($) is used to find character strings in memo fields.

Examples
--------

To search for a character string in a character field, the lines in the selection
criteria would resemble the following:

   Filename.fieldname        LIKE        %Stringtobefound%

To search for a string in a memo field, the lines in the selection criteria would
resemble the following:

   ('Stringtobefound'$fieldname) = .t.

Alternative Method
------------------

This method brings up records that contain the search string in any field.

1. Select "<expression...>" from the Field Name list box.

2. In the Expression text box of the Expression Builder dialog box, use one of
   the following statements:

   'Stringtobefound'

   -or-

   <variable_name>
