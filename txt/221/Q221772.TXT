TITLE   :"SNABase not started" if SNA Client for Windows NT is installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbPackage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a package created by the Systems Management Server Installer is used to
install the Windows NT Client for SNA Server, an error message, "SNABase not
Started," will occur upon attempting to open a session. If a NET STOP SNABASE
then a NET START SNABASE is executed, the connection will work correctly.
Another indication of the problem is that it is not possible to manipulate other
services in Control Panel, Services until the SNABASE service has timed out.

CAUSE
=====

When the Systems Management Server Installer creates the package, it does not
capture all of the necessary registry information. Specifically, two values are
missing from the following key:

   HKLM/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/SnaBase

   DependOnService: REG_MULTI_SZ: LanmanWorkstation NtLmSsp

   and

   DependOnGroup: REG_MULTI_SZ

The DependOnGroup has no associated value

WORKAROUND
==========

If the above entries are manually added to the Systems Management Server
package, then the installation will work properly. To avoid the issue, the
Windows NT Client for SNA Server 4.0 can be used in a silent install mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer 1.0.11 to 1.0.45.
