OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600 kbVS600sp3fix kbGrpDSFox

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The cursor does not work correctly, when typing Korean characters into a
textbox's ControlSource property.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

   Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

Running Visual FoxPro 6.0 on a Korean Operating system, such as Korean version
of Windows 95, when Korean characters are typed, the cursor changes to a solid
black square for certain characters. For example, when typing Korean Characters
in the command window, the cursor will change to a solid black square for some
of the characters. But, when Korean characters are typed in a TextBox's
ControlSource, the cursor does not change into a solid black square for any of
the characters.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add a textbox into the form.

3. Go to the Properties windows and select the textbox's ControlSource property.

4. Type Korean characters into the ControlSource box, on the Properties window.
   For example, type "RK SK EK FK" (without the quotation marks) (without
   spaces).

Note that as you type the characters, the cursor in the ControlSource box on the
Properties window does not turn to a solid black square. If you type the same
characters in the command window, then the cursor will change to a solid black
square.
