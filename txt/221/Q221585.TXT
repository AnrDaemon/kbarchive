PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0sp3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVS97sp3bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0sp3 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0sp3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling code with a default argument for a string parameter in a function
declaration results in the following:

   Test.cpp() : fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
                (compiler file 'msc1.cpp', line 1188)
       Please choose the Technical Support command on the Visual C++
       Help menu, or open the Technical Support help file for more information

CAUSE
=====

This bug was introduced in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 3. It was not in
earlier versions of Visual C++ 5.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either upgrade to Visual C++ 6.0, or define a string in the file before the
function declaration.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++, version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code demonstrates the problem and the workaround:

   #include <string>
   using namespace std ;

   // Uncomment the following line to work around the problem
   //static std::string empty = ""; 

   void test( string sname = "" );

   void main()
   {
      test( ) ;
   }

Note that the empty string declaration must be in the same translation unit as
the function declaration.
