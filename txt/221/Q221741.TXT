-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you include a header file containing an unknown variable to a form or class
using the Include File menu option, the following error occurs when saving the
file:

   Fatal error: Exception code=C0000005

This error does not occur if you use the #INCLUDE to add the header file to the
object.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create the following header file and call it Ztest.h:

   #IF UnknownVar
   #ENDIF

2. Create a new class based on a custom class. Include the Ztest.h header file
   using the Class menu pad and the Include File menu bar. Choose the Ztest.h
   file in the Include File dialog box and click OK.

3. Save the file.

The C0000005 error message appears.
Here is an automated example that runs in Visual FoxPro 6.0:

1. Create a program with the following code:

   #define EOL chr(13)
   ***test.prg
   dele file testxx.h
   strtofile([#IFDEF BLA]+EOL+ ;
    [#IF Empty(BLA)]+EOL+ ;
    [#ENDIF]+EOL+ ;
   	[#ENDIF], 'testxx.h')

   dele file tempxx.vc?
   LOCAL aobj[1], xx
   _cliptext = 'testxx.h'
   keyb '{alt+c}i{alt+i}{ctrl+v}{enter}{ctrl+w}'

   CREATE CLASS TEMP1 AS FORM OF TEMPXX

2. Save the file and run it.
