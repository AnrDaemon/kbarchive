TITLE   :XFOR:Messages Blocked from Host to Exchange on OV/VM(PROFS)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Mail sent from the host to Exchange Server by means of the Sendfile command
might result in the OV/VM (PROFS) Connector restarting continuously. This will
result in a mail backlog on the host side.

CAUSE
=====

There are certain key words in the host (VM) environment that should not be
used, for example, the keyword SYSTEM. When you use the keyword SYSTEM as part
of a target Exchange Server mail recipient, the host will strip out the username
(SYSTEM) before sending it to the OV/VM (PROFS) connector, which causes the
OV/VM (PROFS) Connector to go into an endless loop.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: OV/VM (PROFS) Connector

+-------------------------+
| File name  | Version    | 
+-------------------------+
| Lsvmhc.dll | 5.5.2573.0 | 
+-------------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To send a note from the host to Exchange Server, the format is as follows:

   SENDFILE <FILENAME> <FILETYPE> <FILEMODE> <USERID> AT
   <NODEID>

So in this case, taking the file Profile.exec on the A disk, and sending it to
the Exchange(system) address, the command line would be:

   SENDFILE PROFILE EXEC A SYSTEM AT EXCHANGE
