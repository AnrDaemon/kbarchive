SYMPTOMS
========

When a mapping is made to a network drive using the Substitute command, clients
might not be able to copy files from that drive mapping to My Briefcase. The
copy operation fails, but there is no error message.


CAUSE
=====

Symptoms only occur when the Substitute command is used to map a network
resource.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, move or copy the file to a local drive first, and
then copy the file to My Briefcase.

Do not use the Substitute command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Dr. Watson errors have also been observed when using My Briefcase in conjunction
with substitute drives.
