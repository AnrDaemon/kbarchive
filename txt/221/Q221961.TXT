SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install a PostScript printer driver using the Add Printer
Wizard, you may receive the following error message:

   Rundll32.dll caused a general protection fault in Pscript.drv.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the following lines are present in the [Boot] section of
the System.ini file:

Adobe Type Manager is the program that inserts these lines.

system driver. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "sysedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

3. In the [Boot] section of the System.ini file, locate the following lines, and
   then type a semicolon (;) at the beginning of each line:

   system.drv=atmsys.drv
   atmsystem.drv=system.drv

4. In the [Boot] section of the System.ini file, type the following new line:

   "atm.system.drv=system.drv" (without the quotation marks)

5. On the File menu, click Exit. When you are prompted to save current changes,
   click Yes.
