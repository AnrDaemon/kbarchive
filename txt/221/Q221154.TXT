TITLE   :CGI Application Unable to Parse STDIN During Redirection

SYMPTOMS
========

When a CGI application does a redirection and the REQUEST_METHOD is a POST,
information may not be available on STDIN. This can occur when a CGI application
is processing a POST from a client and the CGI application is located on a
computer running Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0. If the CGI
application does a redirection using the full URL path, Microsoft IIS returns an
external redirection to the client the and results are as expected. If under the
same conditions, the CGI application does a redirection using a relative path
URL, information may not be available in STDIN as expected.

When the CGI application uses a relative path, internally IIS processes a
redirect as a GET. This can present a problem for the CGI application. The
information that the CGI application expects on STDIN, is not available. It is
located in the QUERY_STRING variable instead.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the full URL in the CGI application instead of
a relative path when a CGI application does a redirection.
