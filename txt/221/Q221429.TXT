TITLE   :XFOR: Continuous Retry Of Dirsync If Options Tab Not Configured
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise, the Options tab allows
you to configure the Import and Export containers as well as the GroupWise API
Gateway path.

If you configure the Import and Export containers, but not the GroupWise API
Gateway path, the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise attempts
continuous unsuccessful directory synchronization (dirsync) retries.

No error message warns you of this condition during startup of the services
necessary to support the dirsync process. (These services include the Microsoft
Exchange Connectivity Controller, the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell
GroupWise, and the Microsoft Exchange Router for Novell GroupWise.)

WORKAROUND
==========

Configure the API Gateway path correctly before you start the dirsync process.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5.
