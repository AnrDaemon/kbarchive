======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


In Visual FoxPro 5.x and 6.0, dimensioning a two-dimension array greater than its
maximum allows value, which is 32500, causes the following or some other memory
related error message:

   C0000005 Fatal Error

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Cut and paste the program below into a .PRG:

   x1 = CREATEOBJECT( "cBigArray" )
   x1.aBig[1,1] = 1
   x1.aBig[1000,1] = 1
   x1.aBig[10000,1] = 1
   x1.aBig[30000,1] = 1

   DEFINE CLASS cBigArray AS Custom
      DIMENSION aBig[33000,2]
   ENDDEFINE

2. Save and run the .PRG.

   NOTE: Visual FoxPro causes a C0000005 Fatal Error and terminates.

   After the fix in Visual Studio Service Pack 3, Visual FoxPro shows this error
   message when the maximum allowed value is greater then 32500 on a two-
   dimensional array:

   Too Many Variables
