   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When adding a printer for the first time, the user will receive a pop-up message
asking if he or she wants to overwrite existing drivers. The user will get this
message even though the user never had this printer installed before. Even if
the user answers "Yes" to the question, the driver will not install properly.
The driver for the printer will not appear in the Spool\Drivers\W32x86\2 folder
(for x86-based computers).

CAUSE
=====

The problem is that the image that was used to create the system had this
printer installed and entries are in the registry for this printer but the
driver files are not present in the drivers folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before the image is duplicated, use Registry Editor and delete the driver
entries in the registry or be sure the %SystemRoot%\System32\Spool\Drivers
folder is copied as part of the image.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To remove the entries in the registry, delete all entries under the following
registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\Currentcontrolset\Control
   \Print\Environments\Windows NT <platform>\Drivers\Version-<x>

For example, in the case of x86, a user would delete all entries under:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\Currentcontrolset\Control
   \Print\Environments\Windows NT x86\Drivers\Version-2

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
