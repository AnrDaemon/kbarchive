Terminal Server Edition compact disc media:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Depending on what service pack is installed on the computer being debugged, the
service pack symbols needs to be installed/extracted on top of the symbols
extracted from Windows NT 4.0 base compact disc.

Run SpXsymi.exe or SpXsyma.exe from the Support\Debug folder on the service pack
compact disc for Intel or Alpha platforms respectively, where X corresponds to
service pack level; for example, Sp4symi.exe would be SP4 for Intel-based
computers.

You will be prompted to specify the directory for the extracted files.

You can find the symbols files available for download at the following Web site:

   http://support.microsoft.com/highlights/ntw40.asp

NOTE: The inclusion of the Copydbg.cmd file in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 is
intended to pull the new build of some of the debugging modules included in
Service Pack 3 and copy them and their associated symbols to the destination
path included in the following command line.

For example, if your CD-ROM is drive E, your debugging tools are in D:\Mytools,
and your .dbg files are in C:\Winnt\Symbols, type the following line:

   copydbg e: d:\mytools c:\winnt\symbols

Additional query words: symbols debug
