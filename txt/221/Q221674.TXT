 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Certain Chinese characters saved in the Excel 97 worksheet may cause the
following error when imported into a Visual FoxPro 6.0 table using either the
Import Wizard or the Import command:

   Fatal Error: Exception Code:C0000005

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information

MORE INFORMATION
================

Only certain Chinese characters saved in the Excel worksheet will cause this
problem.


Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Excel worksheet and randomly type in a large number of Chinese
   characters.

2. Launch Visual FoxPro 6.0, and type in the following command in Command
   window:

If the offensive characters are in the Excel worksheet, Visual FoxPro 6.0 will
generate a C0000005 Fatal Error and terminate.
