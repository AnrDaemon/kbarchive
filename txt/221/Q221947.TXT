KEYWORDS:kbdocfix kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Systems Management Server 2.0 Administrator's Guide, Chapter 10
Collecting Hardware and Software Inventory, page 339, in the section labeled
Scheduling Software Inventory, it states the following:

   "To force a software inventory on a single client, first click the Systems
   Management Control Panel applet in the Windows Control Panel. On the Agents
   tab, select Software Inventory Client Agent and then click Run."

This information is INCORRECT. The user will note that there is neither an Agents
tab, nor a Run button. The correct way to force a software inventory is:

1. Go to the Systems Management Control Panel applet.

2. Click the Components tab.

3. Highlight the Software Inventory Agent.

4. Click Start Component.
