TITLE   :FIX: DATE() Function Does Not Propagate NULLs Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbXBase kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kbVS600sp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Placing a NULL in the DATE() function causes the following error:

   Function argument, value, type or count is invalid.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

The syntax of the DATE() function is DATE([nYear, nMonth, nDay]). Placing a NULL
in any of the parameters causes the error.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Open the Command window, and type the following:

   "? DATE(null,3,2)" (without the quotation marks)

The error listed in the SYMPTOMS section appears.

Using the NULL in place of the following parameters also causes the error:

   "? DATE(1998,null,2)&& " (without the quotation marks)should return
   January for the month

   "? DATE(1998,3,null)&& " (without the quotation marks)should return
   first day

If NULL appears in place of the year, Visual FoxPro should substitute the current
year or month. If NULL replaces the month, January should be returned for the
month. If NULL replaces the day parameter, it should default to the first day of
the month.
