SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the call command in a Windows NT logon script, you may receive the
following error message on some Windows 95-based computers during the logon
process:

   Bad command or filename

This problem does not occur if you run the call command after you log on, or if
you map a drive to the Netlogon share and run a batch file that uses the call
command.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, you can modify the logon script so that it does
not use the call command. For example, assume that you want to use the following
sample script:

   echo on
   call \\server1\share1\script1.bat

Instead, use the following method:

   echo on
   net use x: \\server1\share1
   x:\script1.bat
   net use x:/d

This script does not use the call command but achieves the same result.
