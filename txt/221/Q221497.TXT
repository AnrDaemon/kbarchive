TITLE   :RRAS: RIP Routing Stops When System Time Is Changed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up a computer running Windows NT 4.0 as a routing information
protocol (RIP) router and the system time is changed backward, RIP updates stop
until the original time is reached again. This may cause the route to be
invalid, and part or all of the network may not work for the time period the RIP
updates are seized.

For example, if it is 2:00 A.M. and the time on the server is changed to 1:50
A.M., RIP updates stop and clients may be unable to gain access to parts of the
network until the server reaches 2:00 A.M. again.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because RIP routing uses absolute system time. When the
time changes unexpectedly, the RIP routing service does not send updates.

RESOLUTION
==========
