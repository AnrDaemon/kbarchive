======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Calling the NVL() function multiple times in Visual FoxPro 5.0 causes the
following error message:

   Property <property name> is not method or event.

If you click the Ignore button in the error dialog box and run the program again,
you normally see the following error:

   An application error has occurred and an application log is being generated.
   VFP.exe
   Exception: access violation (0x0000005), Address: <memory address>

In some instances, the first error message is skipped and the second error is
displayed.

The following error can also occur:

   The instruction at "0x00401e44" referenced memory at "0x010bb018". The memory
   could not be "read".

In Visual FoxPro 6.0, the following error often appears after calling the NVAL()
function the third time:

   Fatal error: Exception code: C0000005

CAUSE
=====

The NVL() function saved the handle, but it released the object reference.

======
