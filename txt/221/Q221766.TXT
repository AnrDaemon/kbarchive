TITLE   :Registry Permissions Not Inherited Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After securing the registry with C2Config, subkeys created in the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes,
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft, and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Secure
keys do not inherit the expected permissions.

CAUSE
=====

C2Config sets the inherited permissions separately from the object permissions.
The permissions to be set are defined in the C2RegACL.inf file, and it does not
include the permissions to be inherited by subkeys.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem you should add the permissions to be inherited to the
C2RegACL.inf file.

Example:

Section of C2RegACL.inf before modifications:

   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE]
   BUILTIN\Administrators = FULL
   CREATOR OWNER =  FULL
   SYSTEM = FULL
   Everyone = QV, SV, CS, ES, NT, DE, RC

Section of C2RegACL.inf after adding inherited permissions:

   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE]
   BUILTIN\Administrators = FULL
   BUILTIN\Administrators = INHERIT, FULL
   CREATOR OWNER =  FULL
   CREATOR OWNER =  INHERIT, FULL
   SYSTEM = FULL
   SYSTEM = INHERIT, FULL
   Everyone = QV, SV, CS, ES, NT, DE, RC
   Everyone = INHERIT, QV, SV, CS, ES, NT, DE, RC

Note the INHERIT entry in the permissions. This is the option that sets the
permissions that will be inherited by subkeys.
