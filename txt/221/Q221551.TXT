TITLE   :XFOR: Fixed Length RFT Attachments Incorrectly Changed by OVVM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Revisable Text Format (RFT) documents that are saved in "Fixed" format will be
unreadable when sent to Exchange Server by means of the OV/VM (PROFS) Connector.

CAUSE
=====

This is because the OV/VM (PROFS) Connector incorrectly assumes that all RFT
documents are in "Variable" format.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: OV/VM (PROFS) Connector

+-------------------------+
| File name  | Version    | 
+-------------------------+
| Lsvmhc.dll | 5.5.2567.0 | 
+-------------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If an RFT document is transferred from a personal computer into CMS and saved
with RECFM of Variable on the CMS minidisk, stored in the OV/VM document
database, and then sent to an Exchange Server mailbox, the document will be
translated correctly. But if the RFT document is saved with RECFM of Fixed, then
the document is unreadable when sent to an Exchange Server mailbox.
