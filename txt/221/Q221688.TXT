KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbOOP kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbXBase kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kbV

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Eval() method of the _VFP system variable cannot accept a string longer than
255 characters.
In Visual FoxPro 6.0, the following error appears:

   OLE exception code 0 from Visual FoxPro for Windows:10 :Syntax error...

In Visual FoxPro 5.0x, this error appears:

   OLE exception code 0 from Visual FoxPro for Windows: Syntax error...

This problem normally occurs when a COM client is calling the EVAL() method on
the Visual FoxPro server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

In the Command window, type the following line of code:

   _vfp.EVAL("MESSAGEBOX('" + REPLICATE("a",242) + "')")

The error mentioned in the Symptoms section appears.

NOTE: The MessageBox() function is 12 characters, two more for the quotes and
then replicating the letter "a" 242 times makes 256 characters within the
_vfp.EVAL() function.
