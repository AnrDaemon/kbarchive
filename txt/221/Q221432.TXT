TITLE   :XFOR: Pickup Folder Mishandles Read-Only File Permissions
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,4.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:MCIS_MSG exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Commercial Internet System version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you generate SMTP mail by creating files, some files are not removed. This
happens when you create files in Request for Comments (RFC) 822 format in the
Pickup subfolder of the Mailroot folder of the Internet Information Server (IIS)
SMTP service (SMTPSVC). Subsequent restarts of the SMTPSVC causes the file to be
reprocessed, but the file still is not removed.

CAUSE
=====

These unremoved files that were copied into the Pickup folder have the Read-Only
attribute set. There is no explicit checking to ascertain whether the files
processed have the Read-Only attribute set or not. Note that this problem does
not occur with the Pickup subfolder of the Imcdata folder when you are using the
Exchange Server 5.5 Internet Mail Service.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you copy files into the Pickup folder, ensure that the Read-Only attribute
is not set.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
