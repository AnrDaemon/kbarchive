TITLE   :SMS: Restrictive WinNT Account Policies Prevent DC Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbClient kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Restrictive Windows NT account policies can prevent domain controllers from
installing the Systems Management Server client. You set account policies in
Windows NT User Manager for Domains by clicking Account on the Policies menu.

If you set the value Minimum Password Age to anything other than Allow Changes
Immediately, domain controllers will fail to install the Systems Management
Server client.

You will see the following error in either the Wn_manual.log or Wn_logon.log
files:

   Could not register CCIM; AppRegister return code =1060
   Waiting for 1 minute for CliSvc to start CCIM
   Generated account name 'SMS&_NTD-MD-01'
   Waiting for PDC/BDC Sync (1327)

   Error 1327 = Logon failure: user account restriction.

NOTE: You may also see the error in the Client Configuration Manager (CCM)
Ccm.log file or in the Systems Management Server Client Service Clisvc.log. To
work around this problem, set the Minimum Password Age property to Allow Changes
Immediately.
