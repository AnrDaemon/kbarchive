-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the German version of Exchange Server version 5.5, the setup
may not work, and the following error message may be displayed:

   Setup cannot update your Windows NT files because the language installed on
   your system is different from the update language.

CAUSE
=====

Documentation on the German Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM contains incorrect links
to a necessary roll-up fix that ensures reliable performance. The incorrect link
on the German Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM is to the English (U.S.A.) version of
the fix. That link is as follows:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postSP3/roll-up

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can obtain the correct fix (German) at the
following Web site:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/ger/nt40/hotfixes-postSP3/roll-up

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
