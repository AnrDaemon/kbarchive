TITLE   :OL\Exch Mac Client Hangs Wrkstn While Attempting to Find Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::8.0,8.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, versions 8.0, 8.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the Outlook for PowerMacintosh, Exchange Server edition client is running
on a Macintosh computer, the system may periodically stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange client (in this case Outlook) initiates a poll for new messages
(this occurs approximately every 70 seconds). The above behavior is caused when
the client is waiting for, and does not receive, a response from the Exchange
Server computer.


STATUS
======

This is a limitation of the Apple, Inc. transport APIs. Microsoft is
cooperatively working with Apple to create a solution to work around these
limitations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Outlook for PowerMacintosh and all other Exchange/Outlook clients use
synchronous calls to communicate with the Exchange server. When the Macintosh
client polls the server for new messages and the net/server is "down" or very
busy, the EcDoRPC call the client initiates will be blocked and "lock" the
operating system. When the net/server is "back on line" or not as busy, the call
will complete and normal operation of the operating system will continue. The
current implementation includes a timeout method, that depends on the Apple Inc,
provided API. Limitations in the API cause the timeout not to work as designed.

Additional query words: Outlook MAC client hangs.
