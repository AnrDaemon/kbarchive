PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kbVS600sp3fix kbGrpDSFox

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing a CLOSE ALL command in the BeforeBuild event of the Project Hook object
causes the following error:

   Mismatched pushjmp/popjmp call

After the error appears, clicking OK in the dialog box causes Visual FoxPro 6.0
to terminate with a C0000005 error or an application error message under Windows
NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a PRG.

2. Cut and paste the code below into the PRG:

   oProject=CREATEOBJECT("myprojecthook")

   STRTOFILE("wait window","main.prg")
   MODIFY PROJECT test NOWAIT

   _VFP.ActiveProject.Files.Add("main.prg")
   _VFP.ActiveProject.ProjectHook=oProject
   _VFP.ActiveProject.Build

   DEFINE CLASS myprojecthook As projecthook

      PROCEDURE BeforeBuild
      LPARAMETERS cOutputName, nBuildAction, lRebuildAll, lShowErrors, lBuildNewGuids
         CLOSE ALL
      ENDPROC

   ENDDEFINE
    

3. Save and run the PRG.

   Note that Visual FoxPro produces a dialog box containing the "Mismatched
   pushjmp/popjmp call" error. When you click OK, Visual FoxPro terminates with
   C0000005 error or an application error message under Windows NT.
