KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbXBase kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kbVS600sp3fix kbGrpDSF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have a form which allows display of a shortcut menu (this type of menu is
usually displayed via right mouse click and may be referred to as a popup or
context menu). If the menu height is greater than the height of the form which
displays it, the menu will be limited in size to the height of the form and
display scroll arrows at its top and/or bottom.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.PRG) file:

   PUBLIC oForm
   oForm = CREATEOBJECT('form1')
   oForm.SHOW()

   * This displays the menu with a rightclick
   MOUSE CLICK AT 5,5 PIXEL WINDOW 'form11' RIGHT

   * This scrolls it to display the scroll arrows
   KEYBOARD '{dnarrow}{dnarrow}{dnarrow}{dnarrow}'
   KEYBOARD '{dnarrow}{dnarrow}{dnarrow}'

   DEFINE CLASS form1 AS FORM
      HEIGHT = 110
      PROC RIGHTCLICK
         DO showmenu
      ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

   PROC showmenu
      * The code in this procedure is similar to code generated
      * by the menu generator
      DEFINE POPUP shortcut SHORTCUT RELATIVE FROM MROW(),MCOL()
      DEFINE BAR 1 OF shortcut PROMPT "one"
      DEFINE BAR 2 OF shortcut PROMPT "two"
      DEFINE BAR 3 OF shortcut PROMPT "three"
      DEFINE BAR 4 OF shortcut PROMPT "four"
      DEFINE BAR 5 OF shortcut PROMPT "five"
      DEFINE BAR 6 OF shortcut PROMPT "six"
      DEFINE BAR 7 OF shortcut PROMPT "seven"
      DEFINE BAR 8 OF shortcut PROMPT "eight"
      DEFINE BAR 9 OF shortcut PROMPT "nine"
      DEFINE BAR 10 OF shortcut PROMPT "ten"
      DEFINE BAR 11 OF shortcut PROMPT "eleven"
      DEFINE BAR 12 OF shortcut PROMPT "twelve"

      ACTIVATE POPUP shortcut
   ENDPROC

2. The menu will appear with arrows at top and bottom of menu. Each arrow will
   be contained in a white box, and will not respond to mouse clicks. You may
   close the menu by pressing escape or clicking outside of it, and redisplay it
   by right-clicking on the form.
