======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running an application that employs repeated calls to the CHRTRAN() function can
result in the following error in Visual FoxPro 6.0:

   Fatal error: Exception code=C0000005
   Called from - <procedure name and line number> {<path and
   filename>}

The procedure name and line number will contain the method or procedure
containing the CHRTRAN() function and its line number. Note that the line number
will be 0 if the executable was built with the Debug Info checkbox in the
Project Information dialog unchecked. The path and filename will contain the
path and filename of the file containing the method or procedure.

Under the same circumstances, Visual FoxPro 5.0 may produce an error similar to
the following under Windows NT:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.

   vfp.exe
   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005),Address 0xnnnnnnnn

Under Windows 9x, Visual FoxPro 5.0 may produce an error similar to the
following:

   VFP caused an invalid page fault in module <module name>
