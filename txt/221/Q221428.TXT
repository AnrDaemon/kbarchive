TITLE   :XFOR: Mail Forwarded from GroupWise to Exchange Loses Flag
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Novell GroupWise user forwards mail that originated in Microsoft Exchange
Server to another Exchange Server user, the Importance and Sensitivity settings
may not be retained. These settings can be found in the Header.txt file that is
attached to the message. This behavior does not occur with messages that
originate in GroupWise.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Novell application programming interface
(API) gateway does not process the importance and sensitivity information
properly.
