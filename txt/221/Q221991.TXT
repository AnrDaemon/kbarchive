SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT starts a screen saver in the local system context and then
immediately changes the context to match that of the logged on user. However,
Windows NT does not verify that this change completed successfully. If the
change fails, the screen saver is running in a privileged state that permits a
specially programmed screen saver to use these privileges to elevate the
security of the logged on user.
