Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Note: This file must be processed by Asp.dll, so it must be browsed as you would
any file in a Web site.

Installing Metainfo.asp
-----------------------

1. Downloaded and run the following file:

   Metainfo.exe
   (http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/Metainfo.exe)

2. When you are prompted for the location to place the extracted files, provide
   a directory in your Web content area that is configured to allow ASP scripts
   to run. Metainfo.asp will be saved here.

3. After Metainfo.exe exits, in Windows NT Explorer, browse to the directory
   where you saved Metainfo.asp, and open the properties for Metainfo.asp. On
   the Security tab, click Permissions and grant yourself and the local
   administrators group full control.

Using Metainfo.asp
------------------

1. To use Metainfo.asp, you must have administrative access to the Web server.

2. Open your Web browser, and browse to
   http://<your_server_name>/<path>/Metainfo.asp. Trying to access
   this file through Windows Explorer (for example, as
   C:\inetpub\wwwroot\Metainfo.asp) will not work. It must be accessed through a
   URL.

3. After a few seconds, the server will return an HTML page that contains your
   configuration information. You can save this page from your browser for
   future reference.

The techniques used by Metainfo.asp are documented in the IIS 4.0 online product
documentation under Microsoft Internet Information Server/Programmers
Reference/IIS administration.
