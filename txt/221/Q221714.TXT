PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInternet kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbFFC kbVS600sp3 kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Target URL combobox in the _Hyperlinklabel Builder does not allow any URL
longer than 34 characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can type in any long URL directly to the cTarget property instead of using
the combobox in the builder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

The Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3 readme erroneously lists this bug as being
fixed. Service Pack 3 did not fix this bug.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Launch Component Gallery.

2. Create a new form.

3. Expand the Foundation Classes folder in Component Gallery and select
   Internet.

4. Drag and drop the Hyperlink label class to the form.

5. In the Hyperlink builder, type in the following URL into the Target URL combo
   box.

   http://msdn.microsoft.com/vfoxpro/technical/articles.asp    
    

In Visual FoxPro 6.0, you are unable to finish typing the entire URL. In Visual
Studio 6.0 SP3 for FoxPro, you can continue typing the long address, but the
data truncates.
