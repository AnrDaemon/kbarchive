KEYWORDS:kbMiscTools kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbVS600sp3fix kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Locals window of the Debugger does not refresh properly when a program
contains either the SUSPEND or the SET STEP ON commands.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open Visual FoxPro and the Debugger. Arrange the windows so that Visual
   FoxPro is on the right half of the screen, and the Debugger is on the left
   half. The screens should not overlap.

2. Create a program called Test containing the following code:

   CLEAR ALL
   DEBUG
   PUBLIC x

   x = PROGRAM()
   DO proc1 WITH x

   PROCEDURE proc1
   LPARAMETERS tx
   LOCAL x
   x = tx+' '+PROGRAM()
   SET STEP ON
   DO proc2 WITH x
   ENDPROC

   PROCEDURE proc2

   LPARAMETERS tx
   LOCAL x
   x = tx +' '+ PROGRAM()
   SET STEP ON
   ?x

3. Leave the Test program open and run the code.

4. Press the Resume [>] toolbar button in the Debugger twice.

5. Press the ALT+TAB keys to go back to Visual FoxPro and run the program again
   by pressing the CTRL+E keys.

Call Stack window correctly says:

Proc1
Test.prg

The Locals dropdown correctly says: Proc1. Value of x in Locals window is TEST;
this is correct value for x in Test, not Proc1, and tx does not appear. If you
move the Visual FoxPro window over the Debugger Locals window to make it
repaint, you will see the correct value for x ("TEST PROC1"), but the letters tx
still do not appear.

6. Press the Resume [>] button in Debugger toolbar.

Observed: Call Stack window correctly says:

Proc2
Proc1
Test.prg

The Locals dropdown correctly says Proc2. Value of x in Locals window is TEST or
TEST PROC1 depending on if you forced a repaint above in observed after step 3.
This is correct value for x in Test or Proc1, and the letters tx still do not
appear.

At any time, if you click a program in the Call Stack window, or click on the
locals dropdown to select a procedure, the Locals Window displays the correct
values.

To see the behavior with the SUSPEND command, follow these steps:

1. Create and run the following code from a program (.PRG) file:

   DEBUG
   x = 1
   SUSPEND
   x = 3

2. Look at the Locals window.

Notice that x is not visible. If you click on the program name in the Call Stack
window, x will appear in the Locals window.
