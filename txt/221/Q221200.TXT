TITLE   :AddPrinter() API Call Allows Invalid Data Type
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP1,4.0 SP2,4.0 SP3,4.0 SP4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the AddPrinter() API call to create printers programmatically,
custom settings that you specify may not be used.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you add a data type that is not valid with other
settings. For example, the EMF and Direct Printing settings are not compatible
with each other. The validity of the API call is not checked by the operating
system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To verify settings that are valid for any data type:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Create a new printer, or right-click a printer and then click Properties.

3. Configure all the settings that you want to program and verify that the
   settings are available for the data type (such as RAW or EMF).

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
