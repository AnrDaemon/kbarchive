The information in this article applies to:

 - ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), versions 1.5, 2.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Access 2.0 
 - Microsoft Access for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Access 97

SUMMARY
=======

When a new record is added to an ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) Recordset that
contains an Autonumber field, immediately reporting the value of the Autonumber
field for the inserted record returns a value of 0.

This article describes how to retrieve the automatically generated value of an
Autonumber field of a record inserted into an Access database with the ADO
AddNew() and Update() methods. The sample uses VBScript in an Active Server
Pages (ASP) page.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code assumes that you have the Adventure Works database on your
machine and you have an ODBC datasource name (DSN) named AdvWorks pointing to
it.

The sample also includes the file Adovbs.inc, which can be found in \Program
Files\Common Files\System\Ado.

This code does not prompt the user for any input. It inserts one record into the
Customers table of the Adventure Works database and displays the value of the
Autonumber field (CustomerID) of the new record.

Following are some key elements to note:

 - The CursorLocation must be adUseClient. Access does not support a server-side
   cursor.

 - In order to populate the Autonumber field with the automatically generated
   value, the recordset must be requeried using the Requery method.

 - The Requery method resets the absolutePosition (bookmark) from the newly
   inserted record, to the first record of the requeried recordset. As a result,
   the absolutePosition must be saved before calling Requery, and restored to
   the newly inserted record after Requery has been called.

   Set objConn = CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
   Set objRS = CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset")

   objConn.Open "DSN=advworks;"

   'Access does not support a cursor engine so a client cursor must be used
   objRS.CursorLocation = adUseClient

   objRS.Open "SELECT * FROM Customers", objConn, adOpenStatic, adLockOptimistic

        ' when you invoke the method AddNew it adds a new record to the end of           
        ' your current recordset and places your cursor on that record.
        
   objRS.AddNew
   	objRS("CompanyName") = "Microsoft"
   	objRS("ContactFirstName") = "Bob"
   	objRS("ContactLastName") = "Smith"
   objRS.Update

        ' when you invoke the method Update, it updates the database with the
        ' values of the new record that we just created.  To retrieve the 
        ' value of the Autonumber field we need to update the ADO recordset that
        ' currently have.

        ' When you do a Requery on your recordset, you lose your cursor.  So
        ' we need to store the location before we do the Requery, then reset
        ' it after the Requery.

   'before the requery, the Autonumber field shows as 0
   Response.Write "<br>ID before Requery = " & objRS("CustomerID")   

   bookmark = objRS.absolutePosition  ' First, store the location of you cursor
   objRS.Requery                      ' Next, update your recordset with the data from the database

   'after the requery, the absolutePosition is the first record of the recordset
   Response.Write "<br>ID before setting absolutePosition = " & objRS("CustomerID")

   objRS.absolutePosition = bookmark  ' Finally, change your cursor back

   'now we have the Autonumber value
   Response.Write "<P>Added ID = " & objRS("CustomerID")

   objRS.Close
   objConn.Close
