   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you configure your computer to use a password-protected screen saver, you
may be able to bypass the password security and unlock the computer (using a key
press or mouse movement) after the screen saver has started.

CAUSE
=====

There is a delay between the time the screen saver locks the computer and the
attendant password protection is established. During this interval, you can use
a key press or mouse movement to unlock the computer without having to type in
the configured password.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this problem, change (reduce) the screen saver password registration
interval in the registry. To do this:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click OK.

2. On the Windows menu, click "HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE on Local Machine".

3. Double-click the \Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
   folder.

4. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, type "ScreenSaverGracePeriod" (without the
   quotation marks), click REG_SZ in the Data Type box, and then click OK.

5. Type a number representing the password activation delay (in number of
   seconds) in the Data box, and then click OK. You can enter any whole number
   between 0 and 2,147,483. The default entry is 5. If you use an entry of zero,
   there is no password protection delay.

6. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.
