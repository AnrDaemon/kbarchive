Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

WARNING: Close all running applications and save your data before following this
procedure.

1. Create a PRG.

2. Cut and paste the following code into the PRG:

   PUBLIC oform1

   oform1=NEWOBJECT("form1")
   oform1.Show
   RETURN

   DEFINE CLASS form1 AS form

      Top = 0
      Left = 0
      Height = 123
      Width = 138
      DoCreate = .T.
      Caption = "Form1"
      Name = "Form1"

      ADD OBJECT combo1 AS combobox WITH ;
         RowSourceType = 1, ;
         RowSource = "one,\two,three,four", ;
         Height = 24, ;
         Left = 0, ;
         Top = 12, ;
         Width = 100, ;
         Name = "Combo1"

   ENDDEFINE
    

3. Save and run the PRG.

4. Click the combobox drop-down list, using the DOWN ARROW key to arrow down the
   list.

5. After highlighting the third item in the combobox drop-down list, use the UP
   ARROW key to arrow up past the disabled item. Note that once the highlighted
   bar moves past the disabled item, Visual FoxPro hangs.
