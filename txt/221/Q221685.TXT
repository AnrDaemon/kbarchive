Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a PRG and type in the code below:

   PUBLIC oform1
   oform1 = CREATEOBJECT('form1')
   oform1.SHOW()

   DEFINE CLASS form1 AS FORM
   	ADD OBJECT pf1 AS PAGEFRAME WITH ;
   		PAGECOUNT = 0
   	PROCEDURE pf1.INIT()
   		THIS.ADDOBJECT('pg1', 'pg')
   	ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS pg AS PAGE
   	PROCEDURE ACTIVATE()
   		NODE
   	ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

2. Save and run the PRG.

Immediately after the PRG runs, the Fatal Error occurs and Visual FoxPro
terminates.
