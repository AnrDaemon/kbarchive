SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send a digitally signed or encrypted e-mail message from
Outlook running on a Microsoft Windows NT-based computer, you may receive the
following error message:

   This message cannot be secured using the selected security settings. Your
   e-mail address may not match the e-mail address on the certificate, or some
   other problem exists with the certificate. Do you want to proceed with this
   message without security?

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if you attempt to use an imported digital ID that
does not match the e-mail address of the mailbox that you currently use.

RESOLUTION
==========

Log on to a mailbox that contains information that is identical to the
information contained in the digital ID key. To view the information that is
contained in the digital ID, click Options on the Tools menu, and then click the
Security tab. In the Security tab, next to Signing Certificate, click Choose,
and then click View Certificate.
