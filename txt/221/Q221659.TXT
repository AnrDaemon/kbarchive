SYMPTOMS
========

After upsizing a database that had primary key indexes in two tables with the
same field and or tag name, the following error occurs:

   Connectivity error: [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]There is
   already an object named 'f1' in the database.

The second Primary Key index "F1" could not be created.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code in a program file:

      #DEFINE DBCNAME 	'testdb'
      #DEFINE TABNAME 	'testtab'
      #DEFINE TABCOUNT   	2

      CLEAR
      CLOSE DATABASES ALL
      DELETE FILE testdb.DBC
      DELETE FILE testdb.dc?

      CREATE DATABASE DBCNAME

      FOR lni = 1 TO TABCOUNT
   	DELETE FILE (TABNAME+ALLTRIM(STR(lni)))+'.dbf'
   	DELETE FILE (TABNAME+ALLTRIM(STR(lni)))+'.cdx'
   	CREATE TABLE (TABNAME+ALLTRIM(STR(lni))) (F1 C(10) NOT NULL ;
   		PRIMARY KEY, F2 C(10) NOT NULL)
      ENDFOR

      ALTER TABLE (TABNAME+ALLTRIM(STR(lni-2))) ADD FOREIGN KEY TAG ;
   	F1 REFERENCES (TABNAME+ALLTRIM(STR(lni-1))) TAG F1

2. Run the SQL Server Upsizing Wizard. Select the database you just created and
   then press the Next button.

3. In the Upsizing Wizard step 2, select an ODBC datasource to a SQL server to
   which you can upsize and then log on to the server.

4. Select both tables in the Upsizing Wizard step 3.

5. In Upsizing Wizard, select Finish and then select Finish again.

6. When upsizing is complete, a project appears. To see the error listed at the
   beginning of this article, preview the report "rpterrs" (this report may be
   named rpterrs1) in the project.
