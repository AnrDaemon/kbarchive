1. Set a breakpoint in the watch window on SET("NULL").

2. Create a program called MyProc.prg with the following code:

   Procedure MyProcedure
      For i = 1 To 100
         Wait Window Str(i) Nowait
      Endfor
   EndProc

3. In the Command window, type "Set Procedure To MyProc." (without the quotation
   marks)

   enter the following code:

   Do MyProcedure
