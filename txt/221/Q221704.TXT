TITLE   :BUG: FFCs - _URLComboBox in _internet.vcx Has Trouble with URLs
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbFFC kbVS600sp3 kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The _urlcombobox foundation class that ships with Visual FoxPro 6.0 facilitates
navigation to various Internet resources. The _urlcombobox adds the prefix
"http://" to any URL that is typed in. Entering a URL other than an http
address, such as an ftp address, results in an invalid URL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

The Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3 readme erroneously lists this bug as being
fixed. Service Pack 3 did not fix this bug.

1. Place the following code in a program and run it:

   ox.Show
   DEFINE CLASS form1 AS form
   	Height = 87

   ENDDEFINE

2. Enter ftp.anyname.com into the URLComboBox.

Notice that http:// has been added to the beginning of the URL.
