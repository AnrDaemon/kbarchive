KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbCtrl kbDatabase kbSQL kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbXBase KbDBFDBC kbVS600sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual FoxPro crashes with a C0000005 error after running a SQL Select statement
that uses the BETWEEN() function. Repeatedly requerying a view that is defined
using the BETWEEN() function might also cause this problem.

This problem can be intermittent and might only happen on certain computers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Copy the following code into a new program file in Visual FoxPro:

   SET STRICTDATE TO 0
   FOR q=1 TO 1000
      WAIT WINDOW TRANS(q) NOWAIT
      SELECT * FROM HOME(2)+"data\orders" ;
      WHERE order_date BETWEEN {07/03/19963} and DATE() ;
      INTO CURSOR junk
   ENDFOR

2. Save and run the program.

3. If the computer is subject to the problem, Visual FoxPro should crash with a
   C0000005 error somewhere between 10 and 20 times through the loop.
