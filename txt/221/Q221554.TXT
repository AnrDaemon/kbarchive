TITLE   :Polish Windows NT Displays Microsoft Sans Serif Font Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0a, 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some Polish characters are displayed incorrectly in dialog boxes in Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 when the Microsoft Sans Serif font is selected.

CAUSE
=====

Most Windows NT localizations assume that the fonts being displayed are
proportional. If the font is not proportional, Windows NT uses kerning pairs
from their English counterparts, and the fonts are not displayed correctly.

The Microsoft Sans Serif font is not a proportional font.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two possible solutions:

 - Delete the Microsoft Sans Serif font and let the font mapper choose one by
   default. This is especially important with Cyrillic localizations (such as
   Russian).

 - Install Visual C++ on Polish Windows NT 4.0. Recompile under the Polish
   localization.
