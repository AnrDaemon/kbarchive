PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbContainer kbCtrl kbOOP kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbVS600sp3fix kbGrpDSFox

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A form's Click event fires when both it and the Click event of individual pages
of a pageframe contain code. The page's Click event should be the only event
that fires.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program that contains the following code:

   frmMyForm = CREATEOBJECT("mytestform")
   frmMyForm.SHOW(1)

   DEFINE CLASS mytestform AS FORM
   	CAPTION= "Click on the Page Tabs"

   	ADD OBJECT pageframe1 AS PAGEFRAME WITH ;
   		PAGECOUNT = 3, ;
   		page1.CAPTION = "Page1", ;
   		Page2.CAPTION = "Page2"

   	PROCEDURE pageframe1.page1.CLICK
   		WAIT WINDOW "Page 1" 
   	ENDPROC

   	PROCEDURE pageframe1.Page2.CLICK
   		WAIT WINDOW "Page 2" 
   	ENDPROC

   	PROCEDURE pageframe1.page3.CLICK
   		WAIT WINDOW "Page 3" 
   	ENDPROC

   	PROCEDURE CLICK
   		WAIT WINDOW "Form Click" NOWAIT
   	ENDPROC

   ENDDEFINE

2. Run the program.

3. Click from tab to tab.

   In Visual FoxPro 6.0, occasionally the form's Click event fires even though
   you click on the pages of the pageframe. In Visual FoxPro 5.0a, the form's
   Click event seems to fire much more often.

   In Visual FoxPro 5.0, if the pageframe resides in a container object, then you
   see similar behavior: the Click event of the container object fires. This
   particular behavior does not seem to occur as often when running a form with
   that configuration in Visual FoxPro 6.0.
