1. Create a program file named Usemem.prg with the following code:

      lnx = ''
      FOR lni = 1 TO 1000
         SET SYSMENU TO DEFA
         IF TYPE('lnx') = 'C'
            lnx = VAL(SYS(1016))
         ENDIF
         lnY= VAL(SYS(1016))
         ?ALLTR(STR(lnY - lnx))
         lnx = lnY
      ENDFOR

2. Run the program file.

3. Observe the output on the screen and note that the User Object Memory
