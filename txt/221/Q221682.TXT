TITLE   :FIX: Expanding/Collapsing Big Array in Watch/Locals Windows Slow
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMiscTools kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbXBase kbVS600sp3fix kbGrpDSFox

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When expanding or collapsing the contents of a large array in either the Locals
or the Watch windows of the Visual FoxPro Debugger, Visual FoxPro 6.0 appears to
hang. Eventually, the contents of the array do appear.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. From the Command window, type the following lines of code:

   SELECT * FROM HOME(2)+'data\orditems' INTO ARRAY atest
   debug

2. Wait a couple of seconds for the array "atest" to appear in the locals
   window. When it does appear, click on the plus sign (+) next to the array
   name to expand it.

   Visual FoxPro 6.0 appears to hang, but the expanded array eventually appears
   in the Locals window after several minutes. After the expanded array appears,
   the same time delay occurs if you try to collapse the array in the Locals
   window. The same behavior occurs with Watch window. The Windows NT Task
   Manager will show Visual FoxPro and the Visual FoxPro Debugger as Not
   Responding while waiting for the array to expand.
