MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a PageFrame class using the following code:

   CREATE CLASS pgfjunk as Pageframe of test

2. Edit the PageFrame and drop several objects (such as textboxes) on the page.

3. Attempt to multiselect the objects by holding down the SHIFT key and then
   clicking on each of the objects on the page.

   Note that you are unable to multiselect with the SHIFT key and mouse click.
   However, clicking and holding the mouse button on the page and then drawing
   an outline across all objects selects all of them.
