-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer (Programming) version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic 6.0 may be used safely with Internet Explorer 5.0 with one
exception, which is detailed as below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The main issue is that Internet Explorer 5 separates the typelib into a separate
.tlb (Mshtml.tlb) file to reduce the memory footprint. This has the following
impact:

 - Developers who develop using Internet Explorer 5 can only distribute Page
   Designer applications to systems where Internet Explorer 5 is installed.

 - Developers who develop using Internet Explorer 4 can distribute Page Designer
   applications to systems where either Internet Explorer 4 or Internet Explorer
   5 are installed.

Thus, when distributing an Internet Explorer 5 Page Designer Application using
the Package and Deployment Wizard, you will receive a warning message stating
that "there is no dependency information for Mshtml.tlb." This warning can
safely be ignored and Mshtml.tlb can be removed from your distribution package.
The application will work properly on a system with Internet Explorer 5
installed.
