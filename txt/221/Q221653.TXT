PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbservicepack kbDatabase kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbXBase kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following program error is encountered with the APPEND FROM <filename>
TYPE CSV command:

   File <path and file name> does not exist

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro was not looking for the CSV file name extension when it was not
provided. For instance, if using an Excel file, issuing the command below would
not produce a program error when the file is named Temp.xls:

   APPEND FROM temp TYPE XLS

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Copy the following code to a new program file:

   CREATE CURSOR x (f1 c(1))
   INSERT INTO x VALUES ('x')
   COPY TO Temp TYPE CSV
   APPEND FROM Temp TYPE CSV

2. Save the program and then run it. The program error should be received on the
   APPEND FROM line.

   NOTE: If there is a file named Temp.txt in the same location as Temp.csv,
   Visual FoxPro will append in Temp.csv without the program error. To repeat,
   if Temp.txt exists, then Temp.csv rather than Temp.txt, will append in
   without error. If you delete Temp.txt, the error will occur.
