The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0

Placing the GetPem() function in a loop while tracing the code more than once in
the Debugger causes the following error in Visual FoxPro 6.0:

Note that the error message also contains information regarding the line number
of the program running when the error occurred.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program called Ztest.prg that contains the following code:

   DO doit
   CLEAR ALL
   DO doit

   PROC doit
   	SET EXACT ON
   	oForm = CREATEOBJECT( "Form" )
   	oForm.ADDOBJECT("lbl1", "label")
   	FOR EACH loObject IN oForm.OBJECTS
   		m = AMEMBERS( laMembers, loObject )
   		lcClass = loObject.CLASS
   		FOR j = 1 TO m
   		IF ( ! pemstatus( loObject, laMembers[j], 1 ) )
   		luClassValue = getpem( lcClass, laMembers[j] )
   			ENDIF
   		ENDFOR
   	ENDFOR
   ENDPROC

2. Close and save the program.

3. Open the Debugger and open the Ztest.prg file.

4. In the Debugger, click the Resume toolbar button.

The C0000005 error appears.
You can also get this error by simply running the code in the example above. In
Visual FoxPro 6.0, if you run the program using either the DO command or by
pressing the Run button (!) on the standard toolbar with the program open, the
C0000005 error appears. In Visual FoxPro 6.0 Service Pack 3, only the DO command
causes the error.
