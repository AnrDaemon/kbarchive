The linker searches for unresolved externals in the following order:
 

1. Find all modules in the library that define current unresolved externals.

2. Process those modules (you may pickup more unresolved externals). The linker
   keeps making passes through that library until no new unresolved externals
   are picked up.

3. It then advances to the next library.

In a similar manner, the linker makes a pass through the entire set of
libraries. After the last library is searched, if new unresolved
externals have been picked up, it returns to the first library and
makes another pass.

Problems can be avoided if you do not use bidirectional cross-library
references (that is, avoid library A calling something in library B
that calls something else in library A). Try to make each library as
self-contained as possible.
