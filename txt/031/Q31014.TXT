========

When you install Microsoft Windows on a Kaypro 16-2 portable computer with a
built-in 9-inch monochrome screen, there appears to be no choice in the Windows
setup for that screen type.

The Kaypro 16-2 portable runs with Windows if you choose the CGA selection for
the screen when running setup. Although it is monochrome, the screen emulates
CGA.
