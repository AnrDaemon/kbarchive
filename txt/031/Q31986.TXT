The Microsoft LINK utility can process no more than 32 libraries
simultaneously. In other words, the linker library field can include up to
32 libraries.

If an application requires more than 32 libraries, perform one of the
following two steps:

 - Use the LIB utility to combine libraries

 - Extract all of the necessary object modules from the libraries using the LIB
   utility and link with them.
