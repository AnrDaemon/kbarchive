TITLE   :XFOR: SMTP Protocol Log Not Created When Minimally Logging
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Enabling Minimum Logging level on the Internet Mail Connector for SMTP Protocol
Log does not create an L0000000.LOG and an Event ID of 2004 is never written to
the Application event log.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the Logging level to Medium or higher will generate an SMTP Protocol log
and generate Event ID 2004.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 578, Chapter 17 of the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide
incorrectly states the following regarding Minimum logging: Logging SMTP
Information

SMTP events are generated by the connections of an Internet Mail Connector. When
you increase the diagnostics logging level for the SMTP Protocol Log category,
Microsoft Exchange Server writes these events to text files. Each concurrent
connection logs its events to a separate file. You can find these files in
\EXCHSRVR\IMCDATA\LOG.

TIP: A quick way to tell if SMTP logging is enabled is to check the Windows NT
application event log when the Internet Mail Connector is started. If enabled,
event 2004 is written to the event log. To locate this event in the Event
Viewer, search the application event log for ID, or the source, MSExchangeIMC,
and the category, SMTP Protocol Log, of the event.

The headers and body of outgoing messages cannot be logged. However, the entire
text of incoming messages is included.

1. Select the Diagnostics Logging tab.

2. Select SMTP Protocol Log.

3. Select a logging level.

4. Restart the Internet Mail Connector.

   Option        Description

   None    (0)  No text logs are created. This is the default.
   Minimum (1)  Connection information is written to the SMTP log.
   Medium  (3)  SMTP commands and headers are written to the SMTP log.
   Maximum (5)  Complete, unformatted protocol packets are written to the
   SMTP log.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
