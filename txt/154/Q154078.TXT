SUMMARY
=======

The Visual Basic Printer object allows for printing through printer drivers, but
there may be times when it is desirable to use the Win32 API to send information
more directly to the printer. The code sample to follow shows how to achieve
this by using API functions that bypass printer drivers to communicate directly
with the print spooler.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place a Command Button on the form.

3. Add the following code to the Form1 code window:

         Option Explicit

         Private Type DOCINFO
             pDocName As String
             pOutputFile As String
             pDatatype As String
         End Type

         Private Declare Function ClosePrinter Lib "winspool.drv" (ByVal _
            hPrinter As Long) As Long
         Private Declare Function EndDocPrinter Lib "winspool.drv" (ByVal _
            hPrinter As Long) As Long
         Private Declare Function EndPagePrinter Lib "winspool.drv" (ByVal _
            hPrinter As Long) As Long
         Private Declare Function OpenPrinter Lib "winspool.drv" Alias _
            "OpenPrinterA" (ByVal pPrinterName As String, phPrinter As Long, _
             ByVal pDefault As Long) As Long
         Private Declare Function StartDocPrinter Lib "winspool.drv" Alias _
            "StartDocPrinterA" (ByVal hPrinter As Long, ByVal Level As Long, _
            pDocInfo As DOCINFO) As Long
         Private Declare Function StartPagePrinter Lib "winspool.drv" (ByVal _
            hPrinter As Long) As Long
         Private Declare Function WritePrinter Lib "winspool.drv" (ByVal _
            hPrinter As Long, pBuf As Any, ByVal cdBuf As Long,  _
            pcWritten As Long) As Long

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
             Dim lhPrinter As Long
             Dim lReturn As Long
             Dim lpcWritten As Long
             Dim lDoc As Long
             Dim sWrittenData As String
             Dim MyDocInfo As DOCINFO
             lReturn = OpenPrinter(Printer.DeviceName, lhPrinter, 0)
             If lReturn = 0 Then
                 MsgBox "The Printer Name you typed wasn't recognized."
                 Exit Sub
             End If
             MyDocInfo.pDocName = "AAAAAA"
             MyDocInfo.pOutputFile = vbNullString
             MyDocInfo.pDatatype = vbNullString
             lDoc = StartDocPrinter(lhPrinter, 1, MyDocInfo)
             Call StartPagePrinter(lhPrinter)
             sWrittenData = "How's that for Magic !!!!" & vbFormFeed
             lReturn = WritePrinter(lhPrinter, ByVal sWrittenData, _
                Len(sWrittenData), lpcWritten)
             lReturn = EndPagePrinter(lhPrinter)
             lReturn = EndDocPrinter(lhPrinter)
             lReturn = ClosePrinter(lhPrinter)
         End Sub
