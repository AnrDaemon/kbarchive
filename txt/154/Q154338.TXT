TITLE   :Documentation for TCP/IP Shows Incorrect Print Destination
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In the "TCP/IP for Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51" manual, an
incorrect print destination is displayed. On page 186, the steps are listed to
create a TCP/IP printer. The steps show and state the choice as being LPRMonitor
while the correct choice is LPR Port. There is no option for LPRMonitor in the
dialog boxes of the actual setup for a TCP/IP printer, only LPR Port.

The "System Guide for Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51" also
incorrectly references LPRMonitor on page 197.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is a documentation error. LPRMonitor should be LPR Port. Select LPR Port in
all instances where the documentation refers to LPRMonitor.
