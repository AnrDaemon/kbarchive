======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you are trying to change your
password on a File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) Server:

   Unexpected Error (89F8)

SUMMARY
=======

To change passwords in a master domain scenario, (Gateway Services for NetWare
(GSNW) must be installed on the primary domain controller (PDC) of the master
domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To make password changes in the Master Domain-Resource Domain scenario, the
client has to be able to directly contact the PDC of the Master Domain. The
client uses RPC to do this. The client queries the server it is logged on to for
the Net Address of the FPNW PDC. If the Server is not advertising itself by
means of Service Advertising Protocols (SAPs), the server the client is logged
on to will not be able to return an address to the client. Without GSNW
installed on the PDC the server will not advertise the RPC service needed for
the client to connect. For this reason GSNW must be installed on the PDC of the
Master Domain so that the other computers in the Domain will be able to forward
his address to the clients. GSNW is not required on any of the other computers
in the domain, but you will not be able to browse NetWare servers if it is not
installed.

STATUS
======

This has been corrected in Windows NT 4.0. FPNW will advertise the RPC service
itself.
