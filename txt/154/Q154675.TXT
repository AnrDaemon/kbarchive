SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to edit or delete an article (page) submitted to a
FrontPage discussion Web in FrontPage Explorer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To delete or edit an article in a FrontPage discussion Web, use the appropriate
method for your version of FrontPage.

FrontPage 97 and 1.1
--------------------

1. In FrontPage Explorer, open the Web.

2. On the Tools menu, click Web Settings, and then click the Advanced tab.

3. Under Options, click to select the "Show documents in hidden directories"
   check box.

4. Click Apply, click Yes, and then click OK.

5. On the View menu, click Folder. Expand the Discussion Web Table Of Contents.

6. Select the article you want to edit or delete.

   The links to the individual articles are represented as links from the
   Tocproto.htm page. The address (URL) of each discussion group article ends
   with an eight-digit integer (these addresses are created in sequential
   order).

    - To edit the article, open it and make the changes you want.

    - To delete the article, open it and delete all the text in the article, or
      replace it with a message like Content Removed by Moderator.

      NOTE: Do not delete the article. Doing so can result in orphaned discussion
      articles.

7. Save the file without changing the URL.

8. On the Tools Menu, click Recalculate Hyperlinks.

9. On the View menu, click Refresh.

FrontPage 1.0 for Windows
-------------------------

NOTE: In FrontPage 1.0, if you delete a page in the middle of a threaded
FrontPage Web, the "previous" and "next" links on the navigation bar break.
Therefore, Microsoft recommends that you edit the page rather than delete the
page. In FrontPage versions 1.1 and later, "previous" and "next" links are
unaffected when you delete articles from the middle of the thread.

1. Open the Web in FrontPage Explorer.

2. On the Tools menu, click Web Settings, and then click the Parameters tab.

3. Click Add, and then type "vti_showhiddenpages" (without the quotation marks).
   Leave the Value field blank. Click OK.

4. Refresh the FrontPage Web by clicking Refresh on the View menu.

5. On the View menu, click Folder. Locate the Tocproto.htm page.

6. On the View menu, click Outline to see the links from the Tocproto.htm file.

7. Find the article that you want to edit or delete.

   The address (URL) of each discussion group article ends with an eight-digit
   integer (these addresses are created in sequential order).

    - To edit the article, open it in FrontPage Editor and make the changes you
      want. Save the file without changing the URL.

      NOTE: DO NOT open the Tocproto.htm file in a program OTHER than FrontPage
      Editor. Doing so will break links to that file.

    - To delete the article, open it in FrontPage Editor and delete all the text
      in the article, or replace it with a message like Content Removed by
      Moderator.

      NOTE: Do not delete the article. Doing so can result in orphaned discussion
      articles.

8. Save the file without changing the URL.
