SUMMARY
=======

Under the Domain Name System (DNS) Manager for Windows NT 4.0, there is no way
to reset the statistics without stopping and restarting the DNS Server service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit includes a tool (DNSSTAT) that will accomplish a
reset of the statistics without stopping the DNS Server service.

This command-line utility provides a dump of DNS server statistics (queries and
responses, database size, caching, memory consumption) on a computer running
Microsoft DNS Server.

   dnsstat {servername | IP address} [{-c | /c | -clear | /clear}]

Where servername gives a dump of all DNS server statistics on the server named
servername.

IP address gives a dump of all DNS server statistics on the server with the IP
address indicated.

-c or /c or -clear or /clear will reset clearable DNS statistics on the server
indicated.
