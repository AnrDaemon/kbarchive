TITLE   :XFOR: cc:Mail Migration Wizard Adds Quotes in User.pri
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you migrate from cc:Mail using the Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard,
messages addressed to users using a cc:Mail Template will not be migrated
successfully. The Migration Wizard will attempt to resolve this template address
and add unwanted quotes in the User.pri file.

In the event log, it will generate the following error:

   Event ID: 27 Source: MSExchangeMig
   Description: Parser Error 00000001.PRI line Number = XX. Characters found
   after end doublequote. Details: Check the number of double quotes in the
   line.

CAUSE
=====

If a cc:Mail address consists of a name and a postoffice, and the name does not
contain any quotable characters but the postoffice does, the opening quote will
be inserted at the start of the whole address list rather than the start of the
affected address.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
