SUMMARY
=======

Under Windows NT Server 4.0, WINS has changed its default configuration values
from those defined under Windows NT 3.51.

The default values for Windows NT Server 3.51 were changed in Windows NT Server
4.0 to the following:

   Renewal Interval = 96 Hours to 144 Hours
   ExtinctionInterval = 96 Hours to 144 Hours
   ExtinctionTimeout = 96 Hours to 144 Hours

These values were changed to allow WINS to handle larger configurations of
computers, as well as cut down on network traffic.
