TITLE   :Computer Hangs with Mitsumi CD-ROM Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are accessing the Mitsumi CD-ROM drive in your computer, the screen may
go blank and the computer may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the controller card for the CD-ROM drive is
configured to use an I/O address, an IRQ line, and possibly a DMA channel.
Windows NT 4.0 uses only the I/O address of the CD-ROM controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable the IRQ line (and DMA channel, if applicable) on the controller. Refer
to the documentation included with your CD-ROM drive for instructions on
changing the settings on the controller.
