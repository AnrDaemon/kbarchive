TITLE   :XADM: Service Packs Fail to Install All Files with -d Option

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you expand files for Microsoft Exchange Service Packs using the PKUNZIP -d
option, some of the files and/or directories are missing.

CAUSE
=====

It appears that PKUNZIP has a limitation of seven directory levels. For example
the SP2_400I.EXE file, when expanded, is four levels deep. If you start
expanding this file in a directory that is greater than three levels deep, it
will fail to expand any files that are in a directory that is eight levels deep,
and it will fail to create directories at the ninth level.


WORKAROUND
==========

There are two solutions to this issue:

 - Make sure you do not decompress the Service Pack 2 files in a directory that
   is deeper than 3 levels.

   -OR-

 - 
   1. Use the MS-DOS Substitute command to map a drive to the directory
      structure. For example: SUBST E: C:\SERVIC~1\EXCHAN~1\SERVIC~1\Server

   2. Decompress the SP2 files from drive E.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The level of directory that this problem will encounter will vary depending on
the length the directory path. If using the substitute command, remember this is
an MS-DOS command, and it does not support long file names.
