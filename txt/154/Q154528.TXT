=======

The screen saver used at the logon screen before pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE is the
Logon Screen Saver. If you want to disable or change the screen saver used, you
must do so through the registry editor.

WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of the Registry Editor
can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Regedt32.exe

2. Go to the following registry location:

     HKEY_USERS\Default\Control Panel\Desktop

   To disable the screen saver:

      Change the Value of Scrnsave.exe to(None)
         Example: (Scrnsave.exe:REG_SZ:(None))
      Change the value of ScreenSaveActive to Zero
         Example: (ScreenSaveActive:REG_SZ:0)

   To Change the default screen saver used:

      Change the Value to the screen saver file (*.scr).
         Example: (Scrnsave.exe:REG_SZ:Logon.scr)
      Change the value of ScreenSaveActive to 1
         Example: (ScreenSaveActive:REG_SZ:1)
