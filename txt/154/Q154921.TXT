TITLE   :Telnet Icon Missing from Accessories Menu
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you add the TCP/IP protocol to your Windows NT 4.0-based workstation under
one user logon ID, the Telnet icon does not appear on the Accessories menu when
another user logs on to the workstation.

CAUSE
=====

The configuration of the Accessories menu is specific to each user. If the
TCP/IP protocol is installed by one user, the Telnet icon is added to the
Accessories menu only for that user.

RESOLUTION
==========

To make the Telnet icon and other icons available to all users of the
workstation, add the icons to a common folder. You can move the Telnet icon to
the common folder, or create a new shortcut for Telnet in the common folder. For
information about creating a common folder, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
