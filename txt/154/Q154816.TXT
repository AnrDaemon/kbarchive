SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to determine whether the MatchEntry property of the
DBCombo is read-only. When setting the MatchEntry property of a DBCombo control
to "1 - Extended Matching"(at run time or design time), Visual Basic may report
that the "Property is read-only."

MORE INFORMATION
================

Extended Matching may be used only when the DBCombo control has the Style
property set to "2 - Dropdown List." This restriction is not documented.

Additionally, there is a bug in the Custom Properties dialog of the 32-bit
DBCombo control. The Custom Properties dialog reports "Property is read only" if
both the style is changed to "2 - Dropdown List," the MatchEntry property is
changed to "1 - Extended Matching," and then the changes are applied. This error
is not reported if the style is changed and applied first followed by changing
and applying the MatchEntry property.
