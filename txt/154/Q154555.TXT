SUMMARY
=======

1. The Domain names at which records are LOCATED (hostname for A, alias for
   CNAME, domain for SOA or NS, and so forth) must always be entered by creating
   the domains and entering a single part non-dotted DNS name.

   This policy is to avoid confusion when someone enters a dotted, non- Fully
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). Locate the domain in the tree and enter the
   name.

2. Domain names which are DATA in a record (NS nameserver, CNAME cannonical
   name, SOA primary name server and responsible party, MX mail server, and so
   forth) are always FQDNs.

   This is because these fields are not necessarily in the domain at all. This
   convention makes it simple; any domain name you type as RR data is considered
   an FQDN.
