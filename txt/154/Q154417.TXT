SUMMARY
=======

When you load a Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer 4.0 (EFD) form
project into Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0, the paneling used for the form will not
be centered on the form and some controls might not be visible.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design. The form panels and controls are not positioned at
design time.

EFD uses an algorithm found in the ArrangeWindow subroutine. This routine is used
to position the main canvas panel, other support panels and controls, and to
determine whether scrollbars are needed on the form window. The sizing and
positioning of the form's main panel and other components are all done at
runtime.
