TITLE   :World Atlas 96: Text in Cosmo's Dialog Box Is Corrupt or Missing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbmm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 96 World Atlas for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Encarta World Atlas, the displayed text in Cosmo's dialog box is
missing or replaced by symbols.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Msgeonr1.ttf (Arial Narrow Special G1) font is
improperly registered during Encarta World Atlas installation.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do the following:

1. Close Encarta World Atlas.

2. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click the Fonts Control Panel.

4. Select the True Type fonts with a date of 7-11-95 or earlier, as well as all
   Arial fonts (including Msgeonr1.ttf), and drag them to the Windows 95
   Desktop. To select multiple fonts, press and hold down the CONTROL keyboard
   key while you select the font with your mouse.

5. After you have moved the fonts to the desktop, move the Msgeonr1.ttf font
   into the Fonts Control Panel. This registers Msgeonr1.ttf as the first font
   in the Arial family.

6. Move all of the remaining fonts on the desktop back into the Fonts Control
   Panel.

For more information about how to accomplish these tasks in Windows, see your
Windows printed documentation or online Help.
