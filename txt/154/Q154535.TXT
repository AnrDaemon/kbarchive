TITLE   :Multiple Instances of Network Interface in Performance Monitor

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the TCP/IP protocol is installed on a Windows NT system, you have the
option in Performance Monitor to select the "Network Interface" object with
multiple instances listed in the "Instance" section. This article explains what
these multiple instances are.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Network Interface object is specific to IP. The instances in the Network
Interface counter refer to the loopback address (127.0.0.1), the network card
(if any), the dial-out WAN wrapper for each device bound under RAS, and the
dial-in WAN wrapper for each device bound under RAS. The instances will always
list the loopback address 127.0.0.1 first and the remaining instances should
match the binding order of the TCP/IP protocol. To view the binding order for
TCP/IP, choose Control Panel Network and click the Bindings button. In the Show
Bindings For list, select TCP/IP Protocol.

NOTE: If RAS does not use IP for a device, it is not counted.

For example: If you have IP running on a network card, an ISDN card (dial-
in/dial-out), and one communications port (dial-out only), but you also have
another communications port set to dial-in/dial-out but using only NetBEUI, you
would have the following instances:

   Instance 1: Loopback adapter (127.0.0.1)
   Instance 2: Network card
   Instance 3: ISDN dial out
   Instance 4: ISDN dial in
   Instance 5: Modem dial out
