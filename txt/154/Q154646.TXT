TITLE   :Setup Stops with Blank Screen During Final Boot

PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbsetup kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setup may halt after the GUI-based portion of Setup is finished and you are
prompted to restart the computer. During the restart, the screen may go blank
with the cursor in the upper left corner of the screen. When this occurs,
pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE may not work to restart the computer. You may have to
turn the computer off and on to restart it.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the computer has an older or outdated BIOS.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade the computer's BIOS to the latest version.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The computer's BIOS (Basic Input Output System) controls the basic hard- ware
devices on the computer. This includes, but is not limited to, memory (RAM),
floppy disk drives, IDE hard disk drives, internal and external caches, and
other miscellaneous functions. Because Windows NT interacts closely with the
hardware on the computer, it is important to have the latest version of the BIOS
for your computer.

In many cases, the BIOS can be upgraded with a program that initializes the BIOS
EPROM and replaces the firmware with the latest version. This is called a "Flash
BIOS" upgrade. Flash BIOS upgrades can be downloaded from the computer or
motherboard manufacturer's Web site or BBS in many cases. However, some computer
manufacturers may require that the motherboard be replaced entirely to upgrade
the BIOS.

Please refer to the manufacturer of your computer or motherboard for information
about the latest BIOS version and upgrade options.
