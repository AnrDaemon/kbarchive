TITLE   :MS-DOS-based Applications May Not Find All Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a 16-bit MS-DOS-based application uses FindFirst or FindNext requests to
search for files, the results may not be complete. This may cause the
application to not operate properly.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM) subsystem does not properly handle
the scenario where a returned value from a function indicates the buffer that
was passed to it was too small to hold all of the data.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT version
4.0. For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base.
