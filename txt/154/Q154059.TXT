The information in this article applies to:

 - The Program Maintenance Utility (NMAKE.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.52, 1.52b, 1.52c 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0, 4.1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When running on Windows 95, commands in the makefile echo out to the screen but
they do not execute. For example, the sample makefile shown below echoes the
following commands:

   dir *.*
   md test

but neither command is executed.

CAUSE
=====

The directory in which you are running nmake is over 66 characters long. When
running in MS-DOS mode on Windows 95, the MS-DOS limitation of 66 characters,
including the drive and colon, still applies. Long filenames are counted as 8
characters when determining the total length of a directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you need to run NMAKE from the Command prompt, the fully qualified directory
length cannot exceed 66 characters.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
