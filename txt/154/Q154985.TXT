TITLE   :DNS Registry Key Not Updated When Changing Zone Type
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a secondary zone and then change that zone to primary, the
registry is not updated to reflect the change. The next time you restart the DNS
server, you receive an error message stating that the primary DNS address is
missing. In this instance the DNS server does not start. Also, the Cache.dns
file may be overwritten with a blank file, causing you to lose name resolution
outside your zone of authority.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT version
4.0. For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
