SYMPTOMS

When you attempt to play the Flyby movie from The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright,

   Your program is making an invalid dynamic link call to a .dll file.

When you click OK, the program closes.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: These steps involve finding, copying, and deleting files and folders. For
more information about how to accomplish these tasks in Windows, see your
Windows printed documentation or online Help.

To resolve this problem, do the following:

1. Find, and then rename the following files, if they exist, in the
   \Windows\System folder on your hard drive:

      Qtim.dll
      Qtimcmgr.dll

2. Copy the following files from the Pre\Flyby folder on the Frank Lloyd Wright
   compact disc into the \Windows\System folder on your hard drive:

      Qtim.dll
      Qtimcmgr.dll

3. Shut down Windows and restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright ships with the run-time version of QuickTime
1.9. If QuickTime version 2.0 is installed on your machine, a conflict occurs
with QuickTime 1.9. Copying the files listed above to the hard drive ensures
that the routines unique to QuickTime 1.9 are defined when Frank Lloyd Wright
loads.
