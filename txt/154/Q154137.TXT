You can use the Personal Address Book as a Mail Merge data source in Word 7.0.

Method 1: View or print the entire PAB
--------------------------------------

1. Start a new Word document. On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge.

2. Click Create and then click Form Letters.

3. Click Active Window.

4. Click Get Data, and then click Use Address Book.

5. In the Use Address Book dialog box, click Personal Address Book, and then
   click OK.

   If the Choose Profile dialog box appears, select your profile, and then click
   OK.

6. In the message box that instructs you to click Edit Main Document to insert
   merge fields, click Cancel.

7. In the Mail Merge Helper, under Data Source, click Edit, and then click Data:
   Personal Address Book.

8. In the Data Form dialog box, click View Source.

   The data source opens in a Word document. The information from your PAB file
   is stored in a Word table. Some of the columns may not be visible and the
   text may wrap oddly.

9. Select the entire table. With the insertion point in a table cell, click
   Select Table on the Table menu.

11. Start Microsoft Excel.

13. Select the entire worksheet. On the Format menu, point to Column, and then
   click AutoFit Selection.

   The columns expand making it easier to read the text.

14. To print the worksheet, click Print on the File menu.

Method 2: View or print selected fields and/or records in the PAB:
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Start a new Word document. On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge.

2. Click Create and then click Catalog.

3. Click Active Window.

4. Click Get Data, and then click Use Address Book.

5. In the Use Address Book dialog box, click Personal Address Book, and then
   click OK.

   If the Choose Profile dialog box appears, select your profile, and then click
