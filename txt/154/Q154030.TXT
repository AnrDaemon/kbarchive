SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure the Attachmate Advanced Twinax adapter
for use with SNA Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Attachmate Advanced Twinax Adapter needs to be configured as an IBM Twinax
adapter because it is register compatible with the IBM 5250 Enhanced Emulation
Adapter. SNA Server needs to be configured to use the IBM Twinax Link Service
when the Attachmate Advanced Twinax Adapter is used. SNA Server's IBM Twinax
Link Service requires that the following parameters match those that are
configured on the Twinax adapter:

 - Interrupt

 - I/O Address

 - Page Address

The IBM Twinax Link Service supports I/O addresses of 2xxA, where xx is a value
from 40 to 7F. The Attachmate Advanced Twinax Adapter has valid I/O addresses
that range from 2418-241F to 27F8-27FF. The valid I/O addresses for the
Attachmate Twinax adapter do not appear to match the valid I/O addresses for the
IBM Twinax Link Service because they do not end with a hexadecimal 'A', so it is
not apparent how to configure the I/O addresses.

When you configure the IBM Twinax Link Service for use with the Attachmate Twinax
adapter, select an I/O Address that matches the first three hexadecimal values
of the I/O Address configured on the Twinax adapter. For example, select an I/O
address of x'241A' in the IBM Twinax Link Service configuration if the
Attachmate Twinax adapter is configured to use an I/O address range of x'2418' -
x'241F'.
