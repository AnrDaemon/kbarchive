PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To successfully upgrade the client files from Windows for Workgroups to Windows
95, use the appropriate Package Definition Files (PDF) when you attempt to send
a upgrade package.

If you perform a non-PDF upgrade, run UPGRADE.BAT or change your logon script to
call UPGRADE.BAT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PDF shipped with Systems Management Server 1.1 and 1.2 allows you to
properly upgrade the operating systems by changing the "OS=" line in the SMS.INI
file and the client files in the \MS\SMS directory. If you do not use the PDF,
the client files are not upgraded and the following error message appears:

   A different OS was detected than that under which Systems Management Server
   was installed.

However, if you run UPGRADE.BAT, your SMS client files will be successfully
upgraded.
