MORE INFORMATION
================

To add a common folder to the Programs menu, follow these steps:

1. Log on to Windows NT with administrative privileges.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the Start button, and then click Open All
   Users on the menu that appears.

3. Create a new folder in the Programs folder.

4. Add shortcuts that you want to be accessible to all users to the new folder.

menu. Administrators can use this method to create shortcuts in one place that
appear on the Programs menu for all users.
