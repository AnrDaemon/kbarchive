 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There is a property in Visual FoxPro 5.0 and 6.0 called ColorSource. The
ColorSource property determines how a control's colors are set and is available
at both design time and run time. Most objects in Visual FoxPro 5.0 and 6.0 have
a ColorSource property, but the available values for the property are different
for each object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The values that are available for the ColorSource property are:

   0 - Object[ASCII 146]s Color Properties. The control uses its color property
           settings (ForeColor, BackColor, and so on).

   1 - Form[ASCII 146]s Color Scheme. The control uses the color scheme of the form
           in which it is placed.

   2 - ColorScheme Property Scheme. The control uses the color scheme
           specified in its ColorScheme property.

   3 - Default Scheme. The control uses its default color scheme. For most
           controls, the default color scheme is the form[ASCII 146]s color scheme;
           forEditBoxes and ListBoxes, the default color scheme is Scheme
           2, User Menus.

  4 - Windows Control Panel (3D Colors) (Default). The control uses the
         3D color settings specified in the Windows Control Panel.

   5 - Windows Control Panel (Windows Colors). The control uses the color
           settings specified in the Windows Control Panel.

The following Visual Fox Pro 5.0 and 6.0 controls have the listed ControlSource
values:
