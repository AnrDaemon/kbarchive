TITLE   :XFOR: IMC Ignores RAS Prefix and Suffix
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) is used to make a
scheduled dial-up RAS connection, it might ignore all prefix and suffix options
defined for the specified Phone Book Entry in the RAS Phone Book. If the prefix
or suffix is required to make a successful connection, the attempt to make a RAS
connection can fail.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, manually enter any required prefix or suffix on the
Phone Number line in the Add Phone Book Entry or Edit Phone Book Entry dialog
boxes. These dialog boxes can be accessed by choosing the Add or Edit buttons in
the Remote Access application. You might also need to remove any global
prefix/suffix settings from the Phone Number Settings dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install Service Pack 2 for Microsoft Exchange, version 4.0, a new
Dial-up Connections tab is added to The Internet Mail Connector Properties page.
This tab provides the ability to make scheduled RAS connections.
