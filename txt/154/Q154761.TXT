SUMMARY
=======

This article contains instructions for recovering from the failure of the
primary domain controller (PDC) and for recovering from a loss of the account
synchronization database when no backup of the database exists.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To recover from PDC server failure when there is a backup database:

1. Promote a backup domain controller (BDC) in the domain to PDC.

2. If you have not already done so, install Directory Service Manager for
   NetWare (DSMN) on the newly-promoted server.

3. Use the NET STOP MSSYNC command to stop the DSMN service on the new PDC.

4. On the new PDC, create a backup subdirectory of the
   %SystemRoot%\System32\Syncagnt directory.

5. Copy the following files from an account synchronization backup location to
   the backup directory:

   Mssync.mdb
   System.mdb
   Jetn.log
   *.pat

6. Use the Control Panel Services tool to start the DSMN service.

7. In Synchronization Manager, click Synchronize All Servers from the NetWare
   Server menu.

The synchronization may take a significant amount of time, depending on the
number of NetWare servers being synchronized, and the number of accounts being
propagated.

To recover from loss of the account synchronization database with no backup
Database, perform the following steps:

If you do not have a backup copy of the account synchronization database, you
must reconstruct your NetWare account information once you have a new PDC.

1. On each NetWare server that was participating in the domain, use NetWare
   administrative tools to delete the user account named WINNT_SYNC_AGENT.

2. To return the NetWare server bindery to the state it was in before you added
   the NetWare server to the domain, restore the bindery from a backup.

3. For each NetWare server, use Synchronization Manager to again add the server
   to the domain, specifying which accounts to propagate from the NetWare server
   to the domain and which groups to propagate back from the domain to the
   server. You will have to set a new password for each propagated user.
