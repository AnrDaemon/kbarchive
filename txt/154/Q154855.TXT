-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you configure partitions during the text mode portion of Setup on the
PowerPC (Motorola PowerStack) platform, you will see a small partition marked:

   -- System Reserved 10 MB

The size may vary, but typically, it will be a small partition. It will not be
assigned a drive letter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On the PowerPC platform, a special partition is created that contains the system
firmware. Under no conditions should this partition be deleted. If you delete
this partition, the computer will be unbootable. This partition is separate from
the normal RISC architecture system partition that contains files needed to
start the operating system. On RISC machines, the system partition should always
be FAT. If the "System Reserved" partition is accidentally deleted or damaged,
contact the hardware vendor for utilities and instructions on how to re-create
it.
