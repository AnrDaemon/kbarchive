-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Get_LUA_Return_Code function is used to map an error return code to a more
descriptive text string to display to the user. Because this function is not
present in the WINSLI32.DLL file, you may wish to display the actual error code
if an error occurs, or provide your own descriptive error messages.

CAUSE
=====

The function Get_LUA_Return_Code was inadvertently omitted from the WINSLI32.DLL
file. The function is included in the file: WINRUI32.DLL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
2.11 and 2.11.sp1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server
2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
