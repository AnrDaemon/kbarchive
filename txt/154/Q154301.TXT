PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an X.400 connector is used over a slow link, a number of different problems
can occur. In some cases the message transfer agent (MTA) stops responding and a
DRWATSON log is generated with exception e0020002 or Access Violation c0000005.
One Application Event Log error is:

   MTA error (Event ID = 9405):
   An unexpected error has occurred which may cause the MTA to terminate.
   Error: SBPDSCLS:CB TID=1,calling TID=0. [BASE TCP/IP DRVR 10] (16)

Other symptoms include the following socket errors:

   A sockets error 10060
   (WSAETIMEDOUT) event ID 9215, A sockets error 10051 (WSAENETUNREACH) event ID
   9215, A sockets error 10054 (WSAECONNRESET) event ID 9224.

WORKAROUND
==========

The problem only happens when there is insufficient bandwidth or a high number
of network errors. One workaround is increase the bandwidth available to the
MTA.

STATUS
======
