SYMPTOMS
========

After you remove and reinstall Microsoft Encarta 1996 Encyclopedia, you are
unable to access your Yearbook Builder update files.

CAUSE
=====

Removing and reinstalling Encarta 1996 Encyclopedia overwrites the Yearbook
Builder information file (Ybstate.dat) on your hard drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

To preserve your Encarta Yearbook Builder updates when you remove and reinstall
Encarta, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "ybstate.dat" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click Find Now.

3. In the list of found files, click the Ybstate.date file, on the File menu,
   click Rename.

4. Type "ybstate.sav" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

5. Run Encarta 1996 Encyclopedia Setup, and then select the Remove All Setup
   option.

6. When Setup is finished removing the program, run Encarta Setup again to
   reinstall the program.

7. Locate the new Ybstate.dat file. For information about how to find a file,
   see step 2 above.

8. Rename the file "Ybstate.new" (without quotation marks). See steps 3 and 4
   for information about how to rename a file.

9. Locate the Ybstate.sav file you renamed in steps 3 and 4, and rename the file
   "Ybstate.dat" (without quotation marks).

Your Yearbook Builder update files are now preserved in your current installation
of Encarta.
