TITLE   :SMS Err Msg: Unable to Initialize IPX Protocol
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run the Remote Control Agent on a Windows 95 client computer
using NetWare 3.1x or NetWare 4.x as the primary logon network and the Windows
95 Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks driver, you may receive the following
error message:

   Unable to initialize IPX protocol

CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server 1.2 creates a Domain.ini file on the NetWare logon
servers. The Domain.ini file includes the following section:

   [SIGHT]
   Allow Takeover=No
   Allow Reboot=No
   Allow File Transfer=No
   Allow Chat=No
   Allow Remote Execute=No
   Visible Signal=Yes
   Audible Signal=Yes
   Allow Ping Test=No
   Allow DOS Diagnostics=No
   Allow Windows Diagnostics=No
   Permission Required=Yes
   Default Protocol=IPX
   LANANUM=0
   InstallWin16RCTsr=1

The Domain.ini file is used to create the Sms.ini file on the client computer.
The Remote Control Agent configuration is stored in the [SIGHT] section of the
Sms.ini file. The default protocol for a NetWare client is configured to be IPX.
The Microsoft IPX/SPX-compatible protocol for Windows 95 clients is NWLINK$.
When the Remote Control Agent starts, it attempts to use IPX instead of NWLINK$,
which generates the error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior do one of the following:

 - Use the NetWare network drivers for Windows 95.

-or-

 - Install TCP/IP on the Windows 95 clients. Change the default protocol for
   remote control to TCP/IP in the Systems Management Server registry. Changing
   the default remote control protocol for Windows clients is documented in the
   Systems Management Server 1.2 "Administrator's Guide" on pages 168-170.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by product design.
