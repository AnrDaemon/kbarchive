======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual Basic version 3.0, the code modules contained in a form are
occasionally reordered. This problem is very noticeable when the form is under
SourceSafe control because it appears as if the entire Visual Basic form has
changed.

This causes problems for SourceSafe because when this reordering happens there is
no easy way to see just the code changes that were made by the developer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Visual Basic 4.0 does not reorder the modules in forms.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

This problem was corrected in Visual Basic version 4.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This reordering of modules in Visual Basic is not a common or consistent
occurrence. There is nothing that can be done to prevent this from happening in
Visual Basic 3.0.
