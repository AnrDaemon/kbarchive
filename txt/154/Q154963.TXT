TITLE   :DosSetSigHandler API Not Behaving as Expected in OS/2 Subsystem
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The DosSetSigHandler API does not behave as it should in the Windows NT OS/2
SubSystem when called with a NULL Handler and SIGA_IGNORE, as in the following
example:

   DosSetSigHandler(NULL,..,SIGA_IGNORE)

CAUSE
=====

In the OS/2 Subsystem a macro was generating an incorrect address in the case
where a null handler value was passed in as a parameter.

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the fix mentioned below. The solution was to recognize the null value and
flag the IGNORE parameter. This is the expected behavior for DosSetSigHandler
handling in this case.


STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
