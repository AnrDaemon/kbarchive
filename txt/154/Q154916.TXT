SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to switch to a running Control Panel tool using either the ALT+TAB
key combination or Task Manager, the tool is not in the list of running
programs.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. Control Panel tools are treated as modeless dialog
boxes, and as such are always part of Control Panel. The same behavior occurs if
you try to switch to a property sheet dialog box.

RESOLUTION
==========

To switch to the running Control Panel tool, use one of the following methods:

 - Use ALT-ESC to set the focus back on the desired Control Panel tool.

   -or-

 - Use the mouse to select the tool on the desktop.

   -or-

 - Switch to Control Panel and open the tool again.
