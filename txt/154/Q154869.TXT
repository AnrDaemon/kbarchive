SUMMARY
=======

When trying to use the database features of Visual Basic, you may receive the
error message "Too many client tasks." This occurs when more than 10
applications running on the same machine try to use the Jet database engine.

CAUSE
=====

The Jet database engine versions 1.1, 2.0, and 2.5 can only be used by 10 client
applications simultaneously on any one machine.

WORKAROUND
==========

It is not possible to have more than 10 client applications making use of the
16-bit Jet database engine on one machine. If it is essential that a software
system have more than 10 executables on the same machine with access to one or
more databases, the system could be designed with one "server" exe accessing the
database and multiple "client" programs making requests for data from this
"server" via an inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism. For example, with
Visual Basic version 4.0, this could be achieved using OLE automation.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

(This is not an issue with Jet 3.0 as used by Visual Basic 4.0 32-bit.)
