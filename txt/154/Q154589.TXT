PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Exchange Administrator attempts to start the Microsoft Exchange
Internet Mail Connector service in Control Panel Services, the following pop-up
error may be encountered:

   Stop "Could not start the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector service
   on ..."

   Error 2140: An internal Windows NT error occurred.

The following event will be logged in the event viewer:

   EventID 4058
   Category: Intialization/Termination

   The Internet Mail Connector cannot start because the name resolver cannot be
   initialized. Check your network settings in the Control Panel to ensure that
   you have set a domain name in the DNS dialog box of the TCP/IP configuration.

CAUSE
=====

The TCP/IP protocol has been configured for domain name server (DNS), but the
DNS is not currently configured properly. The DNS Domain Name box maybe blank.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Open Control Panel, click Network, and select the TCP/IP Protocol.

2. Select Configure.

3. Select DNS.

4. At the DNS Configuration dialog box, enter some letters(it does not matter
   what the letters are) in the "Domain Name" box.

5. Click OK, OK, and OK.

Now the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector service can be successfully
started.
