TITLE   :XADM: DS/IS Fails to Re-create Mailboxes in Subcontainers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In certain cases of disaster recovery it may be necessary to use the DS/IS
Consistency Checker to re-populate the Directory Store with the mailboxes that
exist in the Private Information Store. If some of these users were located in
subcontainers of the default Recipients container (or any subcontainer of a
container that is on the same level as the default Recipients container)the
DS/IS Consistency checker will fail to create the Directory object for these
users with the following error in the application log.

The Event viewer will report as follows:

   Event ID: 7014
   Source: MS ExchangeIS Private
   Type: Information
   Category: Private IS/DS

   Description:
   Unable to add a mailbox
   /O=MICROSOFT/OU=ONE/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SUBCONTAINER1/CN=USER2 to the Directory
   service because the organization or site of the mailbox is different from
   this server's organization or site.

CAUSE
=====

The DS/IS consistency checker assumes no longer than two /CN (common name)
fields in the X.500 distinguished name. This means that the first /CN would be
used for the server name and the second /CN for the first container. By not
checking any further than two /CN's the object is assumed to not be a part of
this site and fails with the above stated error.

WORKAROUND
==========

Mailboxes that exist in such subcontainers must be re-created manually, using
the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
