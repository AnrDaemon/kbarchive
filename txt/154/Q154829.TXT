TITLE   :PRB: Rights by Project Are Not Always Inherited
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a project's rights are changed under the Rights by Project option, and the
project is moved so it becomes a subproject of a higher level (parent) project,
it will not inherit the parent project's rights.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, create three projects off the root
   project: ProjectA, ProjectB & ProjectC.

2. In the Visual SourceSafe Administrator, enable Rights by Project. For the
   user Guest, set the rights as follows:

      - ProjectA  - Read
      - ProjectB  - All (leave default)
      - ProjectC  - Read

   Close the Project Rights Dialog.

3. Reopen the Dialog and change the ProjectC rights to All.

4. In the Explorer, as a user who has all rights, move ProjectB and ProjectC
   into ProjectA. Add a file to each project.

5. In the Explorer, as the user Guest, attempt to check out the file from
   ProjectA, ProjectB and ProjectC. Note the following results:

    - ProjectA: The "Insufficient Rights" dialog appears. The Guest's rights
      were set to Read and never changed. The project was not moved.

    - ProjectB: The "Insufficient Rights" dialog appears. The project's rights
      were never changed, so it inherited the settings from the parent project.

    - ProjectC: The file can be checked out. Like ProjectB, this file was moved
      but did not inherit rights from the parent as might be expected. Changing
      its rights prior to the move caused it to retain those settings.
