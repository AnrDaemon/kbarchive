TITLE   :Cannot Open Other's Calendar File with SP4 or Later
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51 SP4,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 SP4, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 SP4, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade Windows NT 3.51 to Service Pack 4 or upgrade to Windows NT
4.0, a Schedule+ 1.0a user on one Novell server who tries to open the
appointment book of another Schedule+ 1.0a user on another Novell server will
receive the following error:

   The schedule file could not be opened. You may not have the necessary access
   privileges or the file may be unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

A fix in the Client Services for NetWare redirector, Nwrdr.sys, created this
problem in Schedule+ 1.0a.

NOTE: Schedule+ 1.0a is not the workgroup version of Schedule+ that ships with
Windows NT. It is an enterprise version of Schedule+ that can communicate with
multiple postoffices. The workgroup version of Schedule+ will return the same
error, but this is by design because the workgroup version is not aware of
multiple of postoffices.
