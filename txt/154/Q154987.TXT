TITLE   :Cannot Use Reserved Names with SYSDIFF
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfile kbsetup kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Sysdiff and use a reserved name (such as CON, PRN, LPTx, or COMx,
where x is 1 through 9) for the output file, Dr. Watson reports that an error
occurred.

CAUSE
=====

CON, PRN, LPTx, COMx, and so on are reserved names to be used exclusively by the
operating system. You cannot use these names for file names.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix below, or wait for the next service
pack. Please note that you must rebuild any packages that were built using the
previous Sysdiff.exe.

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/NT40/utilities/Sysdiff-fix

NOTE: This version of Sysdiff replaces the version that ships with Service Pack
3.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
