The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0

SUMMARY
=======

When Systems Management Server is configured to automatically configure
workstation login scripts, it will not modify the user profile for the
Administrator and Guest accounts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Systems Management Server can be configured take the inventory of a computer
each time it logs on to a domain. This is accomplished with the account's login
script. Systems Management Server will create a script (Smsls.bat/.cmd) and
assign it to accounts that did not previously have a logon script or will add
the necessary lines to those that do. This automatic configuration does not
assign a script to the Administrator and Guest accounts of a domain. This is by
design.

If the user profiles of the Administrator or Guest accounts are configured to run
a login script that is also shared by a normal user account, Systems Management
Server will configure the existing .bat or .cmd file to call SMSLS. This is the
only way to automatically configure the Administrator or Guest accounts to
execute Systems Management Server client setup and inventory.
