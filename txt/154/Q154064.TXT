======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Controlling what printer a program prints to can be accomplished through code
with the enhancements to the SET PRINTER TO command in Visual FoxPro run with
QuickDraw GX and some other new functions. This article provides a sample
program combining the SYS(1038), the JustCSName() and the SET PRINTER TO NAME
enhancements to illustrate how to control which printer a report is printed to.

NOTE: QuickDraw GX is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make
no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding the performance or reliability of
QuickDraw GX.

QuickDraw GX is not supported in Macintosh OS 8 and this sample program will not
work with Visual FoxPro running under OS 8.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Program
--------------

The following sample program assumes that QuickDraw GX is installed, that at
least two printers are set up, and that their icons are on the desktop:

      *** Beginning of sample program
      IF SYS(1038)
      desktop=SUBSTR(SYS(2033),1,AT(':',SYS(2033)))+"\Desktop Folder\"
      numPrinters=ADIR(prtList, desktop+"*.*",'','dvcf')
      SET LIBRARY TO HOME()+"FoxTools.cfm" ADDITIVE
      FOR x=1 TO numPrinters
       SET PRINTER TO NAME JustCSName(desktop+prtList[(x),1])
         REPORT FORM "somereport.frx" NOEJECT NOCONSOLE TO PRINTER
         ? SET("Printer",2)
      ENDFOR
      SET LIBRARY TO
      ENDIF
      *** End of sample program

Program Commentary
------------------

The first line in the program checks to see if QuickDraw GX is installed by using
the SYS(1038) function.

The second line determines the name of the Macintosh's hard drive by using the
SYS(2033) function, and appends "Desktop Folder" to it.

The third line checks to see how many QuickDraw GX printer icons are on the
desktop and stores their names in an array named "prtList". The 'dvcf' in the
fourth argument of the ADIR() function is the creator type of the QuickDraw GX
printer icons.

The fourth line loads the FoxTools.cfm library, which is necessary for the use of
the JustCSName function.

The fifth line is the beginning of a FOR loop that executes once for each
QuickDraw GX printer icon found on the desktop.

The sixth line (the first one in the FOR loop) sets the printer to one of the
QuickDraw GX printers found on the desktop.

The seventh line prints a predefined report.

The eighth line reports the name of the current QuickDraw GX printer to the
current output device (the Visual FoxPro screen).
