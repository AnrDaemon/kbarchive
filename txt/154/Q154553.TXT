SUMMARY
=======

On a Windows NT 4.0 Domain Name System (DNS), Reverse WINS lookups are made
through node status requests, not through WINS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the WINS database is not indexed by IP addresses, Windows NT 4.0 Domain
Naming System (DNS) does not send a reverse name lookup to WINS to get the
computer's name given its IP address. Instead, it sends a node status request
directly to the given IP address

   NBT: NS: Query req. for *<00...(15)>

and gets the NetBIOS name from the node status response:

   NBT: NS: Query (Node Status) resp. for *<00...(15)>, Success

The DNS then appends the domain name to the NetBIOS name and returns the results
to its clients.

Additional query words: prodnt ntdns
