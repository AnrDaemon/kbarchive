The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

You can manage user access to Internet Information Server (IIS) servers by time
of day. By default, all users (as anonymous guests) have accesses to IIS servers
at all hours of the day. The available hours can be limited through the User
Manager for Domains program on a domain controller.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To control accessibility to published web pages at any given hour for all users,
following the steps below:

1. On a domain controller, start the User Manager for Domains.

2. Double-click the user IUSR_<computername>.

   NOTE: This account controls all user access to IIS responses, including named
   users in the domain and administrators, unless anonymous logon is revoked
   then all IIS users must be domain users.

3. Click the Hours icon at the bottom of the user properties screen.

4. The Logon Hours grid presents all seven days of the week with hourly boxes
   Midnight to 11:59 P.M. The default is all hours allowed. To change the status
   of an hour or range of hours, click the selected hour and select a range of
   hours.

5. With the hour or range selected, click the Allow or Disallow button to change
   the status. Disallowed hours will cause a break in the hours of service line.


When correctly configured, an HTTP request will receive the following error
message during the disallowed hours:

   HTTP/1.0 500 Server Error (Logon failure: account logon time
   restriction violation.)

To completely block IIS availability, disable the account in the User Properties
dialog box for IUSR_<computername>.

When the account is disabled, an HTTP request will receive the following error:

   HTTP/1.0 500 Server Error (Logon failure: account currently disabled.)
