PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler

KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbMFC kbODBC KbUIDesign kbVC kbVC500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you build the ENROLL tutorial, you will see that there is a "+" Toolbar
button that brings up the About dialog box instead of adding new records. The
additional buttons, "\", "-" and "?" are not present.

CAUSE
=====

The Enroll.rc file is missing for the Toolbar buttons even though the bitmap for
the Toolbar has images for all the buttons in it.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Toolbar section has the following IDs listed in Enroll.rc:

      // Toolbar
      // 

      IDR_MAINFRAME TOOLBAR DISCARDABLE  16, 15
      BEGIN
          BUTTON      ID_EDIT_CUT
          BUTTON      ID_EDIT_COPY
          BUTTON      ID_EDIT_PASTE
          SEPARATOR
          BUTTON      ID_FILE_PRINT
          SEPARATOR
          BUTTON      ID_RECORD_FIRST
          BUTTON      ID_RECORD_PREV
          BUTTON      ID_RECORD_NEXT
          BUTTON      ID_RECORD_LAST
          SEPARATOR
          BUTTON      ID_APP_ABOUT
      END

The IDs should be the following:

      // Toolbar
      // 

      IDR_MAINFRAME TOOLBAR DISCARDABLE  16, 15
      BEGIN
          BUTTON      ID_EDIT_CUT
          BUTTON      ID_EDIT_COPY
          BUTTON      ID_EDIT_PASTE
          SEPARATOR
          BUTTON      ID_FILE_PRINT
          SEPARATOR
          BUTTON      ID_RECORD_FIRST
          BUTTON      ID_RECORD_PREV
          BUTTON      ID_RECORD_NEXT
          BUTTON      ID_RECORD_LAST
          SEPARATOR
          BUTTON      ID_RECORD_ADD
          BUTTON      ID_RECORD_REFRESH
          BUTTON      ID_RECORD_DELETE
          SEPARATOR
          BUTTON      ID_APP_ABOUT
      END

Open Enroll.rc as a text file in MSDEV. Go to the Toolbar section, and add the
following four lines after "BUTTON ID_RECORD_LAST":

      SEPARATOR
      BUTTON      ID_RECORD_ADD
      BUTTON      ID_RECORD_REFRESH
      BUTTON      ID_RECORD_DELETE

Rebuilding the application should fix the problem.
