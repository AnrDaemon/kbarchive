SUMMARY
=======

Running English Microsoft Exchange clients on Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS)
operating systems is not supported and not recommended by Microsoft because the
English Microsoft Exchange clients are not enabled for DBCS operating systems
and have not been tested on DBCS operating systems.

Support for Microsoft Windows NT Workstation is being considered for future
releases. Microsoft will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
