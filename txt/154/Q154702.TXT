TITLE   :Cannot Start Directory Service Manager for NetWare (DSMN)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Server fails to start Directory Service Manager for NetWare (DSMN)
services.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can install DSMN on the primary domain controller (PDC) and backup domain
controller (BDC). However, you can only run DSMN on servers functioning as the
primary domain controller. In cases where the PDC is not available, you must
promote the BDC to a PDC before the DSMN service can be started.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the PDC fails and you do not have DSMN installed on any BDC, you must promote
one of the BDCs to be a PDC before installing DSMN on this server. Failure to do
this will result in an error message stating that the domain controller is not
found.
