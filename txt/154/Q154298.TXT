TITLE   :XFOR: Mail Going to IMC or MSMail Stays in Outbox
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send mail to an Internet address, the message stays in the
Outbox. Mail sent to a MSMail 3.2 postoffice through the MSMail Connector also
stays in the Outbox.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs when the Microsoft Exchange Service Account does not have the
correct permissions on the Configuration object. The Microsoft Exchange Service
Account requires Service Account Admin permissions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the permission problems:

1. Select the Configuration Container in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
   program.

2. Click the File menu, and then click Properties. Click the Permissions tab and
   give the Microsoft Exchange Service Account the service account
   administration role.

3. Stop and restart both the Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) and
   Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) for the change to take
   effect.

NOTE: This can also occur if the account used for any of the related Microsoft
Exchange services has been changed. To verify that the appropriate account has
been specified, check the startup of each Microsoft Exchange service in the
Services control panel.
