TITLE   :SMS: Client Does Not Deinstall for All Users
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetup smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On a Windows NT or Windows 95 client that is used by multiple users (multiple
logons and profiles), when Systems Management Server is deinstalled using
Deinstal.bat, CLI_NT /R, or CLI_DOS /R, the Systems Management Server files are
removed, but Systems Management Server references in the registry are left for
all users other than the one that ran the deinstall.

This causes the following two problems for the user profiles that did not run the
deinstallation program:

 - The Systems Management Server Client Program Group is not removed. When users
   click on one of the icons, they will receive an error message saying that the
   file specified could not be found.

 - The Smsrun16/32 file is left in the load key in the registry causing the
   following error message on startup:

   Cannot find file Smsrun32.exe/Smsrun16.exe specified in the Win.ini (or one
   of its components); check to ensure the path and filename are correct and
   that all required libraries are available.

CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server does not currently support multiple users on one
computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

Each user needs to run the deinstallation program individually.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
