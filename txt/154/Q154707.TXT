TITLE   :Error Running #COMMAND /C Capture.exe from Login Script

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Error 255 is reported in line 668 of Spool.c when the login script containing
the following line is run:

   #COMMAND /c CAPTURE /S=servername /Q=quename

CAUSE
=====

Capture.exe is not a supported application; it often fails when run from the
command prompt. The login script processor does not actually run Capture.exe.
Instead, it parses the command #CAPTURE and works in the background. Therefore,
when you use the above command, you are running the actual Capture.exe file.

This is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

Replace the above line with the following:

   #CAPTURE /S=<servername> /Q=<queuename>
