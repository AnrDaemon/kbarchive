TITLE   :ADT2: ADT Application’s Setup Cannot Find MSSetup.dll
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the Microsoft Access Setup Wizard and copy the contents of your
disk image folders to diskettes using a computer running Windows 95, you may
receive the following error message when you run Setup.exe from Disk 1:

   Setup cannot access required initialization file: 'A:\MSSETUP.DLL'.

CAUSE
=====

By default, Windows 95 hides .dll files in Explorer; therefore, MSSetup.dll did
not get copied to the diskette.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Windows 95 Explorer, click Options on the View menu, and click the "Show all
files" option on the View tab. Then, copy the Disk 1 folder's contents to the
diskette again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the Microsoft Access Setup Wizard in Windows 95 to create 1.2 megabyte
   (MB) or 1.44 MB disk images for a run-time application.

2. In the Windows 95 Explorer, click Options on the View menu, and click the
   "Hide files of these types:" option on the View tab. (This is the default
   selection when you install Windows 95.)

3. Copy the files in your Disk 1 image folder to a diskette.

4. Run Setup.exe from the diskette.
