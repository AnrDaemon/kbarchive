TITLE   :Error Changing Password with Multiple Network User Names

KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork win95

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to change a network password using the Passwords tool in Control
Panel, you may receive an error message similar to one of the following
messages:

 - Unable to change the password for Microsoft Networking because of the
   following error: The username cannot be found

 - Unable to change the password for Microsoft Networking because of the
   following error: Incorrect password

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if you have multiple network clients installed and you are
logged on using a different user name for each client. For example, this error
occurs if you use one user name for the Client for Microsoft Networks and
another user name for the Client for NetWare networks.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use either of the following methods:

 - Use the same user name for all network clients.

 - Use the appropriate command-line tool to change your password. For a
   Microsoft Network password, use the NET PASSWORD command. For a Novell
   NetWare Network password, use the SETPASS command.

   The NET PASSWORD command works in MS-DOS mode. To make the NET PASSWORD
   command work in an MS-DOS session within Windows 95, follow these steps:

   1. Use the right mouse button to click the MS-DOS Prompt icon, and then click
      Properties.

   2. Click the Program tab, and then click Advanced.

   3. Click the "Prevent MS-DOS-based programs from detecting Windows" check box
      to select it.

   4. Click OK.

   5. Restart the computer.

      If you do not follow these steps and you try to use the NET PASSWORD
      command in an MS-DOS session within Windows 95, you receive the following
      error message:

   Error 3547: You cannot do this from within an MS-DOS window

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 does not provide for changing passwords using the Passwords tool in
Control Panel when multiple user names are used.
