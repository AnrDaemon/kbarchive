TITLE   :SFM: Macintosh Client Cannot Connect to Windows NT Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT Server has a license logging service (LLS) that maintains a database
of licensed users. When you exceed the number of available licenses, clients
receive a warning dialog box. The warning message text is different depending on
the client attempting to log on to the Windows NT server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A client, when using on of the following methods, may receive one of the
following error messages when attempting to connect to a Windows NT server:

When a Macintosh client connects to Windows NT server using the Apple Standard
UAMS:

   This file server will not allow any additional users to log on. Try
   again later.

When a Macintosh client connects to Windows NT server using Microsoft
Authentication:

   Server was unable to open another session.

Additional licenses must be purchased to bring the server up to compliance with
the license logging service. When new licenses have been purchased, open Control
Panel, open Licensing, and increase the number of client licenses to the correct
number you have purchased. When the Windows NT Server is installed from a
not-for-resale (NFR) edition of Microsoft BackOffice, there is a limit on the
total number of clients able to log on to the server. The following message will
appear if the administrator attempts to go into the Control Panel and open
Licensing.

   Not Available in NFR (Not For Resale) Edition of BackOffice

The administrator must choose OK in the dialog box that indicates compliance to
the special agreement with the NFR product before the Licensing Manager will
close. The NFR version is for demonstration only and is not to be used in
production environments, and upgrading the NFR product to the full retail
version is not supported.
