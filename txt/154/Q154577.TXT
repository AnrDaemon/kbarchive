KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork kbDatabase kbSCMan kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smsdatabase smssiteconfigman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the site properties, the changes are processed and appear
current, but the changes do not actually take effect. In the Hman.log file, you
find the following line:

   Site Control Image in the database is newer, reuse that database copy.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the date on your site computer is set to a future date
(for example, 08/08/99) and you change the site properties. If you then set the
date back to the actual date and try to change the site properties again, no
changes take effect.

The changes would eventually take effect on the future date that was previously
set on the site computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do either of the following:

 - Restore the Systems Management Server database from a backup that was made
   when your computer was running with the actual time and date.

   -or-

 - Remove and reinstall your Systems Management Server site.
