TITLE   :IIS FTP Server Does Not Use Continuation Character Correctly
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The FTP service in Internet Information Server versions 1.0 and 2.0 with
directory annotation enabled uses a space for a continuation character in a
multi-line response rather than a minus sign (-) as per RFC 959.

Notice the correct behavior below with the Microsoft Windows NT FTP Server. The
230 line is followed immediately by the continuation character (-):

230------------------------------------------------------------------------

and here with the IIS FTP Server it is incorrect

230 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

This can create problems for auto connecting ftp clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server versions 1.0 and 2.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to J. Postel & J. Reynolds, RFC 959 - File Transfer Protocol
(1985), page 35:

   "Thus the format for multi-line replies is that the first line will begin
   with the exact required reply code, followed immediately by a Hyphen, "-"
   (also known as Minus), followed by text. The last line will begin with the
   same code, followed immediately by Space <SP>, optionally some text,
   and the Telnet end-of-line code."
