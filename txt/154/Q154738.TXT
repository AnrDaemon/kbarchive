TITLE   :"Connect Network Drive" Caches First Credentials Supplied
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a remote resource using the Connect As and Reconnect At
Logon options within either File Manager or Windows Explorer, Windows NT caches
the first set of credentials supplied, even if these credentials are invalid and
fail to provide access to the remote resource. Subsequent attempts to access the
remote resource with valid credentials will give the user access to the
resource, but do not change the cached credentials used when reconnecting.

WORKAROUND
==========

Be sure to provide the correct set of credentials when filling in the Map
Network Drive dialog box.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Open Windows Explorer and click Map Network Drive.

2. Specify the standard UNC \\<servername>\<sharename>.

3. Specify a <DomainName>\<UserName> in the Connect As field,
   misspelling either the DomainName or the UserName.

4. Click the Reconnect At Logon check box.

5. Click OK.

6. You can now correct your mistake from step 3 by typing the properly spelled
   DomainName or UserName. Also type the password.

7. Click OK. You should now be mapped to a resource.

8. Log off and then log on again.

9. During the logon sequence, you will be prompted to provide credentials to
   reconnect to the resource. Note that the misspelled DomainName or UserName is
   displayed, and you cannot change either one. You must click Cancel at this
   point. Also, you should click the "Do not Try to Restore this Connection in
   the Future" check box.
