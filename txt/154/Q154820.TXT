SYMPTOMS
========

When you have set the common dialog controls FontName property, displaying the
Font common dialog can result in the selected font being blank.

CAUSE

The problem is caused by setting the FontName property before setting the Flags
property. It also occurs when the Flags property has already been set.

RESOLUTION
==========

Flags property to the desired combination of flags after setting the FontName
property.

======
