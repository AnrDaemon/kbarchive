TITLE   :SMS: PCM Executes Mandatory Jobs over Slow Links
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After creating a job and selecting the Not Mandatory over Slow Link option, the
package should not execute on a client that has connected to the network over a
slow link. This does not work. Package Command Manager (PCM) executes mandatory
jobs over slow network links anyway. This occurs even though Systems Management
Server has detected a slow link.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
