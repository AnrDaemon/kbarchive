TITLE   :Stop 0xA in Afd.sys
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAPI kbSDKPlatform kbWinsock kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following Stop 0xA message may be received when a server/client application
uses TCP/IP sockets to transfer data:

   Stop 0xA in Afd.sys (0x0000000c,0x00000002,0x00000000,0xfa13f0b6)

CAUSE
=====

The stop error occurs because a packet has been received and indicated up the
stack after the connection has been aborted. Under certain undefined
circumstances, Windows NT tries to use the connection after it has been
dereferenced.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A fix
to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
