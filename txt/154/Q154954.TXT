SUMMARY

or to sort by Last Modified Date.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the sort option for the Recipients container, select Sort from the
View menu. The sort order can also be changed by clicking the column heading, an
arrow will appear to denote the sort option selected.

The Microsoft Exchange Administrator program allows for many different column
headings to be displayed. Select Columns from the View menu to see the column
headings you can select. The column headings can be arranged in any order but
sorting options for the headings are not available, even when clicking the
column heading.

The Display Name is taken from the Dir.edb file located in the DSADATA
subdirectory on the Microsoft Exchange Server. The directory can be accessed by
using MAPI commands.
