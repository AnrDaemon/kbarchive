SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running ODBC applications using Microsoft ODBC drivers, you may
receive the following error message:

   General error
   Failed to get the expression service

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if ODBC applications connect to and disconnect from the
server repeatedly (over 50-60 times).

An example of such an application may be an Internet Web server applica- tion
that is publishing ODBC data. For each Web-page-based query, the Web server may
be opening a connection to the ODBC data source, processing the query, and then
disconnecting from the data source.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. An update
to address this problem is now available, but is not fully regression tested and
should be applied only to computers experiencing this specific problem. Unless
you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this update at this time.
