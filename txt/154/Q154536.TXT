The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

In Systems Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1, a client only asks you once
if you will permit the console to connect. This is true for each Helpdesk option
(that is, Viewing, Reboot, and so forth).

In Systems Management Server version 1.2, each time the server attempts to
connect to a client, you are prompted to allow the console to connect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Systems Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1, if the Remote Control Options
on a client are set to Permission Required, and permission is granted once,
subsequent attempts to remotely control the computer do not require permission
until Windows is exited and restarted.

The design was changed in Systems Management Server 1.2. When the Permission
Required option is enabled, every attempt to initiate a Remote Control session
generates a prompt asking if you want to allow Remote Control.
