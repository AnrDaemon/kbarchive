TITLE   :Cannot Access Network with Intel EtherExpress Pro Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbnetwork kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have an Intel EtherExpress Pro Ethernet Adapter installed in your
computer, you may experience any of the following symptoms:

 - You cannot access the network.

 - If you are configured as a DHCP client, you receive the following message
   when you start Windows NT 4.0:

   The DHCP client could not obtain an IP address.

   If you want to see DHCP messages in the future, choose YES, otherwise choose
   NO.

 - Event ID 1003 is logged in the System.log file and visible in Event Viewer
   with the following detail:

   DHCP failed to obtain a lease for the card with network address <12-digit
   hexadecimal MAC address of the local network adapter>. The following error
   occurred: The semaphore timeout period had expired.

CAUSE
=====

The drivers for the Intel EtherExpress Pro Ethernet adapters included with
Windows NT 4.0 default to a transceiver type setting of Thick Net (AUI/DIX). If
your network adapter is configured for any other type of connection, such as
Thinnet (BNC/Coax) or Twisted Pair (TPE), these errors can occur.


RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the transceiver type for the Intel EtherExpress Pro adapter to use the
Auto Connect setting. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click the Network Neighborhood icon on the
   desktop, and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

2. Click the Adapters tab, click Intel EtherExpress Pro Ethernet Adapter, and
   then click Properties.

3. In the Transceiver Type box, click Auto Connect, or click the connection type
   that matches your installation.

4. Click OK.
