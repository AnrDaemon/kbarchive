SUMMARY

This article discusses how to play the games included with Magic School Bus
Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs (MSB Dinosaurs).

GAME DESCRIPTIONS
-----------------

Meteor Meltdown - Jurassic COLORADO:

The object of the game is to eat as many plants on the face of the volcano as
possible while avoiding the rising and falling floodwater and the falling
meteors. You use the arrow keys to move your dinosaur from side to side and up
and down. You can choose to be one of two players: Stegosaurus or Hypsilophodon.
You receive PaleoCards for completing levels. There is a high score table
presented at the conclusion of the game.

Nest Watch Game - Cretaceous MONGOLIA:

The goal of this arcade-style game is to protect a dinosaur nest from
egg-stealing predators. Click on the oncoming predators with the cursor, and the
mother dinosaur will prevent the predators from reaching the young dinosaurs and
the nest. You win PaleoCards as you successfully progress through the levels and
protect the nest. A high score table is displayed at the end of the game.

Marathon - Jurassic TANZANIA:

This is an arcade-style game in which the player controls a running dinosaur that
is being chased by a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The goal is to avoid the various
obstacles using the arrow keys and keep running until you reach the finish line.
You complete a level by crossing the finish line without stumbling too many
times and being caught by the hungry Tyrannosaurus Rex. As you advance to each
new level, you must run farther to reach the finish line.

Dino Madness - Triassic ARGENTINA:

This is a board game. The object of this game is to make it to the end of the
trail before your opponent. You progress along the trail by solving the
challenges along the way. Play begins by clicking on the dice in the center of
the screen. You move ahead the number of spaces indicated on the dice by
correctly answering the question you are presented with. You can choose to play
a single player game, in which case you compete against Liz, or you can choose a
two-player game and compete against another person.

Skeleton Puzzle - Triassic ARGENTINA:

In this game, you are given the silhouette of a dinosaur and several puzzle
pieces. The puzzle pieces consist of bones and sections of the skeleton. You
must put them in their correct places. When the skeleton is completed properly,
it is colored-in so that you can see a picture of the dinosaur. After completing
each puzzle, you are presented with another skeleton that needs to be assembled.
The order of the puzzles goes from Triassic dinosaurs to Cretaceous dinosaurs.
You win a PaleoCard each time you successfully complete a puzzle.

Foot Print Puzzle - Jurassic TANZANIA:

The object of this game is to assemble the pieces of a puzzle so that they form a
picture of prehistoric ground with various dinosaur footprints on it. Click on
the arrow keys at the bottom of the screen to scroll through the various pieces
of the puzzle. When the puzzle is assembled correctly, dinosaurs walk across the
screen, stepping in the footprints, and you receive a PaleoCard.

Name Game - Cretaceous MONGOLIA:

The object of this game is to arrange colored stones, each of which has a
distinctive sound associated with it, so that the stones form the pronunciation
of the dinosaur at the top of the screen. You must place each one of the colored
stones in a different depression. Once you have placed the stones, you click on
the button that has a mouth on it. The sounds of the stones are pronounced in
the order in which they are arranged in the depressions. You must rearrange the
stones until the pronunciation of the name of the dinosaur is correct. After the
name is correctly pronounced, you are told the meaning of the dinosaur name
while a small animation of the dinosaur is played.

Dino-Sizer - Triassic ARIZONA:

The object of this game is to match the size of certain dinosaurs with ordinary
objects. A picture of an object is placed on the screen, and you are asked to
click on the dinosaur that is the same size as the object. When you click on the
correct dinosaur, the dinosaur walks up to the object to demonstrate that it was
nearly the same size or height.
