TITLE   :Msg Sent from MSMail Windows NT Client Undeliverable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message from the Microsoft Mail for Windows NT Client to an
address such as the following:

   <net>/<postoffice>/<mailbox>

you may receive a non-delivery message similar to the following:

   From: POSTMASTER
   To: < sender of message >
   Subject: Mail failure
   Date: Thursday, May 23, 1996 3:22PM

   FROM: < sender of message >
   TO: < recipient of message >                      DATE: 23-05-96
                                                     TIME: 15:22

   SUBJECT: < subject of message >

  ----------------------------------------------------------------

   [003] Message hop count exceeded.  Message followed the following route:

      NETCAD/HBPO01
      NETCAD/BUPO01
      NETGRI1/RH02
      NETGRI1/IH01
      NETSIS/WO01
      NETSIS/EUO01
      NETSIS/HUB02
      NETUFE/HUB01
      NETUFE/HUB03
      NETUDI/UDIPO1

CAUSE
=====

The non-delivery report is generated when the number of hops reaches 10,
regardless of the hop count setting as configured in the Administrator program.
The Windows NT client does not pick up the administrator-set hop count from the
postoffice. The client inserts a hop count of ten in all messages.

WORKAROUND
==========

Reduce the number of mail hops (routings through postoffices) to ensure that
mail reaches the destination postoffice in fewer than 10 hops. This is the
preferred solution in cases where it is feasible.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
