TITLE   :XCLN: Inserting File Via Shortcut Doesn't Work Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to insert a file from a directory shortcut into a message by
double-clicking the shortcut, the shortcut file itself appears in the message
instead of the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95 opening the directory
and allowing you to select files from a selection box.

The Windows 95 Windows Messaging System client (included with Windows 95) and
Microsoft Office95 products work as expected.


WORKAROUND
==========

Install Wordmail support for the Microsoft Exchange client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
