The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Mastering Microsoft Access Programming ISBN 1-55615-912-9, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive a "File Not Found" error when attempting to view video or
graphic files in Mastering Microsoft Access Programming.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the application is unable to open files on the CD-ROM
for binary input in order to extract size information out of the file header.
This process fails when either no drivers are installed or only Real-mode
drivers have been installed for the CD-ROM device.

RESOLUTION
==========

To verify that your computer is running Protect Mode CD drivers, follow these
steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System Control Panel.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

4. Examine the list of devices under Computer. If CD-ROM appears in this list,
   then you are running Windows 95 Protect Mode drivers.

To remove any existing Real Mode CD drivers, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

2. In the Open field, type "sysedit" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click OK.

3. Examine the Autoexec.bat file. Look for a line referencing the file
   MSCDEX.EXE. For example:

   C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\MSCDEX.EXE /D:CDROM01

   Remark out this line by placing "REM " at the beginning of the line.

4. Examine the Config.sys file. Look for a line containing an identical string
   to the "/D:" string identified above. For example:

   DEVICEHIGH=C:\CDROM\IDECD.SYS /D:CDROM01

   Remark out this line by placing "REM " at the beginning of the line.

5. Exit the System Configuration Editor. When you are prompted to save your
   changes, click Yes.

To install Protect Mode CD drivers, follow these steps:

NOTE: If your computer is already running Protect Mode CD drivers, the following
steps are not necessary.

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Add New Hardware icon.

3. Allow the Add New Hardware Wizard to detect your CD-ROM device.
