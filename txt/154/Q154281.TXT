======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your computer, the Microsoft Plus! logo screen may no longer
appear.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Logo.sys file is missing from the root folder of
the physical boot drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

Extract a new copy of the Logo.sys file from your original Microsoft Plus! disks
or CD-ROM to the root folder of the physical boot drive. For example, if your
hard disk is compressed with DriveSpace, extract the Logo.sys file to the root
folder of drive H.

For information about using the Extract tool, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION

When you run DriveSpace to compress your hard disk, the Logo.sys file is moved
to the root folder of the compressed volume, and is no longer available in the
root folder of the physical boot drive.
