TITLE   :Remote Admin Can Access a File for Which Everyone Has No Access
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An administrator from a remote client running a browser that supports NTLM
authentication is able to access a file for which 'everyone' has no access.

Example:

The file \inetsrv\wwwroot\samples\disclaim.htm has permissions set for everyone
as no access. The Server is configured for Anonymous Authentication and Windows
NT Challenge/Response Authentication. A remote client running the browser can do
NTLM authentication. Access the url http://IIS-Server/samples/disclaim.htm

Internet Information Server IIS will let you view the file after a sequence of
NTLM challenge/response messages, if you are an administrator on the server
computer.

If the user logged on to the remote client is not an administrator on the server,
then access is denied. Also, if you run the browser locally on the IIS computer
while logged on as an administrator and try to access the same URL, you get the
correct error message:

   Error: Access is Denied.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the fix referenced below, or upgrade to Windows NT 4.0.
