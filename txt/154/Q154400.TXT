TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Map File to the Project "$" Message in Dev Studio
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When adding the files of a Visual C++ project to Source Code Control, you may
get the error:

   "Can't map file to the Project $"

This may be caused by a corrupt .mdp file in Developer Studio.

WORKAROUND
==========

One solution is to remove the .mdp file and reopen the project using the .mak
file. The following will recreate the .mdp file:

1. From the File menu, choose Open Workspace.

2. Choose Makefiles (*.mak) from the list files of type ComboBox.

3. Select the appropriate makefile, and choose OK.

Add the project again. You should be able to see, select, and create projects in
Visual SourceSafe from the Add SourceSafe Project dialog.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The .mdp file is a wrapper for the .mak file that contains Visual SourceSafe
information about the project. Developer Studio can recreate this file, if
needed.

Also, if any of the files from your project did manage to get put into the $/
project in Visual SourceSafe, they should be removed.
