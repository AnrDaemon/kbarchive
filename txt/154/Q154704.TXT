SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT connection will not clear from the Novell server about 90 percent
of the time. These connections remain until you shut down and restart the
system. If the user has a limited number of connections, they may receive the
following message upon log on:

   You Cannot Be Authenticated On <server name> Do You Want To Select
   Another Preferred Server?

The problem occurs under the following conditions:

 - Connect to a NetWare print queue and log on and log off Every time you log on
   and log off again, you use up another connection.

   OR

 - Upon log off, if an application fails to close properly, you may receive an
   application error. When you log back on another connection is used.

NOTE: This problem can be reproduced with the NetWare 4.1 server in Bindery
Emulation Mode or with NetWare Directory Services (NDS) loaded.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - After logging back on, go back into Printman and remove the printer. The
   unreleased connection usually goes away.
