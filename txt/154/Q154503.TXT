SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Hurricane virtual memory manager (VMM) and you attempt to
remotely control a Systems Management Server client, the following error message
appears:

   WUSER2 caused a General Protection Fault in module IDIS_LM.DLL

CAUSE

Hurricane is a virtual memory manager that performs GDI object mapping in a
manner incompatible with the remote control functionality of Systems Management
Server.

WORKAROUND

To remove GDI Object Mapping, edit the Hurricane.ini file found in the Hurricane
directory and turn off GDIObjectMapping by adding the following entry:

   [Heap Expander]
   GDIObjectMapping=OFF
