TITLE   :Console Text Incorrectly Formatted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you return to a full-screen command window (either Cmd or Command) that
was forced to minimize, the text in the command window does not contain proper
formatting.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there is a large font selected for the command
prompt. When the ALT+ENTER message to return the window to full screen is
received by the window, it tries to switch from full-screen to windowed mode.

When it returns to full-screen mode, the console does not have correct
information about the window and font size and formats the text incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restore the window to windowed mode and then back to full screen by pressing
ALT+ENTER twice.
