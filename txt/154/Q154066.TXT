TITLE   :Removing Everyone(Read) from %WinRoot% Shuts Down at Logon
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbother kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When read access for the Everyone Group has been removed from the %WinRoot%
directory tree and read permissions have not been granted for the current user
or group attempting to logon, an automatic shutdown of the system is initiated.

This will occur if the current user is not a member of the Administrators
group(s) (either local or domain).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The system shutdown is caused by the inability to access the files necessary to
create the Win32 subsystem process in which Program Manager will run. Because
this process cannot be initiated, the system begins a shutdown.

To ensure that new users will be able to logon locally you will need to allow
read access to the %WinRoot% directory tree for the group the users will belong
to.

For further information on this problem, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
