PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Under Windows NT 3.51, Print Manager stops responding when you attempt to
connect to a shared network printer. This problem occurs when Print Manager is
building a browse list of available printers in your workgroup or domain.

Under Windows NT 4.0, the Add Printer wizard stops responding when you attempt to
perform the same operation as above.

CAUSE
=====

One or more of the shared printers in the workgroup or domain has a comment or
description that contains multiple comma characters in succession, such as
"Finance printer,,High Quality,2nd Floor".

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the printer description or comment to remove the multiple, successive
commas.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
