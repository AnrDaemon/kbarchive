TITLE   :BUG: C2374 in OLECTLID.H When Rebuilding DBDAO3.DLL for VC 4.2
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDAOsearchkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The DAO SDK, included with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When rebuilding the DAO SDK that ships with Visual C++ 4.2, you will receive
numerous C2374 errors compiling the DBDAO.CPP file:

   C:\MSDEV\INCLUDE\OLECTLID.H(17) : error C2374:
   '<Interface>' : redefinition; multiple initialization

where <Interface> is a number of OLE interfaces defined within OLECTLID.H.

CAUSE
=====

The \MSDEV\DAOSDK\SRC\STDAFX.H file that ships with the DAO SDK is incorrect.
When rebuilding the DAO SDK DLL's, DBDAO.CPP includes its own STDAFX.H, which
also includes AFXDISP.H and OLECTLID.H. However, AFXDISP.H has already included
OLECTLID.H, creating the redefinition.

NOTE: This issue only occurs when recompiling the DAO SDK, and not when using the
DAO SDK in a separate application. DBDAO.CPP is the only file that would include
\MSDEV\DAOSDK\SRC\STDAFX.H that has the multiple include in it.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the \MSDEV\DAOSDK\SRC\STDAFX.H file to remove the explicit reference to
OLECTLID.H. The final version of the file should look like this:

     // stdafx.h : include file for standard system include files,
      //  or project specific include files that are used frequently, but
      //      are changed infrequently
      // 
      #define INITGUID TRUE
      #include <afxdisp.h>        // MFC OLE automation classes
      #include <CGUID.H>

      #define DLLEXPORT   __declspec( dllexport )

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
