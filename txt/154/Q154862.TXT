TITLE   :Web Browsers May Fail When Accessing SSL Secure Pages
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Web Browsers that support Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) may fail when accessing
secure pages on an Internet Information Server (IIS) version 1.0 through a
firewall.

CAUSE
=====

Some firewalls packetize SSL differently for connections that occur through a
router. The firewalls' different behavior for remote connections results in
problems for SSL browser clients that are directly connected, but SSL browser
clients connected through a router fail.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in IIS version 1.0. This problem
was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For information
on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
