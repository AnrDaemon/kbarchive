TITLE   :How to Remove Jet<n>.log Files Created by DSMN

The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Directory Service Manager for NetWare (DSMN) periodically creates
Jet<n>.log files. These files are used for recovery if the service is
stopped abruptly or in an unusual way. If this happens, and the service is
restarted, the log files are automatically used to re-create the correct state
of the account synchronization database.

However, over time, these files may accumulate in the
%Systemroot%\System32\Syncagnt directory. This article explains how to remove
these files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The log files are processed and deleted whenever a full backup of the account
synchronization database occurs. Therefore, if many Jet<n>.log files have
accumulated in the %Systemroot%\System32\Syncagnt directory, you should schedule
daily backups to clear these logs.

You can also delete these log files manually, as long as the DSMN service is not
stopped incorrectly before the next full backup of the database.
