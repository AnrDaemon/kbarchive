SYMPTOMS
========

Placing a Windows Common Control's Toolbar on an MDI Parent form affects the
functionality of the Control Box on MDI Child windows under Windows NT 3.51.
Under normal circumstances, double-clicking a Control Box closes a window as if
the user had clicked once to drop down the menu and then selected "Close." When
the Toolbar is placed on a Parent window under Windows NT 3.51, double-clicking
the Control Box drops the menu but doesn't dismiss the window.

This problem does not occur with Visual Basic under Windows 2000, Windows NT
version 4.0, Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you add a PictureBox control to the Form, and Cut and Paste the Toolbar onto
the PictureBox, the problem is resolved. When you run the code after doing this,
the Control Box behaves in the expected manner.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
This problem was corrected in Windows 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Set the MDIChild property of Form1 to TRUE.

3. From the Insert menu, choose MDI Form.

4. Add a Toolbar Control to the MDI Form. No images or buttons are required to
   show the problem.

5. Press the F5 key to start the project.

6. Maximize the Child Window.

7. Double-click the Control Box of the Child Window. The menu should drop down,
   but the window is not dismissed.
