TITLE   :XADM: Options in Admin or User Manager May Be Overwritten
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

General settings changed in Exchange on the Options menu in User Manager for
Domains may be overwritten by the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.
Auto-naming rules and permissions settings changed in the Administrator program
in the Options dialog box under Tools may be overwritten by User Manager.

CAUSE
=====

Both Administrator and User Manager save settings on exiting regardless of
whether changes are made or not. This allows cached information in one of the
applications to overwrite changes that may have been made by the other.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
