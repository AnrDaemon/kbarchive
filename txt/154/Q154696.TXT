TITLE   :Starting MS-DOS from Office 95 Shortcut Bar May Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you start an MS-DOS prompt from the Microsoft Office shortcut bar, you may
receive the following error:

   <Office Path>\Shortc~1\Office\MS-DOS~1.pif Invalid program file name,
   please check your pif file

CAUSE
=====

The Cmd line for the MS-DOS prompt properties incorrectly points to where
<Winnt> is the directory where your Windows NT files reside.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Choose Properties on the MS-DOS icon on the Office shortcut bar.

2. Click the Program tab.

3. Change the Cmd line to Cmd.exe.

A Windows NT command window will now open when you click the MS-DOS button on the
Microsoft Office shortcut bar.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
