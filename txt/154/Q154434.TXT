======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Dial-Up Networking in Windows 95 to dial into a remote network, you
may receive the following error message when the remote Microsoft Windows NT
server attempts to validate you:

   No domain server was available to validate your logon.

After you receive this error message, the dial-up client may still be attached to
the network (but without authentication) and may have access to some resources
on the domain. In some cases, connectivity is not established at all.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs when the TCP/IP protocol (specifically, Vnbt.386) is
not completely bound to the redirector (Vredir) before the logon request occurs.
The DOMAINNAME<1ch> name query request is never sent to the WINS server;
therefore, the Windows 95 client never finds a domain controller that can
validate its logon.

The DOMAINNAME<1ch> request is normally sent by a TCP/IP client to locate
domain controllers on the network for the purpose of logging on to the domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95 and OEM
Service Release 1 (OSR1):
