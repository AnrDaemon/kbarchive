TITLE   :PRB: Including STL.H Causes Compiler Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.20
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Standard C++ Library, included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Programs that include "STL.H" generate different compiler errors, depending on
the STL template class you try to instantiate. The compiler errors are all in
STL header files. The sample code below illustrates some of these errors.

CAUSE
=====

STL.H contains typographical and syntax errors.

RESOLUTION
==========

STL.H was included with Visual C++ 4.2 by mistake. It is not part of the ANSI
standard for Standard C++ Libraries and should not be used. Instead, include the
individual header files associated with the particular STL component(s) the
program is using. The sample code below, for example, will compile and run
correctly if "#include <stl.h>" is changed to "#include <vector>."


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed:
   */ 

   //workaround: change the following line to #include <vector>
   #include <stl.h>

   //workaround: change the "typedef" to:
   //typedef vector<int, allocator<int> > INTVECT;
   typedef vector<int> INTVECT;

   void main()
   {
        INTVECT ivect;
   }
