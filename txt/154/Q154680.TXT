The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194259.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert an image or type text in a new typeface in FrontPage Editor, the
image or text jumps to a position much lower on the page than it should.

CAUSE
=====

One or more of the Times New Roman font files may be corrupt (these files are
located in the \Windows\Fonts folder).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, replace the Times New Roman font files in the
\Windows\Fonts folder that are not corrupt.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These font files contain equations that describe the various aspects of the font
such as baseline, ascender, descender, and so on. When some aspect of the file
is corrupt, FrontPage Editor may not interpret the size of the font correctly
(for example, it may appear that the font is much taller than it actually is);
therefore, any text of a different typeface or a bottom-aligned image may be
placed below this font because FrontPage Editor interprets the corrupt font as
being the tallest element on the current line.

Times New Roman is selected by Windows browsers to render the default Normal
style font of HTML documents.

Additional query words: type style
