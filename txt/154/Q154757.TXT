SUMMARY
=======

Remote Data Objects (RDO) provided with Visual Basic give the programmer the
ability to Requery an rdoResultset. The Requery method ensures that the
rdoResultset contains the most recent data or enables the user to return
different results for a prepared statement whose parameters have been changed.

The Online Help suggests checking the Restartable property to determine if the
rdoResultset supports requerying.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Online Documentation has the following advice:

   Check the Restartable property before using the Requery method on an
   rdoResultset. If the object's Restartable property is set to False, use
   the OpenResultset method on the underlying rdoPreparedStatement to re-
   execute the query.

   You can use the Requery method to update an rdoResultset object's
   underlying parameter query after the parameter values have been changed.
   If the rdoPreparedStatement does not contain parameters, the Restartable
   property is always True.

In practice, however, the Restartable property of an rdoResultset is always True
unless the Connection or the Statement handle is invalid. The Statement Handle
will be invalid after closing the rdoResultset.

This article does not apply to the Restartable property of a DAO Recordset.
