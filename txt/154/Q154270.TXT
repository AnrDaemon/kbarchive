TITLE   :Desktop Wallpaper Overruns Desktop
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change display resolutions, the desktop wallpaper may seem to have been
cut off, or the entire image may not seem to be displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you change to a lower resolution than when you
originally selected the wallpaper.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Run the Desktop Themes tool in Control panel and click Apply to reapply the
   wallpaper using the new resolution.

 - Enable the "Stretch desktop wallpaper to fit the screen" option on the Plus!
   tab in Display properties.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The wallpaper was applied at a different resolution than is currently in use.
For example, if you apply a wallpaper when the resolution is set to 800 x 600,
the theme switcher stretches the image to fit that resolution. If you then
change resolutions to 640 x 480, the image is too large for the current
resolution and seems to be cut off.
