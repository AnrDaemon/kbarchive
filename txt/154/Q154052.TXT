TITLE   :Explanation of X86 Boot Drive Limitations
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

During Setup, Windows NT can only be installed within the first 1,024 cylinders
of the boot drive. This is due to Interrupt 13 limitations on x86 computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When starting an x86 based computer, Ntdetect.com retrieves and stores Interrupt
13 information. This information is supplied by the computer's BIOS. Only
information for the first two disks in the system is saved. This information
about the drive layout is then passed to the operating system during
initialization. The amount of space that the operating system files can use to
boot the system is limited in Windows NT to the first 1,024 cylinders of disk 0.
This means that Ntldr, Boot.ini, Ntdetect.com and the Windows NT operating
system files must be within this boundary.

If the disk controller is using a 32 sector/64 head translation scheme, this
boundary will be 1 GB. If the controller uses 63 sector/255 head translation,
the limit will be 4 GB. If there is a secondary controller that does not have
BIOS enabled, Windows NT will default to 32 sectors/64 heads. In some cases,
such as duplexing, this may cause identical drives on different controllers to
be interpreted as being slightly different in size.
