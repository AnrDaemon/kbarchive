SYMPTOMS
========

Every 20 to 30 seconds, the mouse will behave erratically. Behaviors include
jumping from one side to the other as you move the mouse. Performance monitor
will indicate the computer is at 100% CPU usage during this time. In addition,
an event will be logged:

unattached. During this reinsertion attempt, it uses the CPU to a point where
the entire system appears to stop responding momentarily.

RESOLUTION
==========
