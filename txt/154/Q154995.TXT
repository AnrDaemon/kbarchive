-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to compress files located on a computer running Microsoft Windows
NT version 4.0 from a Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51 client, either server or
workstation, compression fails on each file with the following error message
from File Manager:

   Cannot change compression attribute.

Running the Compact utility returns the following error message:

   Access denied.

If you click Retry, the file will usually compress. However, the next file fails
to compress with the same error messages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is independent of other applications or users who might be
accessing the file. The problem does not occur between two Microsoft Windows NT
version 4.0 workstations.

RESOLUTION
==========

Perform "over the network" file compression functions from a Microsoft Windows
NT version 4.0 Workstation or Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
