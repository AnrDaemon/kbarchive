PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you clear the Allow New Users To Login check box, it will be checked again
the next time you restart File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW).

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. If Allow New Users To Login was not checked after a restart,
no one could log on.
