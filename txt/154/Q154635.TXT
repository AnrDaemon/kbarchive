TITLE   :FPNW Login.exe Does Not Set Machine Name Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Novell NetWare login scripts may contain a command called 'MACHINE NAME='. FPNW
supports this command; however, the syntax is 'MACHINE='. This command sets the
NetBIOS machine name of the computer; it is not an environmental variable.
Applications can query this value to determine the machine's name. Applications
that are designed to read the machine name that has been set from a NetWare
server using 'MACHINE NAME=' may not work with FPNW using 'MACHINE='.

CAUSE
=====

The value set by the 'MACHINE NAME=' command should be a NetBIOS name. NetBIOS
names are 16 bytes long, padded with spaces, and (in the MS-DOS environment)
zero terminated. The Novell Login.exe does not pad the name with spaces; the
FPNW Login.exe does. For example:

NetWare Login.exe
-----------------

   MACHINE NAME = "SERVER"       Value set to:  SERVER<end>

FPNW Login.exe
--------------

   MACHINE = "SERVER"         Value set to:  SERVER         <end>

RESOLUTION
==========

Although the FPNW Login.exe sets the NetBIOS name according to specification,
Microsoft has changed Login.exe to set the machine name in the same manner as
the NetWare Login.exe.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 with
File and Print Services for NetWare. This problem was corrected in the latest
Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
