The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

If you attempt to install a printer on a computer using Microsoft Windows NT
version 4.0, Setup may attempt to retrieve required driver files from a network
share instead of a local source.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you install Microsoft Windows NT Version 4.0 from a network share, the
registry will be updated with the installation path. Although attempts to
install other software components may seek a local device, the printer setup
will default to the installation path stored in the registry.

To change this path you must edit the registry value:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following registry value in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree:

   \Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\Installation Sources

3. Change the string to include the installation path to be used as the default.

4. Quit the Registry Editor.

NOTE: The following registry value

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\ 

      WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\SourcePath

refers to the default source for other installable software components. This
value may also be changed to a valid local path.
