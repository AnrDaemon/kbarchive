TITLE   :Power Management in Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Power management features such as Suspend are not available in Windows NT
version 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

By design, Windows NT version 4.0 lacks power management features.

STATUS
======

Microsoft plans to include this technology, which is currently available in
Windows 95, in a future release of Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most new portable computers support advanced power management (APM). Windows 95
fully supports APM version 1.1 and provides a visual indication of the system's
power status on the taskbar. Windows 95 includes power- management APIs that
make the information provided by APM 1.1 available to programs. Programs can
help conserve a portable PC's batteries by turning off disk-intensive background
operations and making other adjustments to maximize battery life. Windows 95
makes built-in power-management hardware easier to use by supplementing external
"Suspend" buttons with a command on the Start menu, and by powering down and
resetting peripheral devices as part of the suspend cycle.
