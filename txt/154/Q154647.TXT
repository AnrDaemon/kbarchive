TITLE   :Setup Halts with "Windows Has Disabled Direct Disk Access"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Windows NT Workstation or Server version 4.0 from a flat
directory on the hard disk, Setup may halt with the following message after
setting the location of the source files:

   Windows has disabled direct disk access to protect your long file
   names. To override this protection, see the Lock /? Command for more
   information. The system has been halted. Press CTRL-ALT-DEL to restart
   your computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98
system files have been installed on the hard disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restart the computer, and then type "lock c:" (without quotation marks) at the
command prompt. Windows returns the following message:

   WARNING: The lock command enables direct disk access by programs that can
   CORRUPT file names and/or DESTROY disk data, resulting in the loss of files
   on your disk.

   Are you sure (Y/N)?

Press Y to return to the command prompt, and then run Windows NT Setup again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95/98 includes volume-locking code to protect long file names from
programs that make absolute INT25 read and INT26 write disk calls by- passing
the FAT. The Windows 95/98 Command.com includes a LOCK command to allow you to
perform an exclusive read/write lock for use with programs that do not use the
volume-locking APIs included in Windows 95/98.
