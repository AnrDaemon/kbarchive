TITLE   :Unable to View Unshared Printer in Windows NT 4.0 Printer Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51, the Server view in Print Manager shows all
printers on a server, even those that are not shared, to all remote users. In
Windows NT 4.0, when a remote user is not an administrator or print operator of
a server, the printer's folder will not show any unshared printers.

CAUSE
=====

This is a design decision that was made when changing the user interface to the
new shell.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, you can share the printer with a share name ending
in a dollar sign ($). This will make the print share visible from Windows NT
clients only.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows NT 4.0, when you are not an administrator of the print server, but
you have full control of an unshared printer, you cannot see the printer to
administer it. In Windows NT 3.51, you can see the printer in Print Manager even
though it is not shared, and you could manage print jobs and configure the
printer.
