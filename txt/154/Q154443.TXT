======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run the Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard to migrate MS Mail
accounts, you might receive the following error:

   event id= 283 source=ms exchange migds
   Changes could not be written to the Directory object. Try connecting to an
   Exchange Server in the same Site as this object.

This can be caused by either insufficient rights to the Microsoft Exchange
Directory, or a mailbox or custom recipient that already exists on the Microsoft
Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Microsoft Exchange Server has been set up for Directory Synchronization
with the MS Mail Postoffice, there will already be an object for the MS Mail
user. To migrate these users, perform the following steps:

1. Log into the domain using the Microsoft Exchange Service Account or an
   account that has administrative permissions for the Microsoft Exchange
   Server.

2. Use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program to remove the custom
   recipient or mailbox object for the user that you are trying to migrate from
   the Global Address List and recipients container.

3. Run a Knowledge Consistency Check on the Microsoft Exchange Directory.

4. Rerun the Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard.
