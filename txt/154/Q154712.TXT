MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition, the BusLogic BT-946c adapter is not currently included on the
Hardware Compatibility List for RISC platforms. BusLogic currently builds its
adapter configuration tools into the adapter's firmware, which cannot be
accessed on RISC platforms (DEC Alpha, MIPS, PowerPC). Adapters that cannot be
configured while installed in a RISC platform are not certified for Windows NT
as being compatible with that platform.
