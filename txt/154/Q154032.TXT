-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you restore an offline store from a Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 computer,
with or without Microsoft Exchange Server Service Pack 1 (SP1) installed, onto a
Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 computer with Microsoft Exchange Service Pack 2
(SP2) installed, you will receive the following error:

   1087 The information store was restored from an offline backup. Run ISINTEG
   -patch before starting the information store.

   1005 Unable to start the Microsoft Exchange Information store. Error 1011

When you run ISINTEG -patch, you will receive an EcBadVersion error.

If the store was recovered from an online backup, the following events will be
logged:

   Unable to recover the database because error 0x00000451 occurred after a
   restore operation.

   Unable to initialize the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service. Error
   1105.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is because a new version of Mdbrest.dll was provided with SP2. To
workaround this problem, follow these steps:

1. Rename Mdbrest.dll in the Exchsrvr\bin directory to Mdbrest.new.

2. Copy Mdbrest.dll from a Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 with or without
   SP1 (there was no change to this file in SP1) to the Exchsrvr\bin directory.

3. If the store was recovered from an off-line backup you must run ISINTEG
   -PATCH. This will update the store.

4. Delete Mdbrest.dll and rename Mdbrest.new to Mdbrest.dll.

5. Start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store.
