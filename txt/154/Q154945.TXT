TITLE   :FlushFileBuffers Not Committing Filesize Properly in NT3.51 SP4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If your system crashes immediately after you do a FlushFileBuffers() on a file
located on an Windows NT file system (NTFS) partition, upon rebooting, the
filesize for that file may be reported as 0 bytes.

This is only a problem in Windows NT 3.51 with Service Pack 4 Build 1057.

CAUSE
=====

When you do a Flush Buffers on a file, the data is actually written to disk, and
the Filesize (and ValidDataLength) is effectively flushed to a logfile. This
logfile is not properly committed to disk causing an incorrect filesize to be
reported when doing a dir.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
