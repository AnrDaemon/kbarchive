SUMMARY
=======

After installing PowerChute Plus version 4.2.x or PowerChute for Windows NT,
PowerChute may be unable to communicate with the uninterruptable power supply
(UPS). This article documents procedures for troubleshooting PowerChute
installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To troubleshoot communications problems between PowerChute and the UPS, do the
following:

1. Ensure that the UPS service has been started. You can check this in Control
   Panel Services.

2. Ensure that the PowerChute cable is properly and fully connected to both the
   UPS interface port and the appropriate Windows NT serial port.

3. The baud rate on the Windows NT serial port must be set to 2400. You can
   check this in Control Panel Ports.

4. Perform a terminal emulation test by doing the following:

   a. Stop the UPS service. To do this, open Control Panel Services, select UPS,
      and click Stop.

   b. Double-click the Terminal icon in the Accessories group.

   c. On the Settings menu, click Communications. The desired serial port should
      be set to the following:

         Baud rate     2400
         Stop bits     1
         Parity        none
         Flow control  Xon/Xoff

   d. Click OK.

   e. At the flashing cursor prompt, type an uppercase Y. The computer should
      return the uppercase letters SM.

   f. If nothing is returned to the screen when you complete step e, move the
      interface cable to another available serial port on the Windows NT system
      and perform step e again.

   g. If still nothing is returned when you complete step f, test the
      questionable COM port with another communications device such as a modem,
      or perform a loopback test with an appropriate software package. If an SM
      is returned, go to step h.

   h. Quit Terminal, but do not save any settings.

   i. Restart the UPS service.
