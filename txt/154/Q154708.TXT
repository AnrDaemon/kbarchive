TITLE   :XCLN: Inbox Rules Cannot be Modified on Macintosh Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft Exchange client for Macintosh Inbox rule cannot be modified because
the Edit Rule button is grayed out. This only occurs when an Alert Inbox rule
has been created using a Microsoft Exchange client for Windows. This is by
product design.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Delete all rules with Alerts from the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows.
   You can do this by clicking Inbox Assistant on the Tools menu, highlighting
   the rule with the Alert, and clicking Delete Rule.

2. Re-create your rules using the Microsoft Exchange client for Macintosh.

NOTE: This workaround does not apply for sound rules.
