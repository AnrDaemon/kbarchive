SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document to a file, data may be sent as text instead of
graphical format.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is known to occur with Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4 and 4M
printer drivers when both of the following conditions exist:

 - The Print TrueType As Graphics option is enabled on the Fonts tab in the
   printer's properties.

 - The Use Raster Graphics option is enabled on the Graphics tab in the
   printer's properties.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use vector graphics instead of raster graphics. To
do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the printer you want to modify, and then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

3. Click the Graphics tab.

4. Click Use Vector Graphics, and then click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that this problem occurs only when you redirect print output to a file. The
problem does not occur when you print to the printer.
