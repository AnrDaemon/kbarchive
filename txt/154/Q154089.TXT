TITLE   :XCLN: Cannot Send Sealed Message when Offline
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the key management features while you are offline, the
following error message is displayed:

   The client operation failed. The recipients could not be validated.

CAUSE
=====

The key management component does not support working offline.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use the key management features, you must log on to the Microsoft Exchange
Server computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you attempt to send a sealed message, the Microsoft Exchange Client obtains
the recipient's public sealing key from the directory service and uses that key
to encrypt the first encryption key. That information is then sent to the
information store to be delivered. If you are working offline, the directory
service and information store are not available.
