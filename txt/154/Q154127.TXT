 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to change the font in HyperTerminal, there may be only one font
available to select (the Courier New TrueType font).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you upgraded a previous version of Windows in which
the Show Only TrueType Fonts In Applications option was enabled to Windows 95.
This setting is replicated in Windows 95 during the upgrade process.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Fonts.

2. On the View menu, click Options.

3. Click the TrueType tab.

4. Click the "Show only TrueType fonts in the programs on my computer" check box
   to clear it.

5. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.

After you follow these steps, the following fonts should be available in
HyperTerminal:

 - Courier

 - Courier New

 - Fixedsys

 - Terminal
