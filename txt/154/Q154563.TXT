TITLE   :FPNW: Search Drive Vector Not Set
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to run an application that relies on the search drive vector
being set, it will not work correctly because the search drive vector is not
set.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft LOGIN.EXE program fails to set the shell's search drive vector.
The search drive vector is used in conjunction with various levels of search
mode (as set by the SMODE value) to provide enhanced file search capabilities
(over and above the normal search for executable files along the MS-DOS search
path). For example, the shell's search mode can be set to a value that directs
the shell to search for data files along the search path specified by the search
drive vector. Of course, if the search drive vector is not set (as is the case
with the Microsoft LOGIN program), such searches performed by the shell will
fail.

The search drive vector is a 17-byte field internal to the NETX shell. Each of
the first 16 bytes contains the ordinal number of a drive letter (0xFF indicates
the end of the vector) and the last byte is always set to 0xFF. Normally, the
login program will set this vector to equal all the network drives that have
been added to the path (by MAP INS). The SetSearchDriveVector API is Int 0x21,
Function 0xE9, SubFunction 0x02.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the fix referenced below. Login.exe, Logout.exe, and Map.exe have been
modified to correctly set the search drive vector.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for
NetWare version 3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
