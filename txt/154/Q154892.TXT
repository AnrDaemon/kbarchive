SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to disconnect from a Dial-Up Networking (DUN)
connection using the keyboard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the retail version of Windows 95, an icon appears on the taskbar when a DUN
connection is active. Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) does not display a
taskbar icon for an active DUN connection. Therefore, the only reference to an
active DUN connection appears in the system tray on the taskbar, which can be
accessed only by using the mouse. To quit an active DUN connection using the
keyboard, follow these steps:

1. Press CTRL+ESC to open the Start menu.

2. Press UP ARROW until Programs is selected, press RIGHT ARROW, and then use
   the ARROW keys to select Accessories.

3. Press RIGHT ARROW, press DOWN ARROW until Dial-Up Networking is selected, and
   then press ENTER.

4. In the Dial-Up Networking window, use the ARROW keys to select the currently
   active DUN connection, and then press ENTER.

5. In the dialog box for the active DUN connection, press DOWN ARROW until
   Disconnect is selected, and then press ENTER.
