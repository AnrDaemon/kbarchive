TITLE   :Err Msg: The LsaCreateSecret Call Failed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Error 1057 is reported when you select the startup option Log On As This Account
for a Windows NT Service.

The following is written to the system log:

   Event ID#: 7005
   The LsaCreateSecret call failed with the following error: C0000035

CAUSE
=====

You can manage trusted domains and associated passwords programmatically by
using the Windows NT local security authority (LSA) API. However, LSA secrets
are limited to 256. The client side of a trust relationship consumes one LSA
secret. LSA secrets are used for other purposes (most notably, trust
relationships and for saving service passwords). As a result, LSA API in your
program or service may fail because you have reached the 256 limit.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the updated Lsasrv.dll file.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
