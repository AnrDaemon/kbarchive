When you use a two form application (send form and response form) created in
Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer, the subject line on the response
form cannot be set to its initial value when you compose a response to the send
form.

MORE INFORMATION

If the following conditions are met, when a response to the send form is
created, the initial value set for the response will not be used:

1. The subject line for the response form must be configured with an initial
   value for the MAPI_Subject field.

2. The send form is set to use the response form as the Item Type to be Used for
   the Reply Event.

3. The Initialize New Items When Created option is selected.

The subject line will be blank or the subject line will contain a "RE:" and the
text from the subject line of the send form.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
