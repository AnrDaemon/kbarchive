TITLE   :Windows 95 Does Not Retain Primary WINS Server IP Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork msnets win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you restart your computer, the WINS Server setting may not be retained.
This setting is located on the WINS Configuration tab in the properties for the
TCP/IP protocol.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 requires both the primary and secondary entries for the WINS Server
setting. If you enter only the primary WINS server's IP address, the setting is
not retained.

RESOLUTION
==========

If there is only one WINS server for the network, enter the IP address for the
server in both the primary and secondary WINS Server setting boxes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
