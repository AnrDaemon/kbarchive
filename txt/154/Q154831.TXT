TITLE   :Arcinst Not Available for PPC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT for the PowerPC on a system without a valid system
partition, you will receive the following message:

   No valid system partitions are defined on this computer, or all system
   partitions are full. Windows NT requires 750 kilobytes (1 KB = 1024) of free
   disk space on a valid system partition.

   A system partition is an area of a hard disk that your computers uses to store
   operating system startup files and diagnostic, configuration, or other
   manufacturer-supplied programs.

   System partitions are created and managed by a manufacturer-supplied
   configuration program. If you do not know of such a program, you can use a
   program called ARCINST.EXE, which is supplied on the Windows NT CD- ROM.

   How you invoke this program depends on your computer type. Typically you
   select a "Run a program" option from your computer's startup menu.

   Setup cannot continue. Press F3 to exit.

When you try to run ARCINST in the manner suggested, you will receive the
following message:

   Error: The file or device does not exist, press any key to continue

CAUSE
=====

Unlike on the MIPS and ALPHA platforms, this program does not exist in the PPC
directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

The Motorola Power Stack computers come with this program on a disk. If this
program is not available, the manufacturer should be contacted for a copy.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
