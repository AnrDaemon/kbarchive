TITLE   :PRB: Visual SourceSafe Status Truncates Filenames to 20 Char
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Visual SourceSafe Command line command "SS Status" to determine the
checkout status of files only returns the first 20 characters of the filename.

CAUSE
=====

The SS Status Command line returns information in a columnar format. Because of
the columns for Filename, User name, Date/Time, and checkout directory, there is
a limit of 20 characters for the filename. When working with files that have
long filenames greater than 20 characters, the filenames are truncated at the
20th character.

RESOLUTION
==========

An alternative is to use the short filename mode that displays the long filename
using MS-DOS 8.3 filename conventions such as SS Status -NS. Although the 16-bit
version of the Visual SourceSafe Explorer allows the use of long file names, the
16-bit Command line does not.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Be aware that Visual SourceSafe does not use the same method for converting long
filenames as Windows 95 or Windows NT, so the converted Short filename as
supplied by Visual SourceSafe may not match the filenames in the working
directory exactly.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. In a project ($/TEST), place a file with the name "New Text Document.txt,"
   and check the file out.

2. From the Visual SourceSafe MS-DOS directory Command line, issue the following
   command:

   "ss status $/TEST"

3. The filename of the SS STATUS should be: NEW_TE~1.TXT.

4. From the MS-DOS prompt, perform a directory (dir) of the working directory
   (or the directory where the file was checked out). The resultant filename
   should be "NEWTEX~1 TXT" (Win95 or WinNT).
