TITLE   :HALMCA Does Not Check got PCI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience a performance problem on computers with PCI architecture.

CAUSE
=====

The hardware abstraction layer (HAL) is treating PCI transfers like ISA
transfers. Transfers that use buffers greater than 16MB are mapped into HAL
buffers and the PCI transfer size limits are incorrectly set to ISA limits
(limited to the HAL buffer size, which is typically 64K). The HalGetAdapter
routine in the HALMCA does not check for PCI.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the fix referenced below. This fix to the HALMCA.DLL adds the condition
to check for the PCI.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
