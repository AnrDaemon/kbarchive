TITLE   :XCLN: Multiple Move Rules Duplicate Messages in a PST File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the delivery location is set to a personal folder(PST)inbox and a single
message matches the criteria for two or more different rules that move the mail
to the same PST folder; the MOVETO action will create a duplicate of the message
in the PST folder being moved to.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the delivery location to the server store inbox. Only one copy of a message
will be moved regardless of how many rules point it to the same folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Inconsistent results are achieved depending on the location of the MOVETO folder
and the default delivery location of inbound mail. If the MOVETO action is for a
server store folder, one copy of the message will be moved. If the MOVETO action
is to a local PST store folder, two copies of the message will be moved. This
only happens when initial delivery is set to a PST inbox. If the delivery
location is set to the server store inbox, only one copy of a message will be
moved regardless of how many rules point it to the same folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
