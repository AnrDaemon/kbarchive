TITLE   :Update.exe in 3.51 Service Packs May Use Wrong Patchdll.dll
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Service Pack executable file Update.exe calls Patchdll.dll, and if one
exists in the path, it will use that one. This may cause Update to terminate
with the following error message:

   An error has occurred. Invalid library procedure: <library procedure>

where <library procedure> is a specific library procedure name. The
procedure name differs each time you run Update.exe.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if Patchdll.dll is in your path. Patchdll.dll is used during
the Service Pack upgrade, but it is removed after the upgrade. The Windows NT
3.51 Service Pack upgrade does not place the file in your path.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, remove Patchdll.dll from your path.

To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT
service pack. The fix is that Update.exe now loads Patchdll.dll from the
directory in which Update.inf is found.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
