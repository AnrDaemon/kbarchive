The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.0, 7.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Seven Habits Help Topics state that to print anything you see in the Seven
Habits Tools or Seven Habits Tab, and you can select Covey Paper from the Print
dialog box. This is incorrect, you cannot print this information without
additional software from Covey Leadership Center.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The help file states:

   Anything you see in the Seven Habits Tools or in the Seven Habits Tab can be
   printed by selecting the File menu, Print in Schedule+. Select the Covey
   Paper Format you wish to use and then specify what information you want
   printed. Schedule+ prints to all four of Covey Leadership Center's planner
   sizes.

This is incorrect. The capability to print the information on these tabs is
available only with the Covey Seven Habits Tools Add-On which will add three
more tabs to the Seven Habits Tools dialog. One of these tabs is the Print tab.


If you are interested in receiving more information about the Seven Habits Tools
Add-On, please call the Covey Leadership Center at 1-800-304-9799.

If you wish to print the information contained within the Mission or Roles tabs,
select the text, copy it, and then paste it into a word processor or Notepad.
