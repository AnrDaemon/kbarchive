TITLE   :Non-System Disk or Disk Error on Remote Boot Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a remote boot workstation attempts to boot using the boot block from the
remote boot server, the following error may occur on the workstation:

   Non-System Disk or Disk Error.

CAUSE
=====

When a remote boot server prepares the boot block for the workstation, it
gathers the component files needed for the workstation to boot and have
connectivity with the network. If some of the required MS-DOS boot files are
missing or inaccessible, the "non-system disk or disk error" message may occur.
The same message may be observed when you attempt to boot from an MS-DOS
formatted floppy disk that does not contain the Msdos.sys or Io.sys files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure of the following:

1. Make sure that the share \\<Server>\Rplfiles exists and contains the
   Msdos.sys and Io.sys files.

2. Make sure that the Msdos.sys and Io.sys files do not have any access
   restrictions on them. On an MS-DOS disk, these files would normally have the
   read-only, system, and hidden attributes. The procedure for copying these
   files, as stated in the Microsoft Windows NT Installation Guide, removes
   these attributes before copying and does not restore them to the files that
   exist in the \\<Server>\Rplfiles share. Any restrictions on these files
   will prevent their inclusion in the boot block.

3. If you copied MS-DOS files from an operating system other than MS-DOS, you
   may need to rename them to Msdos.sys and Io.sys respectively.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on remote boot, please consult the Microsoft Windows NT
Installation Guide.
