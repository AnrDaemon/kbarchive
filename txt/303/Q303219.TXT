TITLE   :Incorrect Buddy Name Exposed When Using Inspect With MSN Explore
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

With a Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) enabled screen reader running, you
start MSN Explorer. You click the Online Buddies icon. You select a buddy from
the list, and then the Online Buddies Instant Message window appears. If your
screen reader supports reading of the Status bar, you press the keyboard
sequence that will read this information. Or you have your screen reader read
the entire window. Your screen reader will not read the Buddy name, alias, and
online status visible in the Status bar--you will only hear the title of the
window.

CAUSE
=====

This Status bar is currently owner drawn and does not support the standards that
allow the information to be exposed through MSAA.

RESOLUTION
==========

Some screen readers are able to provide this information through "non- MSAA
mode". If your screen reader supports this, try the keyboard sequence again. If
your screen reader is still unable to read the Status bar, you can get this
information in other places within MSN Explorer.
