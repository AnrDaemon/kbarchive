TITLE   :XADM: Command Line Directory Export Does Not Succeed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to perform a directory export with the Command Line Directory
Export Utility by using a directory export options file, the export might not
succeed. The result is a .csv file that contains only header information. The
.csv file contains an entry similar to the following:

Container,,,,,Recipients,,,,,,,

CAUSE
=====

The objects to be exported are located in a subcontainer. In the directory
export options file, the attribute BasepointOnly= was added. The BasepointOnly=
attribute was either set to "Yes" or left blank.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the value for the attribute BasepointOnly to "No" to make sure that the
objects in the subcontainer will be exported. You can also delete the whole
attribute in the export options file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the objects to be exported are located in a subcontainer, you must
specify a value in the export options file for the attribute "Basepoint" in the
following form:
BasePoint=/o=<Your Org Name>/ou=<Your Site Name>/cn=Recipients
You must also specify a value for the attribute "Container" in the following
form:
Container=<Your subcontainer Name>

Additionally, you must specify the value for the attribute "BasepointOnly."

If this value is set to "Yes," the content of the subcontainer is not accessed
during the export process. Instead, the basepoint itself is exported, which in
this case is the recipient container. As a result, you get a .csv file as
described in the "Symptoms" section of this article.

NOTE: The Help file states that the default value for BasepointOnly is "No." This
is not true. The default value is "Yes." Therefore, even if you leave the value
blank, the problem described in the "Symptoms" section of this article will
occur.
