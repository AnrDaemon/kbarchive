TITLE   :BUG: cPath Parameter Not Passed to DBC_Before/AfterDropOffline
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbOOP kbvfp KbDBFDBC kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbvfp700

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Only one parameter (cViewName) is sent to the DBC_BeforeDropOffline and
DBC_AfterDropOffline events although the Help topics for these events describe
the second parameter (cpath).

CAUSE
=====

The documentation for the DBC_BeforeDropOffline and DBC_AfterDropOffline events
incorrectly states that two parameters are passed to these two events. Actually,
only the first parameter is passed to the event. Also, note that the prototype
for these functions created by the Database Designer Properties dialog box is
incorrect. The prototype created by the Database Designer has a LPARAMETERS
statement that includes the second cPath parameter.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use the second (cpath) parameter.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
