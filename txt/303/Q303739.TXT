The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4, 1.99 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If your computer resides behind a firewall, you must take steps to ensure that
your Network Map (Partner.xml) is updated regularly and successfully. The steps
that you take depend on which version of the Passport Software Development Kit
(SDK) you are using.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using Passport SDK version 1.4.1 or later, first make sure that the
Passport SDK is installed. For more information about installing the Passport
SDK, see the following Passport SDK Web site:

   Installing the SDK
   http://www.passport.com/devinfo/setup_sdk.asp

After the Passport SDK is installed, adjust your registry so that your proxy
settings are available to the system process that obtains Partner.xml. To do
this, copy the contents of the following registry key

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ Internet
   Settings

to the following key:

   HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ Internet
   Settings

If you are using Passport SDK version 1.4 or earlier, you can add a Network Map
refresh page to your site. To create a Network Map refresh page, use the
following code:

   <% Dim pmadmin, success

   Set pmadmin = Server.CreateObject("Passport.Admin.1")
   success = pmadmin.Refresh(true)

   %>
   <HTML>
   <HEAD>
   <TITLE>Client Test Pages<%=strPageHeading%></TITLE>
   </HEAD>
   <BODY border=0 topmargin=0 rightmargin=0 leftmargin=0
   text="<%=strPgeTextCol%>" bgcolor="<%=strPgeBackCol%>">

   <%
   Response.write("Refresh occurred? ")
   Response.write(success)
   %>

   </FORM>
   </BODY>
   </HTML>
