   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your Windows NT-based computer, you may receive the following
error message:

   TRAP 0000000E ============ PAGE FAULT =============

   ** at linear address 00000002

   tr=0028 cr0=80000011 cr2=00000002 cr3=00300000

Note that the register values you receive may vary.

CAUSE
=====

This issue may occur if one of the following conditions is true:

 - The System registry hive is damaged.

 - The Boot.ini file contains invalid characters or incorrect settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods.

Method 1
--------

If your computer can boot off of a CD-ROM, start your computer with the Windows
NT 4.0 CD-ROM, click Repair, and then click Inspect registry files. If you have
an updated Emergency Repair Disk (ERD), choose the option to use the ERD for
repairs. If you do not have an updated ERD, choose the If you do not have the
Emergency Repair Disk, press ESC option, and then choose to repair the SYSTEM
registry file.

Method 2
--------

Replace the System hive in the Config folder with the SYSTEM._ hive from the
Repair folder. If you are using NTFS, start your computer from a Windows 2000
CD-ROM or Startup disk into the Recovery Console, and then copy the System hive
file (SYSTEM) from the %SYSTEMROOT%\Repair folder to the
%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\Config folder. If you are using the FAT file system, use a
Microsoft Windows 98 Startup disk to copy the System hive.

IMPORTANT: The %SYSTEMROOT%\Repair folder contains a compressed copy of the
System hive in the SYSTEM._ file. Expand and then rename the file to SYSTEM
prior to using it. Note that this System hive is only updated if RDISK is run
and the Update repair information option is chosen. If this is the case, use
"Method 3".

Method 3
--------

If the %SYSTEMROOT%\Repair\System._ file is old and RDISK has not been run to
update repair information, copy the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\System.Alt file
(to create a backup), and then rename this file to
%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\System.

Method 4
--------

If the preceding methods do not resolve the issue, create a parallel installation
of Windows NT 4.0, and then restore the System hive from a tape backup to the
original %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\Config folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

If one of the first three methods in the "Resolution" section of this article
resolves the issue, you can verify if the original System hive is actually
damaged. To do so, run Regedt32.exe, and try to open the original System hive by
using the Load hive command on the Registry menu. If you receive a message that
the file is not a valid registry file, this confirms that the System hive you
replaced was damaged.
