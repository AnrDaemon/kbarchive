KEYWORDS:kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Links 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Microsoft Links 2001 Update v1.21, the cameras may not
work as expected when you play Links 2001. One or more of the following
behaviors may occur:

 - You are unable to resize the camera view windows.

 - You are unable to move the camera view windows.

 - You are unable to close the camera view windows.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both your Microsoft Windows and your Links 2001
screen resolutions are set to 800 by 600 pixels.

NOTE: This behavior does not occur when both Windows and Links 2001 use the same
resolution setting other than 800 by 600. For example, this behavior does not
occur when both Windows and Links 2001 use a screen resolution setting of 1024
by 768 pixels.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Make Adjustments in Windowed Mode
-------------------------------------------

1. With Links running, press ALT+ENTER to put Links 2001 in windowed mode.

2. Move the frozen window or camera view, or close it.

3. Press ALT+ENTER again to return Links 2001 to full-screen mode.

Method 2: Change Windows Screen Resolution
------------------------------------------

If you want to play Links 2001 and use a screen resolution setting of 800 by 600
pixels, change the Windows resolution setting to something other than 800 by
600. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Quit all running programs.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. In Control Panel, double-click Display.

4. In the Display Properties dialog box, click the Settings tab.

5. Under "Screen area", drag the slider to a setting other than "800 by 600
   pixels". For example, select "1024 by 768 pixels".

6. Click OK, and then click OK on the Display Properties message that appears.

7. On the "You resized your desktop. Do you want to keep this setting?" message
   that appears, if the desktop is displayed correctly, click Yes.

   NOTE: If the desktop is not displayed correctly, your monitor may be unable to
   display the selected screen resolution. In this case, click No, and then
   select a different resolution setting.

Method 3: Change Links 2001 Screen Resolution
---------------------------------------------

If Windows is configured with the resolution setting of 800 by 600 pixels, change
the Links 2001 resolution setting to something other than 800 by 600. To do
this, follow these steps:

1. Start Links 2001.

2. On the Links 2001 menu screen that appears, click Options.

3. On the Options screen, click Graphic Settings.

4. On the Graphic Settings tab, click a setting other than "800 by 600" under
   Display Mode, and then click OK.

   You receive the following message:

   You have changed your video mode. Links will now
   restart with the new mode. Do you want to
   continue?

5. Click Yes, and then click OK to keep the display settings.

6. Click Back to return to the main menu.
