TITLE   :Security Update MS00-024 Breaks SHGetFolderPath in Shfolder.dll
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbtool kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix kbIE550preSP2fix kbIE550SP2Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the security update that is referred to in Q259496 (MS00-024),
the SHGetFolderPath function in Shfolder.dll may not work correctly, and it may
generate "access denied" error messages when it is called by an account that is
not a member of the administrators group.

CAUSE
=====

Because of changes that are made by the security patch, the SHGetFolderPath
function does not work when it makes an Open/Write call to a key in the
registry. Because the function was unable to access this key by using write
access, an "access denied" error message is generated. When this happens, some
third-party programs may stop working.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 or Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or 6.0 service
pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

Service Pack 6a.


STATUS

MORE INFORMATION

generated.
