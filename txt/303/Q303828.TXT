TITLE   :BUG: Installing MSDN Does Not Enable MDSN Help Bars in VFP 7.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMiscTools kbvfp kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbvfp700fix kbvfp700

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Visual FoxPro (VFP) version 7.0 and the Microsoft Developer
Network (MSDN) library, two items are not enabled on the Help menu:

 - MSDN Search

 - Technical Support

CAUSE
=====

The MSDN Search and Technical Support items are enabled only if MSDN is
installed. However, the version of MSDN that is included with Visual FoxPro is
the standard quarterly subscription release, which does not include a critical
file (Vshelp.dll) that is required to enable functionality of the MSDN Search
menu option.

NOTE: MSDN is required for Help with ActiveX controls that ship with Visual
FoxPro.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update is available from the following MSDN Web site:

   Visual FoxPro product updates
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/vfoxpro/downloads/updates.asp

NOTE: This issue only applies to the development version of Visual FoxPro and
does not affect the Visual FoxPro run-time libraries. If you have previously
installed Visual FoxPro 6.0 or Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 along with the MSDN
Help that shipped with those products, you do not have to install an update.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install VFP 7.0.

2. Install the MSDN library that ships with VFP 7.0.

3. View the Help menu. Note that two items are still disabled.
