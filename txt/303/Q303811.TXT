TITLE   :DNS Server Routes Queries to Root Name Servers and Forwarders
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2000,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a primary Intranet DNS server is configured to forward queries, it cannot
resolve to the Internet service provider's (ISP) DNS server. A network capture
may show the DNS server routing queries that it cannot resolve directly to the
Internet instead of routing them only to the Forwarder.

CAUSE
=====

In a standard DNS forwarder configuration, queries to the primary DNS server are
handled in the following way:

 - When the primary Intranet DNS server receives a query that it cannot resolve,
   it routes the query to the Forwarder.

 - If the primary DNS server does not receive a response in a timely fashion
   from the Forwarder, it then attempts to route the query to the Internet Root
   Domain Name servers.

The difference between the queries is that the queries to the Forwarder are
recursive and the primary DNS server queries are not.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent Root Hint Servers from being queried, either configure the primary
DNS server to be a slave forwarder (disable recursion) or delete the Root Name
server entries.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
