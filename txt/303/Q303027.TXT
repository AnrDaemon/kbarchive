Microsoft Windows may stop responding (hang) when the Age of Empires II THE AGE
OF KINGS Loading screen appears.

This behavior can occur if Direct Memory Access (DMA) is enabled for your

device.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click System.

3. In the System Properties dialog box, click the "View devices by type" option
   on the Device Manager tab.

4. Expand CDROM, click the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive that you want, and then click
   Properties.

5. In the "<drive name> Properties" dialog box, click to clear the DMA
   check box on the Settings tab, click OK, and then click Close.
