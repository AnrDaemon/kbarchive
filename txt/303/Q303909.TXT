data\multiplayer\insignia folder.

Issue 4

   applications may be denied.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System, and then click the Advanced tab.

3. Click Performance Options, and then click Change under Virtual Memory.

4. Under "Paging File Size for Selected Drive", change the initial size to 250
   MB, change the maximum size to 500 MB, and then click Set.

Issue 5

Direct3D functionality is not restored.

resolve this issue, start NetMeeting 3.01, and then quit it properly.

Issue 7

Antivirus before you start the game.
