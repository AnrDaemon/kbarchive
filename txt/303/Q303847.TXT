TITLE   :User Group Discovery  Collection Is Not Populated to Child Sites
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbConfig kbMMC kbServer kbsms200 kbCollections kbDiscovery kbsmsAdmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a new collection that is based on User and/or User Group
Discovery account information on a site that is the parent of one or more child
sites, the collection may not be populated correctly on the child sites. You may
observe that the collection is created at a child primary site, but the
collection may not have any members.

Also, you may receive the following status messages for a secondary site in the
Collection Evaluator component:

   Status Message ID 2519
   SMS Collection Evaluator failed to enumerate members of collection
   <CollID> at site <SecondarySiteCode>.

   Status Message ID 2512
   SMS Collection Evaluator failed to replicate collection <CollID> to
   child sites.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when child sites do not have the User and/or User Group
Discovery methods enabled.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, enable the User and/or User Group Discovery
methods at the child primary site (or sites).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If either the User or User Group Discovery methods have been previously enabled
on the child site, the collections can be evaluated, but they may contain
inaccurate membership information.

Status messages are not displayed at a child primary site to indicate a warning
or error condition.
