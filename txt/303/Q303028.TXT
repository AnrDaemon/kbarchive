-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.2 SP1 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Exchange LDAP MA to apply modifications, some transactions may
generate an "Invalid modification response 20" error message, even though you
can successfully make the same modifications through the Exchange Administration
tool. This behavior may occur during an InterOrg synchronization with Microsoft
Metadirectory Services (MMS).

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur after you initially add the custom recipients. On a
subsequent pass containing modifications, some records will generate this error.
Examination of the data reveals that the error occurs on those records where
either the primary SMTP reply or an SMTP proxy address have changed places.

Consider the following custom recipient example, where SMTP denotes the primary
reply address, and SMTP indicates a proxy address:

   SMTP: John.Doe@company.com
   smtp: johnd@company.com

If a new primary SMTP address is assigned and the old one is moved into the proxy
addresses, the error occurs:

   SMTP: JDoe@company.com
   smtp: John.Doe@company.com
   smtp: johnd@company.com

An error entry that is similar to the following entry appears in your Zscript.log
file:

   ******************************************************************
   Updating the Connected Directory's Foreign Users
   ******************************************************************
   Start of the LDAP update process
   Invalid modification response 20 - ATTRIBUTE OR VALUE EXISTS for object
   CN=SmallmouthB(Freshwater),CN=Foreign,OU=Harbor,O=Saltwater
   Update directory completed: 6 objects processed
   ******************************************************************
   Successful update of Connected Directory's Foreign Users
   ******************************************************************

The reason for this error is that the updates to the object are evaluated as a
whole by LDAP. Either all fields succeed or the record fails. When the values
are checked for otherMailbox against the existing record, the current primary
SMTP address will match the value that is destined for otherMailbox and the
error occurs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the issue, use one or more of the following methods:

 - Make the address change over two synchronization cycles to eliminate any
   conflict. To do this, change the primary SMTP address during one cycle, and
   then change the otherMailbox during the next cycle.

 - Edit the custom recipient through the Exchange Administrator tool.

 - Delete and then recreate the problem custom recipient through MMS. This means
   that all Custom Recipients (Foreign Users) will be deleted by the Management
   Agent and then re-added. To delete and then recreate the problem custom
   recipient through MMS:

   1. Back up your Management Agent templates before you proceed, because the
      following steps require you to make a parsing template modification that
      you will want to undo after you have processed the foreign user deletion.

Microsoft Metadirectory, click the article number below to view the article in

   2. WARNING: You must first delete all of the custom recipients that are
      created by this Management Agent. Because this could place a high load on
      your Exchange server if you have thousands of CRs, you must proceed with
      caution.

   3. Open Design MA\Connected Directory Foreign Entries\Foreign Entries Output
      Templates\Add, and then change the following entries from this

   A $v_dn
   (-objectClass: $v_oc)
   ($v_oc1)
   ($v_rdn)
   ($v_containerinfo)
   (-cn: $v_AccountName)
   (-Admin-Description: $v_description)
   (-Admin-Display-Name: $v_AdminDisplayNameRdn)
   (-co: $v_co)
   (-Company: $v_company)
   (-Target-Address: $v_targetaddress)
   (-mail: $v_mail)
   (-sn: $v_sn)
   (-givenName: $v_givenName)
   (-homePhone: $v_homePhone)
   (-initials: $v_initials)
   (-info: $v_comment)
   (-MAPI-Recipient: $v_MapiRecipient)
   (-mobile: $v_mobile)
   (-pager: $v_pager)
   (-uid: $v_AliasName)
   (-telephoneNumber: $v_telephoneNumber)
   (-textEncodedORAddress: $v_textEncodedORAddress)
   (-facsimileTelephoneNumber: $v_facsimileTelephoneNumber)
   (-st: $v_st)
   (-postalCode: $v_postalCode)
   (-attributeCertificate;base64: $md.attributeCertificate;base64)
   ($multi_valued("0",$userCertificate;base64,"-userCertificate;base64: "))
   (-cACertificate;base64: $md.cACertificate;base64)
   #(-thumbnailLogo;base64: $md.thumbnailLogo;base64)
   #(-thumbnailPhoto;base64: $md.thumbnailPhoto;base64)
   #(-jpegPhoto;base64: $md.thumbnailPhoto;base64)
   ---

      to this:

   D $v_dn
   ---

      Click OK.

   4. Open Operate MA\Operational Settings\Delta Operations, and then click to
      clear the Use Metadirectory Deltas to Update Foreign Users check box.

   5. Open Operate MA\Operational Settings\When Running the Management Agent.
      Set the Tasks to Run to Update Microsoft Exchange, and then set the Types
      of Object to Process to Process Custom Recipients.

   6. Run the Management Agent to delete all of the custom recipients that were
      created in Exchange, and note that this could take some time.

   7. After the custom recipients are deleted, you can restore your templates.

view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q255796 Updating a Management Agent's Templates from Its Working Folder

   8. Run the Management Agent again to re-populate the custom recipients in
      Exchange. At this point all of your custom recipients are back in Exchange
      with the correct addresses.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behaviour only occurs for values in the otherMailbox attribute within a
user object. LDAP does not run any uniqueness checks against SMTP addresses in
the targetAddress or mail attributes of other objects in the directory. This
occasionally results in duplicate SMTP addresses. For additional information
about how to resolve this problem, click the article number below to view the
