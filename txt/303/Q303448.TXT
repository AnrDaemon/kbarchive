   Q303450 XADM: Exchange 2000 Server LDAP Service Denial of Service Occurs When
   LDAP Is Handling Code


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Exchange Server Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) service is
processing unusually heavy LDAP request loads, the LDAP server may stop
responding (hang). This problem does not occur with ordinary LDAP loads and only
affects the LDAP service; all other Exchange Server services, including mail
handling, continue normally.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
