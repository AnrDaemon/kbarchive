The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network Version 7.0 
 - The Microsoft Network versions 6.0, 6.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You click the Write E-mail tab in MSN Explorer. The Write E-mail window appears,
but does not allow you to type in the body of the e-mail message.

CAUSE
=====

This can be caused if you have a contact in the address book that has the
nickname "editor".

RESOLUTION
==========

Either change the nickname of the contact named "editor", or configure MSN
Explorer so that the address list does not display when you compose e-mail
messages.

To change the nickname of the contact

1. Start MSN Explorer and sign in with the user tile you used when you
   experienced this issue.

2. On the top toolbar, click the E-mail button.

3. At the top of the window, click the Address Book tab.

4. Under the nickname field, find the contact with the nickname editor, and then
   select the word "editor".

5. In the box that appears, change the nickname to something other than editor,
   and then click OK. Now if you click the Write E-mail window, you can type
   into the message body.

To turn off the option for displaying the address list

1. Start MSN Explorer and sign in with the user tile you used when you
   experienced this issue.

2. In the upper-right corner, click Help And Settings.

3. In the menu on the left side, click E-mail.

4. Click Mail Preferences.

5. Clear the box labeled Display address list when writing e-mail, and then
   click Save Preferences.
   Now if you click Write E-mail, you can type into the message body.
