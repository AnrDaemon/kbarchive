SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the "check configuration" script item from Systems Management
Server (SMS) Installer to determine if the computer is running an operating
system that is later than Microsoft Windows 95, a computer that is running
Microsoft Windows 2000 is detected as being a version of Windows that is earlier
than Windows 95.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem use the Windows NT Running check configuration
option instead of the Windows 95 or Later Running option.

Installer version 2.0.148.00.
