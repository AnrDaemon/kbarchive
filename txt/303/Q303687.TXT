TITLE   :PRB: Duplicate Email When User Does Not Complete Password Change
PRODUCT :Microsoft Developer Network
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the user does not respond to a password change e-mail message in a specific
period of time, the user may receive redundant notification e-mail messages.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

1. From the Microsoft .NET Passport Web site, the user initiates a password
   change by e-mail, and then waits for the e-mail message to be delivered.

2. When the user receives the e-mail message from Passport, the user opens the
   e-mail message, and then clicks the link to create the new password.

3. The user waits for the page with the Please type in your new password dialog
   box to open in a browser window.

4. The user does not complete the password change operation, and closes the
   browser window.

5. The user waits less than 2 hours.

6. A second copy of the password change e-mail message is delivered.

7. The user waits 24 hours.

8. Note that a third copy of the password change e-mail message is delivered to
   the user.

Expected result: No e-mail message is delivered in step 6.

If the user clicks the link in the e-mail message to create a new password, one
of two things may occur that prevents the password change: either the system had
a problem, or the user did not complete the transaction within 120 minutes.

 - The system may have had a problem and did not complete processing the
   response (or both). If the user clicks the link in the e-mail message to
   create a new password, and the system has a problem, Passport does not detect
   this error and does not resend the e-mail message. The resend logic detects
   if the user has not clicked the link to create a new password, but does not
   detect if the system has a problem. The user can use the original mail from
   Passport to try the process again.

 - If the user clicks the link to create a new password and then does not
   complete the process within 120 minutes, as is described in the "Steps to
   Reproduce the Behavior" section of this article, the resend logic assumes
   that you have not clicked the link to create a new password and resends the
   e-mail message based on the resend period and retry limit that is defined in
   the Passport template table.

The daemon has no way to detect which case has actually occurred when it receives
TransTypeID of 31 to 40. The worst case (first scenario) is assumed.
