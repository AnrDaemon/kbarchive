PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Directory Security tab on the property sheet for a Web site
or folder in the Internet Services Manager (ISM) for Internet Information
Services (IIS), you may find that the Edit button for Secure Communications is
available, but clicking it does not open the Secure Communications property
sheet.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the file that controls the Secure Communications
property sheet becomes unregistered, corrupt, or inaccessible due to NTFS
permissions.

The following file controls the Secure Communications property sheet:

   %SystemRoot%\system32\inetsrv\Certmap.ocx

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, try to re-register Certmap.ocx by using the following
command:

   regsvr32 %systemroot%\system32\inetsrv\certmap.ocx

If you receive an error executing the command, or if it does not fix the problem,
verify that the user who is logged on has NTFS rights to access the file.
