   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to publish to or save a file to a Microsoft FrontPage extended
Web on a server that is using the Web Storage System (Microsoft Exchange 2000
Server or Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server), you receive one of the following
error messages:

   Cannot save file Filename.htm.

   -or-

   Cannot create file Filename.htm.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if either of the following conditions is true:

 - The Web you are connecting to is located on a Microsoft Exchange 2000 server
   that is only one level below the root folder--for example,
   http://<servername>/<public>/ where <servername> is the
   name of the server you are connecting to and <public> is the name of
   the virtual directory on the server. You cannot have sites in a Web Storage
   System at the root of a folder tree.

 - The Web you are connecting to is located in a path on a Microsoft SharePoint
   Portal Server that isn't accessible from Windows Explorer.

   NOTE: On a default installation of SharePoint Portal Server, the path is:

   \\.\backofficestorage

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use either of the following methods.

Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server
------------------------------

Configure and connect to a Web located one level lower in the directory
structure. For example, connect to http://servername/public/webname.

To configure the Frontpage Server Extensions for the new Web, follow these
steps:

1. Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for Internet Information Services
   (IIS).

2. Right-click the public level in the http://servername/public/webname path,
   point to New, and then click Server Extensions Web.

The New Web Wizard starts so that you can create a new Web at a lower level. Use
unique permissions and specify an administrator for the new Web.

Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Permanently mount the server drive to a drive letter that is recognized by
Windows Explorer. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Windows Start menu, click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

3. Locate and click the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EXIFS\Parameters

4. In the Details pane, double-click Drive Letter.

5. In the Value data box, type "<driveletter>" (without the quotation
   marks), where <driveletter> is any available drive.

6. Quit Registry Editor.

7. Restart the server.

Create a folder in the Web Storage System to contain the virtual directory that
will be the FrontPage Web. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start Windows Explorer by right-clicking the Windows Start menu and then
   clicking Explore on the menu that appears.

2. Locate and select the following folder:

   <driveletter>:\localhost\SharePoint Portal Server

3. Create a new folder. To do this, point to New on the File menu and then click
   Folder. Type a name for the new folder and press ENTER.

4. Start the MMC for IIS.

5. Right-click Default Web Site, point to New, and then click Virtual Directory.

6. Create the virtual directory and point to the folder you created in step 3.

7. Configure the Server Extensions for the new virtual Web. To do this,
   right-click the new virtual directory, point to New, and then click Server
   Extensions Web.

NOTE: Configure the Web to use a different administrator than the parent Web.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The instructions in the "Notes and Tips" topic in the Add-in for Web Storage
System Forms (Exfp.chm) Help file incorrectly state that you can configure the
extensions at the root of an alternate public folder tree. To connect to an
Exchange Public Folder, you must have a path that is at least two levels deep,
such as:

   http://servername/public/webname

Microsoft Visual Interdev or Microsoft FrontPage 98 cannot connect to these Webs
because they do not allow connections to Webs at this depth. However, you can
use Visual Interdev and Frontpage 98 to connect to the Root Web at
http://servername.
