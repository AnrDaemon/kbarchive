-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the system status, the status of the SMS Software Inventory
Processor component may appear as Critical. When you review SMS Software
Inventory Processor status messages, you may see thousands of 523 error status
messages. Also, when you view the Sinvproc.log file, you may see entries (that
are similar to the following entries) that indicate the SMS Software Inventory
Processor has repeatedly been unable to process a software inventory file (.sic
or .sid):

WARNING - Unable to generate resync for client without valid Client Id. !!
Process Cycle Completed.  

Eventually, the file is successfully processed, and the 523 status messages are
no longer generated.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS Software Inventory Processor attempts to process the Software Inventory
file before Inbox Manager Assistant has completed copying the file from the
Client Access Point to the Site Server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use a Status Filter rule to discard 523 error status
messages, or increase the critical threshold for the SMS Software Inventory
Processor within Component Status Summarizers properties.
