When you create a new package in the Systems Management Server (SMS)
Administrator console, you cannot type more than 64 characters in the "Share
name" box on the Data Access tab.

Note that you type a share name in the "Share name" box when you want to create a
package share on distribution points rather than using the default SMSPKGx$
share.
