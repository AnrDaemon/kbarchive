PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbvfp kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbvfp700 _IK283

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upsize a local Visual FoxPro database to a remote Microsoft SQL Server
database on another computer, the wizard creates the tables on the SQL server,
but the data is not moved to the SQL server.

CAUSE
=====

The path for the file that is created by the Upsizing Wizard for the bulk insert
is incorrect, and SQL Server is unable to find the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update is available from the Visual FoxPro product updates page at the
following Microsoft Developer Network (MDSN) Web site:

   http://msdn.microsoft.com/vfoxpro/downloads/updates.asp

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the Upsizing Wizard.

2. Select a Visual FoxPro database to upsize.

3. Select a database that points to a SQL server that resides on a different
   computer.

4. Choose a table to upsize and click Next.

5. Select New, and then type the name for the database to which you want to
   upsize.

NOTE: In order for SQL Server to run the bulk insert, the domain user account
that the SQL server runs under must be added to the Administators group on the
computer that runs the the Upsizing Wizard.
