TITLE   :IIS5: FTP Logon Fails for Passwords w/ Beginning Space or Spaces
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCOMIS kbWin2000PreSP3Fix kbWin2000sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use a password that contains a beginning space or spaces to
log on to a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site, you may receive the following
error message:

   530 The user cannot login

CAUSE
=====

FTP server removes all the spaces between the command (PASS) and its argument
(password), which leads to the removal of the beginning space or spaces of the
password. Because a wrong password is passed into local security agent, the
logon fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article

======

5.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows 2000 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 and Internet Information
   Services (IIS) 5.0.
