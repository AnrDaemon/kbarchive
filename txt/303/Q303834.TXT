OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbvfp kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbvfp700

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Visual FoxPro 7.0, the Windows Component Update
portion of the setup may not complete successfully and you may receive an error
message that resembles the following:

   winmain() error. Cannot locate expected executable last word of path or share
   name\wcu\runprog.exe C:\WINNT\System32\msiexec.exe

Each component that fails to install successfully has an X next to it in the list
that is displayed when the Windows Component Update completes.

CAUSE
=====

The path to the installation folder or the share contains a space.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Remove the spaces in your share name or path.

-or-

 - Install the components that fail by using their individual install routines,
   which are documented in the \WCU\Help\Moreinfo.htm file on the Visual FoxPro
   7.0 Professional CD.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur when you install Visual FoxPro from the CD on a
local computer or from a share that does not contain spaces in the path. The
problem can occur if you install Visual FoxPro from a shared CD with a space in
the share name, or if the CD contents are copied to a network share and the
share path contains a space.

Steps to Reproduce This Behavior
--------------------------------

1. Copy all of the directories and files from the Visual FoxPro CD. If you
   downloaded Visual FoxPro as an MSDN Universal Subscriber, copy the
   directories to a folder named Visual FoxPro .

2. Run the Setup program and select Windows Component Update.
