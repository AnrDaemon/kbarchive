TITLE   :PRB: Cursor Moves to First Column If You Use Keyboard to Scroll
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB kbDSupport kbVS600sp5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a DataGrid control is bound to a multiple-column recordset, when you position
the cursor in any column after the second column and scroll down past the
visible area, the cursor shifts from the nth column, at which it was positioned,
into the first column.

If the cursor appears in a column that does not allow the first column to be
seen, the cursor apparently dissapears because the cursor changes into the first
column, which is not visible. If you scroll left to the first column, the cursor
becomes visible.

This problem only occurs with the Visual Basic 6.0 Service Pack 5 DataGrid
control.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Data Project in Visual Basic. frmDataEnv is created by default.

2. Add an ADO Data Control and a DataGrid control to frmDataEnv.

3. Set the ConnectionString property of the ADO Data Control to point to a valid
   Northwind database.

4. Set the ADODC1 RecordSource property to point to the Orders table.

5. Leave all the defaults in the DataGrid. Point its Datasource property to
   ADODC1.

6. Run the project.

7. Click on the OrderDate column of the first row in the DataGrid. You can also
   click on any other column except the first column to reproduce the behavior.

8. Use the arrow keys to scroll down. Notice that when you pass the last visible
   row, the cursor shifts from the OrderDate (or the current column) to the
   first column.
