TITLE   :XCLN: Item Count Incorrect for Messages with Modified Permission
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5,5.5 SP1,5.5 SP2,5.5 SP3,5.5 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange550preSP5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Outlook 98 to connect to a mailbox that resides on a Microsoft
Exchange 2000 server, the item count as well as the number of items may be
incorrect. This behavior may occur when you receive new mail, change folders,
delete mail, or move mail from folder to folder.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is caused by a new permissions feature of Exchange 2000. When you
assign permissions to items using drive M, it affects the way the client
retrieves all items in the folder in which the permission assignment was made.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.
