TITLE   :Event Error: Target Folder Permissions Deny Access to XML Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Developer Network
PROD/VER::1.3,1.4,1.99,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4, 1.99, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to write Passport Network Map XML files, such as Partner.xml,
to the server hard disk, you may see the following error message in the Event
Log:

   Access Denied: Could not write to disk.

CAUSE
=====

The permissions for the target folder are set incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, set the permissions on the following folders to allow
the Everyone group full control:

On Windows NT 4.0 or 2000:

   Winnt\System32\MicrosoftPassport

On Windows XP:

   Windows\System32\MicrosoftPassport

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the XML files are fetched from the Nexus, they are not written to the disk
if Windows 2000 does not allow the Everyone group access to the System32 folder
and the person who is logged on is not an administrator.

If XML files are placed in the System32 folder as a workaround because the server
cannot communicate with the Nexus, Passport fails to load the XML files.
