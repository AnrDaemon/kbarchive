KEYWORDS:kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Asheron's Call, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are playing Asheron's Call, there may not be any sounds in the game.
Sounds work as expected in other programs.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when one of the following conditions is true:

 - Microsoft DirectX is not installed.

 - The sound card does not have current drivers installed.

 - The DirectX Hardware Sound Acceleration Level is set too high.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the following methods.

Method 1: Check Version of DirectX
----------------------------------

1. Browse to the following Microsoft Web site to see the current version of
   DirectX:

   http://www.microsoft.com/directx/

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type "DXDIAG" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

4. If you receive an error message, install the latest version of DirectX from
   the Web site listed in step 1.

   -OR-

   If the DirectX Diagnostic Tool starts, look on the System tab in the System
   Information dialog box for your DirectX version. If your version is earlier
   than the current version, install DirectX from the Web site listed earlier in
   this article.

If this fails to correct the problem, proceed with the next method.

Method 2: Test DirectX Sound
----------------------------

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "DXDIAG" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

3. If the Sound tab is missing in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool, install new sound
   card drivers.

4. On the Sound tab, click Test DirectSound, click Yes, and then follow the
   instructions to test all types of sound formats.

5. If this test fails, install new sound card drivers.
