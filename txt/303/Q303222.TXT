KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network version 6.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You start MSN Explorer and then sign in. You click the E-mail button in the top
toolbar, and then resize the window so that the links to Free Newsletters and
Special Links are no longer visible in the upper-right corner of the window. You
press TAB repeatedly until you have selected the Free Newsletters link. Even
though the information on the E-mail screen is too wide to fit in the window, a
horizontal scroll bar does not appear at the bottom of the window.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to return to the left-most section of the E-mail window, press TAB
two more times. This will select the Show Folders button and allow you to view
the left section of the e-mail window. This issue will be resolved in a future
release of MSN Explorer.
