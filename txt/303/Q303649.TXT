SYMPTOMS
========

After you restart the Systems Management Server (SMS) Site Component Manager,
User (Usrvariable characters.ddr) and User Group (Ugvariable characters.ddr)
discovery data records build up in the SMS\Inboxes\DDM.box file on the site
server.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur for the following two reasons:

 - Site Component Manager starts any component that is not currently started.

 - User Discovery (NTUSRDIS) and User Group Discovery (NTUG_DIS) run through a
   discovery interval when started, regardless of schedule.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Pack

To avoid this problem, disable user group and user discovery unless they are
needed.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.
