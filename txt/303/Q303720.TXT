TITLE   :Access Violation Occurs in Messenger Service During Shutdown
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During shutdown, the Messenger service may generate an access violation or may
stop responding (hang). The problem in the Messenger service is typically in
Msgsvc.dll, which runs under Services.exe.

CAUSE
=====

When the Messenger service receives a shutdown request (a service stop),
resources are deleted as follows:

 - DisplayThread termination

 - CriticalSection object MsgDisplayCriticalSection (for display thread)
   deletion

 - RPC I/F deletion

If the Messenger API is called between the second and third items by any threads,
the Messenger service can call the EnterCriticalSection function with a deleted
object. After RPC I/F is deleted, display-related resources (the first two
items) should be deleted.

==========
