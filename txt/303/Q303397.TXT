TITLE   :Cannot View Subcollections on Child Sites
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbui kbsms200preSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view subcollections on child sites, some subcollections may be shown in
the Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator console, and others may not
appear. For example, one child site may have a specific subcollection, while
another child site does not. Note that the missing subcollections are the
subcollections that are created from a parent site, not those that are created
locally to the child site.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS Administrator console only presents collections that are defined both in
the Collections and Collection_SubCollections SQL tables. Because of timing
issues, SMS Collection Evaluator and SQL Monitor may not correctly update both
tables.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

MORE INFORMATION
================

One method you can use to recover from a situation where subcollections are
missing at a child site is to manually update the collection from the site in
which it was created. This sends the collection-to-subcollection information
back down the hierarchy.
