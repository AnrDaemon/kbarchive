The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you shut down your -Microsoft Windows 95-based or Microsoft Windows
98-based computer that has the Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0
License Metering client agent installed, you may receive the following 9202
status message for the LICENSE_METERING component in the SMS Administrator
console:

   The software metering client on the computer "computer name" (user "user
   name") encountered an error and is performing an abnormal shut down.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur on a saturated LAN or WAN, or when the NetBEUI protocol
is being used. SMS only supports license metering over TCP/IP and IPX/SPX.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, improve network utilization to eliminate saturation
and verify that the license metering clients have TCP/IP or IPX/SPX installed as
their default protocol.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
