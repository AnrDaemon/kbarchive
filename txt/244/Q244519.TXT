TITLE   :XADM: How to Restore Multiple X.400 Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you troubleshoot a problem in a mailbox, distribution list, or custom
recipient, the X.400 address for an object may be missing. You can re-create the
X.400 address manually. If many objects are missing the X.400 address, you may
need to perform a directory import of the mailboxes to re-create the X.400
addresses.

NOTE: In Exchange Server versions 5.0 and 5.5 you cannot remove the X.400 address
type from multiple recipients by clicking to clear the address type in the Site
Addressing property page. You can only remove the X.400 address type from
individual recipients.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the X.400 addresses are removed from recipients, you can re-create them by
performing a simple export and import of the directory.

NOTE: The new X.400 addresses are built on the current information in the
directory. This process does not rebuild custom X.400 addresses.

To re-create the X.400 addresses:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, on the Tools menu, click
   Directory Export.

2. Click Export File, and then in the File Name box, type a name for the .csv
   file that you want to create (for example, Export.csv). If you are prompted
   to create the file, click Yes.

3. Click Container, and then click the container that holds the recipients that
   have missing X.400 addresses. If appropriate, click Include Subcontainers.

4. Under Export Objects, be sure that Mailboxes, Distribution Lists, and Custom
   Recipients are selected.

5. Click Export. When the export process is finished, click OK.

6. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, on the Tools menu, click
   Directory Import.

7. Click Import File, and then click the .csv file that you created in step 2.

8. Click Import.

The import process re-creates the X.400 address for each recipient that doesn't
have one. The import process doesn't change any other attributes, unless the
Export.csv file was edited in the time between the export process and import
process.
