TITLE   :XADM: Year Displayed Incorrectly After Restoring Backup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbYear2000 exc4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you perform a backup using the Windows NT Backup program (Ntbackup.exe) that
is included with Exchange Server 4.0 on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT
Server 3.51, and then restore the backup, the backup date that is displayed in
the Backup.log file and the Restore Status window may be incorrect. For example,
if you perform the backup and restore operations during the year 2000, the year
may be displayed as 1900 instead. This problem only occurs with the date that is
displayed on the following line:

   Backup performed on 02/29/1900 at 12:57 AM

All other dates in the Backup.log file and the Restore Status window are
displayed correctly. This problem is not likely to occur before the year 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported software update that corrects this problem is now available from
Microsoft, but it has not been fully regression tested and should be applied
only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
