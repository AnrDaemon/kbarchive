   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Outlook Web Access (OWA), the initial logon window may appear blank.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange Server and OWA are on different servers and the Exchange
Server computer that was specified during the OWA setup is not available or has
been removed from the site.

RESOLUTION
==========

If there is another server in the same site, you can edit the registry so that
OWA gets its directory information from that server.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To change the server that OWA gets its directory information from:

1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the Server value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeWEB\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click String, type "<server name>" (without the
   quotation marks), and then click OK.

4. Quit the Registry Editor.
