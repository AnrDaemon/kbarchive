incorrectly states that it is possible to use a Window NT Workstation-based

   The two subnets that do not contain computers running Windows NT Server DHCP
   service have a computer running Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server
   that acts as DHCP relay or bootP relay agent.

This problem occurs because of a documentation error in The Windows NT Server
Networking Guide.
