TITLE   :Cannot Save Office 97 Files to Terminal Server ICA Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbinterop kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to save a Microsoft Office 97 file to a client computer that is
using the Citrix Metaframe Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) client by
using the Save As command and browsing through Network Neighborhood back to your
client computer, you receive the following error message:

   You do not have access to the client folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior so that you can save an Office 97 file to a local
drive or share on your Terminal Server client computer (that is using the
Metaframe ICA client), use the mapped drive letters that are created by default
during the Terminal Server logon process:

1. When you are ready to save an Office 97 file, click Save As on the File menu.

2. In the Save In box, click a locally mapped drive to which you want to save
   the file. The locally mapped drives have a <driveletter>$ designation.
