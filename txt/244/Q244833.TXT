   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an .ost file for offline storage, you can set the synchronization
interval. In some cases, if you enable your .ost file and then view the
synchronization interval, the interval is set to a number from 15,000,000 to
999,999,999. If you change the number and then quit and log off of the client,
when you log back on, the interval value is set to a new number different from
the number you specified.

Even if you change this interval in the registry, a new large number is put in
the place of the default (60) minutes.

CAUSE
=====

The registry key used to store this value is either incorrect or damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Quit and log off of Outlook.

2. Start Registry Editor, and delete the following key:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Outlook\Options\General\AutoSyncInt

3. Restart Outlook.

After you restart Outlook, the registry key is recreated and the interval is set
to the default.
