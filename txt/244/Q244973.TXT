TITLE   :SNA Server Client Returns APPC Error 0001 0000015B

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to establish a connection to an AS/400 with the APPC security check
box enabled in the SNA Manager Subdomain Security folder, an SNA Server 5250
client may return the following APPC error:

   primary_rc = X'0001' (AP_PARAMETER_CHECK)
   secondary_rc = X'0000015B' (AP_BAD_PARTNER_LU_ALIAS)

This can also happen with an independent LU 6.2 connection to a host. The primary
APPC return code is (0001) and the secondary return code is (0000015B). This
error also appears in the display portion of the LU-LU test when you use the
APPC session viewer in SNA Manager.
This error is returned when the user does not have authority to establish a
conversation over the Remote APPC LU being requested by the APPC or CPI-C
application (this error can also occur if the application is requesting a Remote
APPC LU that is not configured on an SNA Server computer).

WORKAROUND
==========

To verify whether or not APPC security is enabled, check the properties of the
SNA subdomain, by clicking the Security tab. If the APPC security check box is
checked, then the user must be configured to have permissions to the Local and
Remote APPC LU under the configured users folder. The other option is to turn
off APPC security.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This following example is a sample of the output when you run the LU-LU test
with APPC security enabled in the APPC Session Viewer:

   TP_Started primary rc: 0H
   *** Allocate Failed ***
   Allocate Primary RC : 1H
   Allocate Secondary RC : 15BH
   Please check the application event logs for further details on why the
   allocate failed.
   The Partner LU Alias is incorrectly configured. Check session configuration.
