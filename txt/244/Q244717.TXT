TITLE   :RAS Port Becomes Unavailable in Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork kbuikbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a RAS client disconnects from a RAS connection, some RAS ports may become
unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when a RAS client disconnects a RAS connection. When this
happens, a port status mismatch may occur between Rasman.exe and Rassrv.exe.
When this mismatch occurs, the port event handler is not called and the port is
not reinitialized. Because of this, the port becomes unavailable.

==========
