TITLE   :XADM: Event ID 1197 and 1005 When Starting the Information Store
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the information store (Store.exe), it does not start,
and the following events appear in the event log:

   Event ID: 1197
   Source: MSExchangeIS Private
   Type: Error
   Category: General
   Description: Database is too new to be upgraded.

   Event ID: 1005
   Source: MSExchangeIS Private
   Type: Error
   Category: General
   Description: Unable to start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store. Error
   0x451.

Although the information store does not start, the information store databases
are not damaged.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you perform one of the following actions:

 - You restore a Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2651.32 after the
   information store databases have already been upgraded to version 2.45.

 - You restore a Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2652.68 after the
   information store databases have already been upgraded to version 2.46.

These earlier versions of the Store.exe file do not support the new database
formats.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - If the information store databases have already been upgraded to version
   2.45, restore version 5.5.2651.32 or later of the Store.exe file, and then
   attempt to start the information store again.

 - If the information store databases have already been upgraded to version
   2.46, restore version 5.5.2652.68 or later of the Store.exe file, and then
   attempt to start the information store again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you apply version 5.5.2651.32 or later of the Store.exe file on an Exchange
Server computer, and then start the information store, the information store
databases are automatically upgraded to a new format, and the following events
appear in the event log:

   Event ID: 1185
   Source: MSExchangeIS Private
   Type: Information
   Category: General
   Description: Successfully upgraded database to version <version>.

   Event ID: 1185
   Source: MSExchangeIS Public
   Type: Information
   Category: General
   Description: Successfully upgraded database to version <version>.

where <version> is 2.45 if you applied a Store.exe file earlier than
version 5.5.2652.68, or 2.46 if you applied version 5.5.2652.68 or later.

After the databases have been upgraded to version 2.45, you can restore an
earlier version of the Store.exe file on the server, but only if it is version
5.5.2651.32 or later. Similarly, after the databases have been upgraded to
version 2.46, you can restore an earlier version of the Store.exe file on the
server, but only if it is version 5.5.2652.68 or later. If you restore a
Store.exe file earlier than the above versions, and then attempt to start the
information store, you experience the behavior described in the "Symptoms"
section, but the information store databases are not damaged.
