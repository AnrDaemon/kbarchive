PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2000
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Outlook 2000 on a computer that does not have Microsoft
Schedule+ already installed on it, you may receive the following error message:

   Unable to Switch to Microsoft Schedule+ as your primary calendar.

CAUSE
=====

When you install Outlook 2000 with the Terminal Server transform file (MST), all
of the files necessary to use Schedule+ are not installed. The installation
expects that Schedule+ should already be installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use either of the following methods:

Method A
--------

Install the following files into the Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\1033
folder:

   Can32.cfg
   Req32.cfg
   Rpn32.cfg
   Rpp32.cfg
   Rpt32.cfg
   Mcs.ico
   Mc.ico
   Mrs.ico
   Mr.ico
   Mrns.ico
   Mrn.ico
   Mrps.ico
   Mrp.ico
   Mrts.ico
   Mrt.ico

You can get these files from another computer that is running Schedule+ 7.5 on
the same operating system, or from the distribution CD for Microsoft Exchange
Client 5.0 Service Pack 2.

Method B
--------

Install Schedule+ and Exchange Client 5.0 before you install Outlook 2000.
