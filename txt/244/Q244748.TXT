TITLE   :14 Character Password Limitation in IMS Logon Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.5,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.5 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enter the logon information in Internet Mail Service (IMS), you are
unable to enter more than 14 characters in the Password box.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the maximum password length that is allowed in the
Password box is 14 characters. Some Internet service providers (ISPs) may assign
a computer-generated password larger than 14 characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact your ISP to shorten your password to use 14
characters or less.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some Internet service providers may not be able to provide a shorter password.
Without the complete password, the Microsoft Exchange Server cannot log on to
the ISP.
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
