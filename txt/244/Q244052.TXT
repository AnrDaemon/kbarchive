MORE INFORMATION

AFP is a set of rules and conventions created by IBM. These rules and
conventions govern various data types, such as text, font, image, graphics, bar
codes color, multimedia, and so on. IBM developed specific document architecture
to accommodate these data types. MO:DCA-P (Mixed Object Document Content
Architecture-Presentation) is this specification. This architecture supports the
storage and interchange of such data types on such platforms as IBM Mainframes,
AS/400 systems, RISC System/6000 and OS/2 for printing to IBM impact, laser, PCL
supported and PostScript supported print devices and print queues.
