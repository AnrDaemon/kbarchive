SUMMARY
=======

To find a location on a map by using the latitude and longitude of that
location, you must enter the coordinates in decimal degrees.

If the coordinates you want to enter are in degrees and minutes, you need to
convert the number of minutes to a decimal value.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To convert the number of minutes to a decimal value, use the following formula:

   Decimal value = Minutes/60

As an example, a latitude of 122 degrees 45 minutes North is equal to 122.75
degrees North.

REFERENCES
==========

A tool that you can use to convert coordinates from degrees, minutes, and
seconds to decimal degrees is available at the following MP2K Magazine Web
site:

   http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/bickel/DDDMMSS-decimal.html

To convert Seconds to decimals, divide by 3600.

   Decimal value = Seconds/3600

As an example, a latitude of 122 degrees 45 minutes 45 seconds North is equal to
122.7625 degrees North.

So the complete formula looks similar the following:

   Decimal value = Degrees + (Minutes/60) + (Seconds/3600)
