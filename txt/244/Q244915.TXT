======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After Daylight Savings Time ends, your Windows NT Server-based computer may be
delayed in reflecting the correct time. While minutes and seconds are listed
correctly, the hour may be off by one. For example, it should display 1:01am,
but displays 2:01am instead. This problem may be seen on other Windows NT
Server-based computers if they are performing time synchronization by using the
W32time service. Also, after a few minutes, the problem fixes itself.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain and apply the latest service pack for Windows
NT.

To prevent this problem from occurring, do not start the server, restart the
server, or change the time on the server within six hours before the Daylight
Savings Time change.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
