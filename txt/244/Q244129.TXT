The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Notes Connector cannot deliver mail when a Lotus Notes
user either sends mail that contains an SMTP address with an apostrophe (') in
the user name or replies to mail that contains an SMTP address with an
apostrophe in the user name. For example, the user name, user.o'hara, contains
an apostrophe. The following events are logged in the application event log:

   31500 : MSExchangeNotes : Information : notes to exchange
   Sender: user/cert@domain, size xxxx, Message id: C=US, a= , p=microsoft,
   l:messageid date time, notes:domain (servername/cert).
   (mexe)
   31501 : MSExchangeNotes: Information : transport to exchange
   Report generated : sender: system administrator. message id..........etc
   (mexe)
   31040 : MSExchangeNotes : Warning : transport to exchange
   No valid message recipients in message
   (mexin)
   31092 : MSExchangeNotes : Information : transport to exchange
   Message contains empty recipient list, purging item automatically.
   (mexin)

CAUSE
=====

The apostrophe character (') is not allowed when checking the user name.
