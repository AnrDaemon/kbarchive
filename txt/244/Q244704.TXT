SUMMARY
=======

If you try to create a shortcut by dragging and dropping an unregistered 16-bit
or 32-bit executable file, the application may not run properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 2000 physically moves the EXE file to its drop destination rather than
creating a shortcut.

This behavior is new in Windows 2000. If the application is registered using the
Windows Installer, users will be able to create a shortcut as in previous
versions of Windows. For unregistered applications, the procedure is to
right-click and drag to create a shortcut.
