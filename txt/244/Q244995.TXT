   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

After you apply the latest Windows NT 4.0 service pack to your Windows NT-based
computer, it is necessary to manually enable base system object restrictions to
prevent unauthorized access to various system-level files. Access to these files
may be used to circumvent some of the security functions of the operating
system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To restrict changes to base system objects, use Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) to
locate the ProtectionMode value under the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager

Verify that a DWORD value with a value of 1 exists, and if it does not exist or
has a value of 0, add it to this key, or edit the value to be 1.
