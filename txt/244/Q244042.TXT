KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may need to change permissions for a hierarchy of public folders in unison,
for example, if a new group of users needs to be able to modify and delete
entries in the public folders that are included in a hierarchy.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot change permissions using the Microsoft Exchange Client or Microsoft
Outlook without modifying each folder manually. However, if you use the
Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, you can change permissions for
a hierarchy of public folders in unison by performing the following steps:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program, and then find the top-level
   folder of the hierarchy that needs a uniform change in permissions.

2. To open the properties of the top-level folder, click to select it, and then
   on the File menu, click Properties.

3. To change the top-level folder permissions, click the General tab, and then
   click Client Permissions.

4. After you modify the permissions as necessary, click the General tab of the
   top-level folder, click to select the "Propagate these properties to all
   subfolders" check box, and then click Apply.

WARNING: When you click to select the "Propagate these properties to all
subfolders" check box, and then click Apply, any existing permissions in the
subfolders are lost.
The "Propagate these properties to all subfolders" check box may not appear on
the General tab of a public folder. For additional information, click the
