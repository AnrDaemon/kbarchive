SUMMARY
=======

The Sms_License_Server service (Remodbc.exe) runs on Software Metering servers.
This service reads the data cache and grants or denies access to clients when
they request licenses.

MORE INFORMATION

By default, no logging is enabled for Remodbc. To enable logging, add the
following section to the Remodbc.ini file on both the Systems Management Server
site server and the Software Metering servers:

   [Logging]
   Logon=1
   FileName=Remodbc.log
   BackupName=Remodbc.lo_
   MaxSize=200000
