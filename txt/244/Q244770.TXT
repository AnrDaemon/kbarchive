SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit StorStat utility in
Administrator Mode (the storstat -a command), the following error message may be
displayed:

   Cannot parse a result message. From: "<mailbox display name>", Body:
   "*(&IGY&F*(&*@#T@#&*DG,2.03,1,Microsoft Exchange
   Server,Mail..."

CAUSE
=====

This error message is displayed if the user whose mailbox name is listed in the
error message sends a report to the StorStat utility mailbox, and that mailbox
display name contains a comma.

RESOLUTION
==========

Log on to the StorStat utility mailbox from an Exchange Client or Outlook, open
the message with the title <<user results>> that was sent from that
user, remove the comma from the mailbox display name, save the change, and then
run the storstat -a command again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The report that the user sent contains a comma-separated line of numbers. When
the StorStat utility analyzes the report, the utility uses commas as delimiters.
If a comma is in the mailbox display name, the StorStat utility considers the
comma in the mailbox display name a delimiter, and the error message in the
"Symptoms" section of this article is displayed.

For more information about how to use the StorStat utility, please refer to the
Exchange Server Help files that are shipped with the BackOffice Resource Kit,
Second Edition and the BackOffice 4.5 Resource Kit.
