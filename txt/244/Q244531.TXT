-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, version 3.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG #: 56502 (SQLBUG_70)

SYMPTOMS
========

Using ODBC Administrator, If you reopen an existing SQL Server DSN and click
Finish on the first screen, it may revert the security mode from standard SQL
security to integrated security. This may cause login failure when you connect
to SQL Server if the requirements for Windows NT Authentication are not
satisfied.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is not to click Finish on the first screen when you edit an
existing SQL Server DSN. If you go through the other screens during second edit
of DSN, the problem will not occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in MDAC 2.6.

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Set up a DSN using SQL Server ODBC driver with standard SQL security.

2. On the last screen , click Finish and make sure the Use Integrated Security
   attribute is selected as "No".

3. Click OK to save the DSN.

4. Reopen the DSN and click Finish on the first screen, notice the Use
   Integrated Security attribute has changed to "Yes".
