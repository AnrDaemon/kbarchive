-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using Printer.Print without first setting Printer.FontName and Printer.FontSize
may produce a printout in a different font when the same application is used on
different computers or with different printers.

CAUSE
=====

If you use Printer.Print without first setting Printer.FontName and
Printer.FontSize, the operating system selects a font for you based on numerous
parameters, including which fonts are installed and the characteristics of the
output device.

RESOLUTION
==========

Explicitly set Printer.FontName and Printer.FontSize before printing.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you select an unavailable font, the operating system uses font substitution
to select a font for you. To avoid this, check the Printer.Fonts property, which
returns an array of all fonts that are supported for the current printer. See
online Help for details.
