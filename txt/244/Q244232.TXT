SUMMARY
=======

In order to add the Context Help Button(?) to the top right corner of a
CPropertySheet so that it shows up on all the tabs of the sheet, you need to
override the OnInitDialog method of the CPropertySheet and call the
ModifyStyleEx() function with the first parameter of 0 and the second set to
WS_EX_CONTEXTHELP.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps can be used to add the context help button to a MFC property
sheet.

1. Using AppWizard create a default dialog based application called "Sample" and
   add a button resource to it. Using ClassWizard, add a BN_CLICKED handler for
   this button.

2. Insert a Property Sheet Resource, by choosing Project, Add to Project,
   Components and Controls..., Visual C++ Components, now select Property Sheet
   and click Insert

3. Click OK on the dialog box that is displayed. This will bring up another
   wizard to choose the type of the property sheet.

4. Select the Property Sheet radio button and click Next. Take default setting
   on the next screen and click Next.

5. On the next screen where it says "What class would you like to give access to
   this property sheet?", choose CSampleDlg. Take the default settings on the
   next two screens and click Finish. Click Close in the Components and Controls
   Gallery dialog box.

6. Go to the Button Handler and add the following code:

   void CSampleDlg::OnButton1() 
   {
       CMyPropertySheet pSheet;
       pSheet.DoModal();
   }

7. Using ClassView, override the OnInitDialog virtual function by right-clicking
   CMyPropertySheet and selecting Add Virtual Function.... Select OnInitDialog
   on the left and click the Add and Edit button.

8. Add the following code to the OnInitDialog virtual function:

   BOOL CMyPropertySheet::OnInitDialog() 
   {
       BOOL bResult = CPropertySheet::OnInitDialog();
       ModifyStyleEx(0, WS_EX_CONTEXTHELP); 
       return bResult;
   }

Build the project and run it. If you click the the button on the dialog box, you
should notice the property sheet gets displayed with the Context Help
Button(?).
