generate a "stop 0xc000021a" error message (bugcheck). If you perform a user
dump, it displays the following register contents and the thread call stack at
the time of failure:

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur under low memory conditions. When this occurs, creation
of the console window can fail, and the "FreeConsoleHandle" call is made without
locking the console handle table.
