The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After an upgrade from Windows 95 or Windows 98 to Windows 200, users who try to
start an application listed in Migdb.inf receive a dialog box displaying the
application's status. The user is then given the option to start, remove, or
restore the shortcut for the application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Applications listed in the Windows 2000 Upgrade Report as incompatible,
requiring reinstallation, or exhibiting minor problems will be "linkstubbed"
with the dialog box in their Start menu shortcuts. Therefore, when the user
attempts to start the application from the shortcut, the "start-remove-restore"
message will appear before Windows will start the application.
