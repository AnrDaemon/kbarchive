SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to back up a Visual SourceSafe database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Make sure that no one is using the database and that Analyze will not begin
   to run while you are backing up the database.

2. Copy the following folders:

   

   \DATA
   \Temp
   \USERS

3. Copy the User.txt and Srcsafe.ini files.

When you follow this procedure, you can do a full restore of the database by
replacing the existing Users, Temp and Data folders as well as the Users.txt and
Srcsafe.ini files with the copied versions.

You can also use this procedure to move the database to another location by
placing the copied files into a new folder. To open the database, on the File
menu in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, click Open SourceSafe Database to browse
to the new location.
