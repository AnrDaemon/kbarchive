The information in this article applies to:

 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you try to open a form created with the Microsoft Exchange Client Forms
Designer or the Outlook Forms Designer on a computer running Micorosft Windows
NT 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, the form does not start. The message
"installing form" appears, but then Outlook stops responding.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You must have supporting .dll files for the forms to work on Terminal Server.

There are two methods that you can use to install the supporting .dll files
without having to keep the client Forms Designer installed on Terminal Server.

The first method is to run the client Forms Designer Setup program on the server,
re-run Setup, and click Remove All. This removes the client Forms Designer,
however, the supporting .dll files are not removed because they are considered
shared components.

NOTE: You can install the client Forms Designer from the Microsoft Exchange
Windows NT client, version 5.0, compact disk. The program is in the following
folder:

   Clients\Retail\Eng\Efdsetup

The second method is to manually copy the needed files from a computer that has
the Exchange Client Forms Designer installed on it. The necessary files are:

   Dao2516.dll
   Msajt200.dll
   Vaen21.olb
   Msjeterr.dll
   Vbajet.dll
   Msjetint.dll
   Vbdb16.dll

Copy these seven files into the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder on the Terminal
Server computer.

You then need to run the Regsvr.exe executable file, to register the 16-bit
Microsoft Jet DAO Library. Use the following parameters:

   Regsvr.exe Da02516.dll

NOTE: In some cases, the registration of the 16-bit Microsoft Jet DAO Library has
to be performed each time a user logs on to the Terminal Server session. This
can be done through a system logon script.

By default, users have write access to all portions of the Windows registry on
the Terminal Server computer. However, if you have any custom Outlook forms
installed on the computer, and you have configured the Windows registry on the
Terminal Server computer to restrict user access, then users must have write
access to the following registry key:

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID

NOTE: In addition to setting the permissions for all users to have write access,
you may also have to set the permissions to "Interactive" if the default
permissions have been changed.
