SUMMARY
=======

This article contains comments, corrections, and information about known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book Designing Relational Database Systems, ISBN
0-7356-0634-X.

The following topics are covered:

 - Page xviii: Email Address Is Incorrect

 - Page 14: Entities Should Be Attributes

 - Page 44: Figure 3-1 Is Incorrect

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page xviii: Email Address Is Incorrect
--------------------------------------

On page xviii in the Using the Companion CD section, the email address for
reporting problems is given as MSINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM.

The correct email address is MSPINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM.


Page 14: Entities Should Be Attributes
--------------------------------------

On page 14, in the second paragraph, "entities" should be "attributes".

Change:
"Do you model the address as a single entity (the Address) or as a set of
entities (HouseNumber, Street, City, State, ZipCode)? "

To:
"Do you model the address as a single entity (the Address) or as a set of
attributes (HouseNumber, Street, City, State, ZipCode)?"


Page 44: Figure 3-1 Is Incorrect
--------------------------------

On page 44, Figure 3-1 is incorrect. Weak entities only exist because some other
entity exists, so Figure 3-1 is not accurate as it shows a zero or one
relationship. Please replace all "zero" symbols with the "many" symbol.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
