   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to determine if your Windows-based computer is
started in Debug mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To determine if a Windows-based computer is started in Debug mode, verify the
computer's startup options in the registry:

1. Start Registry Editor.

2. Locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control

3. In the Control key, locate the SystemStartOptions string value. If the
   computer is in Debug mode, one or more of the debug switches are displayed in
   the string (for example, /debug, /crashdebug, /debugport, or /baudrate). Any
   combination of one or more of these switches indicates that the computer is
   currently in Debug mode. If the computer was started with no options
   specified, this value is blank.

NOTE: This registry value is updated every time the computer starts, and contains
the options specific for your current boot selection in the Boot.ini file.
