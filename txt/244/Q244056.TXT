The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Network dynamic data exchange (DDE) to communicate between a Windows
NT service and an interactive application on the same machine, the Netdde.exe
service may deadlock. This problem occurs only when multiple connection attempts
are rapidly made. The application or service may appear to stop responding
(hang), and the task manager will be unable to end Netdde.exe. Attempting to
shut down Windows NT will fail unless Netdde.exe has been ended by using a
debugger or the Kill utility from the Windows NT Resource Kit.
