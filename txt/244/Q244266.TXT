TITLE   :WD97: Word Template Hyperlink Opens Instead of New Document
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word8 word97

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a hyperlink to a Word 97 template in a Web browser, the template
opens in the browser, instead of Word creating a new document that is based on
the template.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior of Microsoft Word, create a hyperlink to a shortcut
rather than to the template. To do this, follow these steps:

1. To create a shortcut to your template, right-click the template file in
   Windows Explorer. Then click Create Shortcut on the menu that appears
   (shortcut menu).

2. Create a hyperlink to the shortcut LNK file, not the template file.

   IMPORTANT NOTE: If you create the hyperlink to the shortcut by clicking
   Hyperlink on the Insert menu, and then you click Browse to find the shortcut
   file, the problem still occurs, because the shortcut resolves to that actual
   template. In order for this workaround to work correctly, you must manually
   type the path to the shortcut in the Hyperlink dialog box.

After you click the shortcut to the Word template, click Open to open a new
document based on the template. After the new document is opened in your Web
browser, you can save it to your system.
