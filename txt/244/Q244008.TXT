======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Exchange Server can selectively limit access to Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP) mail for specific users. You can prevent specific users from sending or
receiving SMTP mail in two ways. One is to restrict inbound SMTP mail to
specific users, and a second is to restrict outbound SMTP mail from specific
users. This article explains how to accomplish these two tasks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Restrict Inbound SMTP Mail to Specific Users
--------------------------------------------

To prevent a user from receiving inbound SMTP mail, remove the SMTP address from
the user's mailbox.

1. In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, open the properties
   on the mailbox you want to restrict.

2. Click the Email Addresses tab.

3. Click the SMTP address, and click the Remove button.

NOTE: If the X.500 address of the Exchange Server user is known, inbound SMTP
mail can still be delivered to a user whose SMTP address has been removed from
the Email Addresses page.


Restrict Outbound SMTP Mail from Specific Users
-----------------------------------------------

To prevent a user from sending outbound SMTP mail, set a delivery restriction on
the Internet Mail Service to reject all messages from that user:

1. On the Internet Mail Service Properties page, click the Delivery Restrictions
   tab.

2. Under Reject Messages From, click List.

3. Click Modify, and click the mailbox you want to restrict.

The Internet Mail Service will now reject any outbound messages that it receives
from that mailbox.

NOTE: The removal of SMTP addresses for a large number of users can be
accomplished with a bulk import. For additional information, click the article
