The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The security instance of a new object may have a permissions entry of NO
PERMISSIONS for that class of the object. This entry is created the first time
that a new user creates an object of that type. For example, the first time a
new user creates a package, a corresponding security object appears showing NO
PERMISSIONS. The NO PERMISSIONS result can occur only on collections and
queries.

For example, if you apply instance-level rights to either a query or a
collection, two items appear in the Security Rights folder for the user:

 - The instance-level rights that were granted

 - NO PERMISSIONS for all instances for the class level.

This means that even though a client may have security rights to a specific class
through group membership, this entry is created.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To find this entry, click Security Rights in the Administrator console and sort
by user name. There is an entry that shows the permissions for a new object and
a NO PERMISSIONS entry. That user can change the NO PERMISSIONS entry to
Administer.

This is the correct behavior. This class permission is used to provide the
necessary rights to the object in case the user no longer has the proper
credentials through group membership. Essentially, if the user's group
permissions were revoked, the user would have permissions only for the instances
the user created or items on which the user had granted permissions.

The user who creates the object that adds the NO PERMISSIONS entry can also
change that NO PERMISSIONS entry to Administer, which seems to grant that user
full permissions to that class. This is not the case. The only object of that
class that the user would be able to see after losing permissions through group
membership are the objects that that particular user created.

If you delete any instance object that has a corresponding NO PERMISSIONS
security object, the NO PERMISSIONS security object becomes orphaned and is not
deleted.
