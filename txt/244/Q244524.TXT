   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Exchange Server online defragmentation against the information store databases
starts immediately after information store maintenance tasks have been
completed. By default, the online defragmentation process runs for a minimum of
fifteen minutes and it only runs for up to one hour after the information store
maintenance scheduled window time. You can change these times by editing the
registry.

NOTE: If information store maintenance does not complete any tasks against the
information store databases and a previous online defragmenation finished in
full, online defragmenation does not run.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To configure the length of time that online defragmentation runs after the
information store maintenance window:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPrivate

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

   Value Name: OLD Completion Time
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: Set the value to the number of seconds that you want to allow an
   overrun of the information store maintenance window (0 for no overrun, and
   the default is one hour: 1*60*60 seconds).

4. Add this value to the public information store as well in the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPublic

5. If you want to override the minimum length of time that online
   defragmentation runs, add the following value:

   Value Name: OLD Minimum RunTime
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: Set the value to the minimum number of seconds that you want to let the
   old process run (the default is fifteen minutes: 15*60 seconds).

6. Quit Registry Editor.

NOTE: When the information store maintenance tasks and online defragmentation are
complete, there is an opportunity for the cycle to begin again if there is time
left in the information store maintenance window. A check is made every fifteen
minutes to make sure that the server is in the information store maintenance
time frame.
