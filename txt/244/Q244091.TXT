TITLE   :WLBS Does Not Respond to ARP Requests
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Load Balancing Service 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows Load Balancing Service (WLBS) cluster host may not respond to Address
Resolution Protocol (ARP) requests under stress. A client must be able to map
the cluster's virtual IP address to the cluster's media access control (MAC)
address with ARP to be able to access services that are being load balanced. All
other network communication may function normally.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when the cluster host tries to reply to ARP requests but
ARP send packets are retained in Ndis.sys.
