KEYWORDS:kbsms200bug kbsms200fix kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a environment in which multiple NetWare Directory Services (NDS) servers are
a part of the same Systems Management Server (SMS) site, you may be unable to
control to which NDS servers SMS clients attach.

For example, assume that you have a SMS site that contains two NDS servers: NW1
and NW2. Both servers function as logon points (LPs), client access points
(CAPs), and distribution points (DPs) for the site. An SMS client uses NW1 as
its preferred server for logon and you have used the Prefserv utility to
configure NW1 as the client's preferred CAP and DP. When you log on to this
client, the client is attached to both NDS servers. Reviewing the client's
Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) registry key shows that both servers are listed
as preferred.

For more information about the Prefserv utility, see the Microsoft Systems
Management Server Resource Kit (included with the Microsoft BackOffice Resource
Kit) and the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
