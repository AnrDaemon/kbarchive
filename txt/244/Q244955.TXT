TITLE   :PRB: MinDependency Project May Need to Include Atl.dll
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::3.0,6.0

KEYWORDS:kbCOMt kbContainer kbRegistry kbVC600 kbATL300 kbDSupport kbGrpDSMFCATL

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) 3.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

ATL projects built for MinDependency will still need Atl.dll if they use ATL
control containment code.

CAUSE
=====

ATL's control containment implements interfaces that are described by the type
library in Atl.dll.

RESOLUTION
==========

Include the Atl.dll file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

ATL's control containment implements two dual interfaces,
IDocHostUIHandlerDispatch and IAxWinAmbientDispatch, as a part of the control
container. Because the dual interfaces are implemented using IDispatchImpl, they
delegate to the type library for implementation of IDispatch methods. This
requires the type library describing these interfaces to be registered. This
type library exists in Atl.dll.

Additional query words: IDocHostUIHandlerDispatch, IAxWinAmbientDispatch IDispatchImpl static
