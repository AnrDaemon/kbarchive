TITLE   :"STOP 0x00000050" in Rdr.sys with Special Pool Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience random blue-screen error messages in Windows NT with pool
corruption. When you have the Special Pool feature enabled, you may receive the
following error message on a blue screen as a result of pool corruption:

   Stop 0x00000050 (0xf6eb8000, 0x00000001, 0x00000000, 0x80156000)

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of a 4-byte overrun in Rdr.sys that is caused when
a third-party Server Message Block (SMB) server returns a 36-byte buffer when
SMB_QUERY_FILE_BASIC_INFO is sent back to the client. Typically, a 40-byte
buffer is returned. This causes the buffer to be off by 4 bytes and Rdr.sys to
write past its allocated pool.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.
