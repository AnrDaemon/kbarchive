SYMPTOMS
========

When multiple drives are mapped to the same NetWare server, Word may not resolve
the path correctly when you use the FILENAME /p field. Instead of the correct
drive, Word may display the path relative to another mapped drive to the NetWare
server.

Example:

Result: The field resolves to "f:\user\'docname'"
Expect: The field should resolve to "g:\'docname'"

This occurs when the following conditions are both true:

 - There are multiple mapped connections to the same NetWare server but at
   different levels.

   Example:
   f: is mapped to \\"netware server"\public
   g: is mapped to \\"netware server"\public\user

 - DONTUSEUNC has been set in the registry.
