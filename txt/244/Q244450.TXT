The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: These procedures only apply if you have installed Outlook with 
the Corporate or Workgroup option. This option allows you to use Messaging 
Application Programming Interface (MAPI) services. To determine your 
installation type, on the Help menu, click About Microsoft Outlook. In About 
Microsoft Outlook, you should see "Corporate or Workgroup" if you have the 
Corporate or Workgroup installation.

This article describes a feature that is only available when you use the Exchange Server service in the profile.

SUMMARY
=======

If you use the Remote Mail filter feature of the Microsoft Outlook client, you
must be aware of the following important points:

 - When you configure the filter, all of the message headers are downloaded when
   connecting to retrieve new message headers. If a message that does not meet
   the filter criteria is marked for retrieval, the filter then keeps Outlook
   from downloading that message. If you want to see only the message headers
   that meet the filter requirement, use an Inbox Assistant server-based rule to
   move those messages out of the Inbox.

 - The configured filter setting is not applied if you select "Retrieve and send
   all new mail" in the Remote Connection Wizard. This behavior is by design.
   For the filter be in effect, you must select "Do only the following" in the
   Remote Connection Wizard.
