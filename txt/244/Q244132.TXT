PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5,4.0 SP6
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix kbbpqfe1a

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade a Microsoft DNS-based server from Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack
3 to Service Pack 4, 5, or 6, the System event log may contain one of the
following stop messages:

   Event ID: 453
   DNS Server sendto () function failed. The data is in error.

   -or-

   Event ID: 7053
   DNS Server sendto () function failed. The data is in error.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because DNS encounters a referral to an invalid address for
a name server. The referral resource record lists the IP address of the name
server as 0.0.0.0. DNS cannot send a query to an invalid address and logs the
error against the sendto function.
