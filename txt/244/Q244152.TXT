KEYWORDS:kbui fsim kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you fly the Mooney Bravo IFR in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000
Professional Edition, you may have a very limited view of the runway.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you are flying the Mooney Bravo IFR in Cockpit view.

The control panel on the Mooney Bravo IFR takes up approximately 80% of the
screen when you fly in Cockpit view. This use of screen space is necessary to
display all of the instruments on the control panel.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this issue by switching to the Mooney Bravo airplane. The
Mooney Bravo airplane does not have as large a control panel as the Mooney Bravo
IFR.

If you switch from the Mooney Bravo IFR to the Mooney Bravo you can see more of
the runway in Cockpit view, but there are fewer instruments on the control
panel.

To change your aircraft to the Mooney Bravo:

1. On the Aircraft menu, click Select Aircraft.

2. In the list of available aircraft, click Mooney Bravo, and then click the
   green check mark.
