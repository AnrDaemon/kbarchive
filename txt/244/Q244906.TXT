The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) Software Metering
feature in Offline mode to prevent users from starting programs, such as games
or a virus program, rather than just enforcing product license limits.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A list of forbidden programs can be downloaded to the clients on each
configuration cycle. These programs cannot run even when the client is in
Offline mode. Also, it is irrelevant as to whether or not the client can connect
to the license metering server.

To add a product to the list of forbidden programs, license the product, and then
delete its "Access times" value, so that there is no valid time in which this
program can run.

After the preceding configuration is downloaded to the client, the product cannot
start when requested.
