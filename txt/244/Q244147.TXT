======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Spot Plane view to look at your aircraft, the shadow of your
aircraft is not displayed. In addition, when you fly through a city, the shadows
of buildings are not displayed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design. This issue can be resolved by installing the latest
FS2000 update. You may find this update at this web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/games/fs2000

Flight Simulator now includes shadows for aircraft, buildings, and dynamic
scenery. The complete redesign of the scenery system in Flight Simulator 2000
made the previous method of displaying shadows obsolete. To view shadows, make
sure that the Aircraft Shadows and Ground Scenery Shadows settings are selected
in the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings dialog box. To get to this
dialog box in Flight Simulator, point to Options, point to Settings, and then
click Display. Then click the Image Quality tab.
