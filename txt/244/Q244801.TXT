-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), versions 2.0, 2.01, 2.1, 2.1 SP1, 2.1 SP2, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using a recordset with a server-side forward-only, or dynamic cursor and
binding to a textbox at run-time it is possible for the recordset to skip the
second record. The textbox will initially display the first record. A MoveNext
causes it to display the third record. With the dynamic cursor, a MovePrevious
will then display the second record correctly. This behavior is only exhibited
immediately after binding or after a ReQuery. This behavior is also shown if the
textbox is bound from the Data Environment.

RESOLUTION
==========

The recordset can be displayed correctly by reading one of the fields prior to
binding to the text box. For a run-time bound control, use the following code
prior to binding the textbox.

   Dim strTemp as String
   strTemp = rs(0)         'rs is the Recordset

When using the Data Environment, the only way around this problem is to bind the
textbox at run-time and use the workaround earlier. When you want to call the
ReQuery method, you should re-bind the recordset. The following code shows the
workaround with ReQuery.

   rs.ReQuery
   Dim strTemp as String
   strTemp = rs(0)
   Set Text1.DataSource = rs

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a New .exe Project.

2. Add the Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.x Library to your project.

3. Add a Textbox (Text1) and two Buttons (Command1 and Command2) to your form.

4. Add the following code to your project.

   Option Explicit

   Dim rs As Recordset

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
      With rs
         .MoveNext
         If .EOF Then
            .MoveLast
         End If
      End With
   End Sub

   Private Sub Command2_Click()
      With rs
         .MovePrevious
         If .BOF Then
            .MoveFirst
         End If
      End With
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()
      Dim cn As Connection
      Set cn = New Connection
      cn.CursorLocation = adUseServer
      cn.Open "DSN=Northwind"
      
      Set rs = New Recordset
      Set rs.ActiveConnection = cn
      rs.CursorType = adOpenDynamic
      rs.Open "SELECT EmployeeID FROM Employees ORDER BY EmployeeID"
      
      'Uncomment the next two lines to fix problem
      'Dim strTemp As String
      'strTemp = rs("EmployeeID")
      
      Set Text1.DataSource = rs
      Text1.DataField = "EmployeeID"
      
      Command1.Caption = "Next"
      Command2.Caption = "Previous"
   End Sub

5. Run the Project. The textbox displays the first record.

6. Click Next. The textbox will now show the third record.
