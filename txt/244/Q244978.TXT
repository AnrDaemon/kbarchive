KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have two Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers connected
to the network, and the DHCP Server Service of the unauthorized server is
running, it may intercept a 'Discover' broadcast from a client computer and
generate the following error message:

   The DHCP client could not obtain an IP address.

Also, Error ID 1003 may appear in the Event Log with the following description:

   DHCP failed to obtain a lease for the card with Network Address MAC address
   of client. Access is denied.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the network interface card (NIC) of the unauthorized
DHCP server is not intended to service the appropriate clients and prevents the
client from obtaining an Internet Protocol (IP) address. Because of this, the
DHCP Client Service does not start on the client computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, stop the DHCP Server service on the unauthorized server:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Services.

2. In the Service list, click Microsoft DHCP Server, and then click Stop.

3. Click Close.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent the DHCP Server Service from starting automatically:

1. In the Services dialog box, click Microsoft DHCP Server.

2. Click Startup.

3. Click Disabled or Manual, and then click OK.

4. Click Close.
