PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2000; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you log on to Terminal Server and have expired logon-hour restrictions, the
logon expiration warning appears to all users who are currently logged on to the
Terminal Server whether they are logged on at the console or through a session.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the warning is sent to the machine name of the
computer to which you have logged on.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the message does not contain any reference to your account, which has
the expired logon hours, the other connected users may think that they have
logon-hour restrictions.
