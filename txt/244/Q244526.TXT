MORE INFORMATION

To gain access to other types of transport stacks, the X.400 Connector must be
installed. It should be noted that the X.400 Connector is available on the
Microsoft Exchange Server Enterprise Edition CD-ROM disc or as a separate add-on
component to the Standard Edition, which must be purchased from Microsoft
Sales.
