SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates basing a DataReport on a parameterized DataEnvironment
and refreshing the report when the parameter value changes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Open a new Standard EXE Project in Microsoft Visual Basic. Form1 is created
   by default.

2. Add a DataEnvironment (DataEnvironment1) and a DataReport (DataReport1) to
   the project.

3. Add a Connection (Connection1) to the DataEnvironment pointing to NWIND.MDB
   (or Northwind.MDB) through the Microsoft Jet 4.0 OLE DB Provider.

4. Add a Command (Command1) to Connection1, with the following properties:

   CommandType: adCommandText
   CommandText: Select * From Employees Where HireDate < ?

In the Parameters tab:

   Name: pDate
   Direction: Input
   Data Type: adDBTimeStamp
   Host Data Type: Date (VT_DATE)

5. In the DataReport, set the following properties:

   DataSource: DataEnvironment1
   DataMember: Command1

6. Drag the following fields from the DataEnvironment into the Detail section of
   the DataReport:

   EmployeeID
   FirstName
   LastName
   HireDate

7. Add a TextBox (Text1) and a CommandButton (Command1) to the form. Add the
   following code:

   Option Explicit

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
     Load DataEnvironment1
     With DataEnvironment1
       If .rsCommand1.State <> 0 Then .rsCommand1.Close
       .Command1 CDate(Text1.Text)
     End With
     DataReport1.Refresh
     If DataReport1.Visible = False Then DataReport1.Show
   End Sub

8. Save the project and run it. Enter the following dates in the TextBox and
   click the CommandButton after each one:

   1/1/95
   1/1/94
   1/1/93
   1/1/92

   You can see the report refresh showing only those employees hired prior to the
   date entered.
