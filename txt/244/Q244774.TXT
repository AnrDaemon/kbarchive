TITLE   :HTTP Compression Deletes Contents of IIS Temporary Cache Files
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When HTTP Compression is configured for a maximum temporary folder size and that
folder size is exceeded, the entire contents of the temporary cache directory
are deleted and no further documents are cached until the service is restarted.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create a disk partition of the desired cache size,
and then change the HTTP compression settings to use that disk. This will cache
files until the disk partition is full, at which time no more documents will be
cached.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Services
version 5.0.
