SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to use the Bulk Import functionality of the Exchange
Server Administrator program to create mailboxes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a mailbox for an Exchange Server user by means of a .csv file, perform
the following steps:

1. Create a .csv file with the following heading:

   Obj-Class,
   Delivery-Mechanism,
   Directory Name,
   Alias Name,
   Home-Server,
   Primary Windows NT Account,
   First Name,
   Last name,
   Display Name,
   Obj-Container

2. Populate the columns with the appropriate information, for example:

   Mailbox,
   0,
   JohnD,
   JohnD,
   TESTSERVER,
   TESTSERVERDOM\JohnD,
   John,
   Doe,
   JohnDoe,
   /o=Organization/ou=TestSite1/cn=Recipients

   NOTE: The Obj-Class value must be Mailbox and the Delivery-Mechanism value
   must be 0 to create the mailboxes.

3. Perform a directory import to import the .csv file into the directory. (If
   you are creating the Windows NT account when you perform this import, under
   Account Creation, click to select the "Create Windows NT Account" check box.)
