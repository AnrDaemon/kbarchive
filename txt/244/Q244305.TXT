======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With an antivirus software package installed on your Exchange Server computer,
you may receive many instances of the following event in the application event
log:

   Event ID 1016
   NT User ExchService logged on to ExUser1 mailbox, and is not the Primary
   Windows NT Account on this mailbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some antivirus software requires you to create an account with Service Account
Admin permissions so the software can open all mailboxes and scan them. The
account created for the antivirus software with Service Account Admin
permissions is opening and scanning the mailboxes, and a 1016 event is logged
for each mailbox.

This behavior is by design. For additional information on the 1016 event, click
