TITLE   :Dr. Watson Error in CSRSS on Terminal Server Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbenv kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a connection from a client, a Dr. Watson error in CSRSS may be
generated on the Terminal Server computer. This causes a single session to not
connect.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of an initialization timing issue in CSRSS during
ClientThreadSetup. The first thread performs some of the initialization, but
other threads may enter the code even though the first thread has not yet
completed initialization.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 and
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.
