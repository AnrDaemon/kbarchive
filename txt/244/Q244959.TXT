SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to refresh a report in the SMS Administrator Console while you are
designing or viewing the properties of the report in Crystal Info Reports
Designer, you may receive the following error message:

   An error occurred communicating with APS

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the report is already open or in use by another program
such as Crystal Info Reports Designer. When the report file is open or in use,
attempts to open or use the same report by another program (such as SMS
Administrator Console) simultaneously are not permitted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, do not view a report in two different programs at the
same time.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
