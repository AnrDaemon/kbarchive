TITLE   :XIMS: IMAP4 Implementation Violates Licensing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 Internet Message Access Protocol, Version
4rev1 (IMAP4) clients can open more than one connection to an Exchange Server
computer. Administrators who support a large IMAP4 community may face a
licensing problem. Because the default licensing model for Exchange Server is on
a one-seat connection for each session basis, users may be denied access.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Outlook Express and non-Microsoft IMAP4 clients usually open a single
session to send and receive mail. They may open additional sessions for specific
operations such as folder manipulation.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the licensing mode for Exchange Server from
per-server-concurrent-connections to per-seat-connections. You may need to
purchase additional client access licenses (CALs).

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if the licensing mode for Exchange Server is set to per-server for
10 concurrent connections, and 5 Pine e-mail clients make a connection with 2
sessions for each connection, any other client that tries to connect is denied
access because of the lack of available licenses.
