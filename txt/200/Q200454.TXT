KEYWORDS:kbDataBinding kbMDAC kbOSP kbGrpDSVBDB kbMDAC260

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Errors may be reported by Visual Basic controls, such as the DataGrid, if schema
changes occur in the underlying data source where that data source is an OLE DB
Simple Provider (OSP). A schema change is not a change to the data provided, but
a change to the structure of that data. For example, adding or removing a column
from a table constitutes a schema change.

CAUSE
=====

Visual Basic controls, such as the DataGrid, do not receive the OLE DB
notifications required to process schema changes.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
