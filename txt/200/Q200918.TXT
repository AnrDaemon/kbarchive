TITLE   :SMSINST: The Application or DLL OLE2.DLL is Not a Valid NT Image
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms120 kbsmsInst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error is encountered when running a Systems Management Server
Installer executable:

   Bad Image - The application or DLL OLE2.DLL is not a valid NT image.

This error message can reference another .DLL file.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs if there is already a registered copy of the DLL on the system.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are four possible workarounds:

 - Remove any occurrences of the self-registering files from the Installer
   script if they were incorrectly captured during a repackage. Then repackage
   and test. You can check the Install.log for information on any self
   registering files.

 - Delete the pre-existing version of the DLL on the target clients. This will
   help eliminate possible conflicts during the package installation.

 - List the affected files in the Installer including Advanced Configuration,
   Options, and "System DLLs to exclude from Watch Application" and repackage.
   This will keep the Installer from including the problem files. This solution
   is not ideal if you are using this package to install updated files.

 - Switch from 32-bit to the 16-bit version of Installer. This message should
   not occur when using the 16-bit version of Installer.
