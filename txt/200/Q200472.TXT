The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may need to customize the header formation of the outgoing message from
Exchange Server to the host. By default, a dashed line (-) separator is drawn
under the Subject portion of the header. You may want to change this and this
article describes an undocumented feature to remove or change the line
separator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remove or change the dashed line separator underneath the Subject portion of
the header, follow these steps:

1. Open up the Exchconn.ini file located under the Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn
   directory. The exact location will be based on where the SNADS connector was
   installed.

2. Look for the [LME-SNADS-MEXDIA] section, you should find several parameters
   already defined here:

   [LME-SNADS-MEXDIA]

    title      = Exchange To SNADS Transform
    executable = lsmexdia.exe
    params     = &s
    outputq    = snads.in

3. Add the following line to this section to effectively remove the dashed-line
   separator:

   [LME-SNADS-MEXDIA]

    title      = Exchange To SNADS Transform
    executable = lsmexdia.exe
    params     = &s
    outputq    = snads.in
    lastline   =

   Or add a string value to this parameter to set the separator. By default, the
   SNADS connector will only output up to 78 characters, so if the string value
   supplied is greater than 78 characters (or what the 'hostnoterightmargin'
   value is in the [LME-SNADS] section) it will be truncated accordingly. The
   string value is not repeated, so if you want 78 asterisk (*) characters, you
   need to set lastline as follows:

   lastline =
   "******************************************************************************"

4. Stop and restart the SNADS connector. The dashes under the Subject line will
   now be removed, or changed to the specified value.
