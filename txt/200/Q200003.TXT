TITLE   :XFOR: Messages Sit in MS Mail Connector Queue and Event ID 2028
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Messages may accumulate in the message transfer agent (MTA) queue (the Microsoft
Mail Connector queue), and message flow from Exchange Server to the Microsoft
Mail postoffices may stop. In addition, the following error message may be
displayed in the application event log in the Windows NT Event Viewer:

   Event ID 2028
   Source MTA

   A fatal internal MTA error occurred. Contact Microsoft Product Support
   Services.

   Unable to encode the message tracking event. Event node = Vvt07, Error code =
   Mandatory node cannot be omitted [BASE XFER-IN 25 88](16)

Mail flow worked previously. This problem may occur after a Microsoft Mail server
has stopped responding.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Search for any error message in the application event log that includes the
   phrase, "Object at fault."

2. Using File Manager, delete the corresponding .dat file in the MDBData
   directory. For example, if you find the phrase "Object at fault 0600009B" in
   the application event log, delete the file Mtadata\DB00009B.dat.

3. At a command prompt, type:

   exchsrvr\bin\ mtacheck /v /f <log file name>.log

   This may also delete more DBxxxxx.dat files.

4. Restart the services; all the services start successfully.

5. Check the Micorosoft Mail Connector queue; all the messages are gone.
