SUMMARY
=======

SQL Server standard security means that in order to connect to a SQL Server
database, you must enter a user account and password. If you use the SMS Express
Setup option in SMS 2.0, the SA account is used to access the database. If you
use the Custom Setup option, SMS Setup prompts you to specify the account you
want to use when the system accesses SQL Server.

No other accounts are necessary, because Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
security controls access to the SMS site database. This is the maximum security
option.

Tip:

To maximize security, set an obscure password on the SQL SA account and do not
use it. Very few people should know this password. Create a different user
account with access only to the SMS site database within SQL Server, and use
that account in case anyone accesses the SMS site database directly. However,
direct access to the database is not necessary because of the SMS Site Database
provider in version 2.0.
