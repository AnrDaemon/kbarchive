SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to use the SQL Server 6.5 query tool to dump the
current Mapping Rules for version 3.2 of Linkage Directory Exchange (LDE) to
Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are times when you need to dump the current Mapping Rules of a Linkage LDE
environment to send to Microsoft PSS. To do so:

1. Start the SQL query tool, ISQL/w. Verify that LSDXMMD is the selected
   database.

2. Using ISQL/w, under the query window type "setuser DXAdmin" (without the
   quotation marks) and on the Query menu, click Execute. This sets the user to
   DXAdmin. If this does not complete successfully, the next step will not
   function properly.

3. Using ISQL/w, under the query window type "SELECT * FROM MapFields" (without
   the quotation marks), and on the Query menu, click Execute. In the Results
   window, it returns the current Mapping Rules for Linkage LDE. Save the
   results in an .rpt file called MapRules.rpt by clicking Save As on the File
   menu.
