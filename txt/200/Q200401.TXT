SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server 1.2 uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for socket-based
Remote Control sessions. UDP is a datagram-based protocol. It is an unreliable,
or best-effort protocol that does not verify that packets are not received out
of order, lost, or corrupted. Consequently, UDP-based Remote Control was prone
to connectivity problems.

With Systems Management Server 2.0, socket-based Remote Control now uses
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is a stream-oriented protocol. TCP
breaks the transmission into smaller sizes, retransmits lost packets, reorders
out of order packets, and filters any extra packets that might occur if the
transmission is faulty. Consequently, TCP is more reliable than UDP.

Remote Control performance across a wide area network (WAN) is improved in
Systems Management Server 2.0 over 1.x when using sockets-based Remote Control
because routers tend to give TCP packets a higher priority for transmission.
