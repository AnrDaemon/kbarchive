TITLE   :SMS: RC Being Accessed Icon Appears Inappropriately
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On Windows NT version 4.0 workstations, the Systems Management Server remote
control Being Accessed icon appears minimized on the taskbar. When it is
maximized, no controlling user is listed.

Attempts to quit the application fail.

The Windows NT Security log is empty, with no entry for remote control.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, restart the Windows NT remote control service to
remove the remote control icon.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.2 and 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The issue has been partially traced to the use of GroupWise. It is not
100-percent reproducible, but there are some consistencies.

The GroupWise utility Notify, when launched, can cause the remote control icon to
appear, as can launching a second instance of GroupWise.
