TITLE   :BUG: SMS 2.0 Shows No Version for an SMS Version 1.2 Child Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After upgrading a central site running Systems Management Server (SMS) 1.2 to
Systems Management Server 2.0, child and secondary sites running version 1.2 may
be displayed as a different version in the database of the upgraded central
site.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The Version and Build Number fields are introduced by Systems
Management Server version 2.0 and are stored in the Sites table of the version
2.0 database. The version information for sites running version 1.x is not
written to these new fields during the upgrade process. These fields are updated
once the new version 2.0 central site receives a site control file from the
version 1.x child and secondary sites, which should be completed within 24
hours.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
