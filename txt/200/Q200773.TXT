SUMMARY
=======

A Management Information Base (MIB) file for the Event to Trap translator has
not been created.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To permit your management program to be able to display received traps
correctly, you may have to create, or append to, a trap definition file. This is
a common reason for requesting an MIB file.

You can export events that are to be converted to traps, to a comma-delimited
text file. The purpose of the trap text file is to permit you to import the
configuration of traps to your SNMP console. To do so:

1. Open the Event to Trap translator on a client computer.

2. Click all events that are to be trapped on.

3. Click Export.

4. Click Trap Text in the "Save as Type" box.

The file is saved to the location you specified previously. Note that if you open
this file, you see records similar to the following:

1.3.6.1.4.1.311.1.4.1.18.83.77.83.32.82.101.109.111.116.101.32.67.111.110.116.114.111.108,
"SMS Remote Control", 6, 10, 7, "Remote user %1 from %2 is not permitted to
access this machine."

This can be interpreted as:

Enterprise Object Identifier (OID)
Event Source
Generic Trap No
Specific Trap No
No. of Varbinds (n)
VarBind 1 (Format String from DLL)
VarBind2...n

For information about how to create the trap definition file, please see your
respective SNMP Console vendor.
