    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

The Visual C++ compiler provides the /FA switch to generate an assembly file
(.asm) as part of the output although it may be possible to assemble this source
file without any errors. Microsoft does not recommend using a Macro Assembler;
that is, for example MASM, on the .asm files generated by the Visual C++
compiler. Such use of assembly files generated in this fashion is not supported
by Microsoft.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To generate an assembly file listing complete the following steps:

1. Select Project and click Settings.

2. Click the C/C++ tab.

3. Choose Listing Files for the category.

4. Select Assembly-Only Listing as the Listing File Type.

NOTE: Assembly files generated by the C/C++ compiler are for informational use
only.

Additional query words: MASM ML /FA
