TITLE   :SMSINST: Office 4.3 Uninstall Leaves Files and Folders Behind
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsmsInst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you remove Microsoft Office 4.3, some files or folders may be left on the
computer.

CAUSE
=====

All of the Office 4.3 programs can create files after you install the software.
These files will not be in the Install.log file and therefore will not be
removed when you uninstall the software. Also, any directory containing such
files will not be removed.

An example of this would be the Normal.dot and the Winword.opt files that
Microsoft Word creates the first time that it is run. Another example is a
document that was saved in any of the Office directories.

This behavior is by design to prevent data files from being deleted when you
remove the software.
