TITLE   :XCLN: How to Return X.400 Addresses with Outlook LDAP Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, the LDAP service (Ol98ldap.exe) client returns only SMTP addresses.

The Mapisvc.inf file can be modified on any computer with OL98LDAP.exe installed
to display the X.400 address instead of the SMTP address of the user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To modify the Mapisvc.inf file, do the following:

1. Exit and log off the Outlook 98 or Outlook 2000 client.

2. In Outlook 98, locate the Mapisvc.inf file in the <windir>\System or
   <windir>\System32 directory.

   In Outlook 2000, the default location for the Mapisvc.inf file is in the
   Program Files\Common Files\System\Mapi\1033\Nt directory.

3. Locate the EMABLT section in the Mapisvc.inf file.

4. Locate and change the following two entries:

   6605001e=X400
   6606001e=textEncodedORaddress

5. Start Outlook 98 or Outlook 2000 and add a new LDAP directory service in the
   Tools/Services/Add/Microsoft LDAP directory.

Note: The new Mapisvc.inf file settings do not take effect until a new LDAP
service is added to the profile. If an LDAP directory service was added to the
profile before the change was made in the Mapisvc.inf file, you must remove the
LDAP service and add it again.
