The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When uninstalling Systems Management Server (SMS), Network Monitor registry
entries are not removed. The location of the registry entries for Network
Monitor was not created by the SMS Setup program; and therefore are not removed
during an uninstall.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Network Monitor registry entries were created by the operating system.

See the following entries below:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Network Monitor
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineKeys\NetMon
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\bh
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\nm
HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-1175585662-1823761869-378935785-500\Software\Microsoft\Network Monitor

By design, only the System Management Server components that were installed by
the Setup program are removed during a uninstall.
