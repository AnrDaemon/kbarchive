TITLE   :SMS: Y2K Testing on SMS Site Server Causes Problems
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is not advised to perform Year 2000 (Y2K) testing on a live Systems
Management Server (SMS) site server, or the SMS's SQL server machine(s), because
this will break the SMS funtionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Changing the time/date on an SMS site server will be reflected in the site
control file that is sent to the SQL database. Once this file is written into
the database, SMS will be unable to process the next site control file.

When the date is changed back to "current" date/time and the site server writes
that to the database, SQL will not process this site file because the one with
the Y2K date is "newer." Thus, no information will go current for the site in
the database.

See Q154577 "Site Properties Cannot Be Changed," for more information.
