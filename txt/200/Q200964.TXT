TITLE   :SMS: Reasons Software Metering Server Fails to Install
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When installation of a software metering server fails, there are several areas
to troubleshoot.

Connectivity and Permissions
----------------------------

Verify that the License Server Manager on the Systems Management Server site
server has connectivity to the new software metering server. To do so, perform a
ping test using the NetBIOS name and then connect to the C$, D$, and Admin$
shares using a domain administrator account. Verify that the License Server
Manager account being used by software metering from the Systems Management
Server site server has administrative rights on the new software metering
server. This account must have administrative rights on the new server because
it will need to create file structures, services, and registry entries. For
additional information, see \Sms\Logs\Licsvcfg.log on the site server.

ODBC Compliance
---------------

Verify that the ODBC drivers on the software metering server are at least version
2.52. Confirm this by either checking the version of the drivers or by verifying
that the Install_ODBC process has completed successfully. License Manager
Service will not proceed with the software metering server installation until
the ODBC drivers are version 2.52 or newer.

Inbox and Service Creation
--------------------------

The License Server Manager should create the required inboxes on the target
server. Verify that these are present and were installed without problems by
looking in \Sms\Logs\Inboxmgr.log on the site server. Once the inboxes have been
created, License Server Manager completes the file transfer and installation,
creates the SMS_LICENSE_SERVER service on the target server, and starts the
service. Verify that this has taken place by checking \Sms\Logs\Licsrvc.log.

Additional information pertaining to the target server installation is found in
\Sms\Logs\Smsprov.log and \SMS\Logs\Sitectrl.log on the site server.
