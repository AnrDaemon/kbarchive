   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Installing Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 (SP1) on a computer running
clustering services provided by Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) release
candidate is not recommended. Setup may not work because the IrpStackSize
parameter is too small.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the following entry is created in the Windows NT application event log during
installation of Exchange Server 5.5 SP1, you can use a workaround to run
clustering services and SP1.

   ID: 2011
   Source: srv
   The server's configuration parameter "irpstacksize" is too small for the
   server to use a local device. Please increase the value of this parameter.

The workaround is to increase the value of the IrpStackSize parameter.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

 - If the following DWORD key exists in the registry, increase the current value
   by one.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\
   Lanmanserver\Parameters\IrpStackSize

 - If this registry key does not exist, add it to the registry, and set the
   value to 6.
