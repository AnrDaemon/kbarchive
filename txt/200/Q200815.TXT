SYMPTOMS
========

NOTE: The information in this article applies to Windows NT 4.0 on an Intergraph
TD300 150-MHz single-x86-processor workstation with an onboard AMD PCNET PCI
Ethernet network adapter.

When a program fills between 50 and 100 percent of physical memory and a large
file is copied from the computer to a network client, the NetBEUI stack may stop
responding (hang). When this occurs, the following symptoms may also occur:

 - The file-copy process stops.

 - Microsoft Windows 95 network clients are unable to connect to the computer.

 - No outbound connections can be made to network clients from the computer.

 - Event ID 9011 is generated on the server.

CAUSE
=====

The AMD PCNET PCI Ethernet network adapter driver that is included with Windows
NT 4.0 causes this problem.
