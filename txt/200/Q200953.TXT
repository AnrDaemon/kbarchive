-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Systems Management Server 2.0 is deployed in an existing Systems Management
Server 1.2 site, and Windows Networking Logon Discovery is enabled, Systems
Management Server 2.0 will enumerate all domain controllers in the domain and
create the SMSLOGON share on all domain controllers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Systems Management Server 2.0 Windows Networking Logon Discovery is enabled by
domain. Systems Management Server 2.0 will still allow client assignment to a
single subnet. All other clients on the domain will be discovered at logon, if
Windows Networking Logon Discovery is enabled, but only those clients in the
specified site boundary subnet will be assigned to the site. All the other
clients in the enterprise will run the discovery phase, and will be reported to
the site database. They will not receive any of the client agents, nor will they
be managed by the site.
