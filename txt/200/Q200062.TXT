TITLE   :XFOR: Hide Doesn't Remove User From MS Mail Global Address List
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Exchange Server administrator hides a user who participates in directory
synchronization (dirsync), the user is not removed from the Microsoft Mail (MS
Mail) global address list. If the administrator uses the Hide From Address Book
option in the user's Advanced property page, the user is still not removed from
the global address list.

This problem does not occur if a new user is created and hidden before dirsync
occurs. In this case, the user is not propagated to the MS Mail postoffice
global address lists.

CAUSE
=====

The Hide From Address Book option does not create a delete transaction for the
hidden user.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following three options to delete a user from the MS Mail global
address list:

 - Lower the trust level of the export container. When you alter the trust level
   on the dirsync export container, a full replace transaction
   (Rpcm:Exchnet/Exchpo) is sent to the MS Mail postoffices. The replace
   transaction consists of a delete transaction of all the users in the
   Recipient container, followed by an add transaction for all nonhidden users.
   You must do this for all the users in the container, because you cannot send
   an individual delete transaction.

 - Select the Export on Next Cycle option for the requestor.

 - On the MS Mail postoffice, start the MS Mail Administrator program, select
   Config, select Dirsync, select Requestor, and then select Import.

NOTE: If the MS Mail postoffice is the dirsync server, the third option above is
not available.
