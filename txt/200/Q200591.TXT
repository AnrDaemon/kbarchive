The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Report Control that is bound to a Visual Basic Data Environment
command object and perform a GroupBy, you receive the following error:

   8570 Report sections do not match data source

CAUSE
=====

One of the following has occurred:

 - The DataReport is bound to an ungrouped recordset.

 - The DataReport was created before binding the recordset.

RESOLUTION
==========

The ADO Command object that the report is based on needs to be modified for
grouping. Below is an example using Visual Basic 6.0's Data Environment and
grouping in a report. Note that the command is doing the grouping, NOT the
DataReport.

1. Create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a reference to Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.x Library.

3. Add a DataEnvironment.

4. Configure the Connection1 properties to use OLE DB Provider for SQL Server
   (SQLOLEDB) and the Northwind database (Nwind.mdb).

5. Add a Command object off of Connection1.

6. Configure the Command1 properties to use the Orders table and group by
   OrderDate (under the Grouping tab).

7. Add a DataReport to your project.

8. Set the DataSource to DataEnvironment1.

9. Set the DataMember to Command1_Grouping.

10. Right-click on DataReport1 and choose Retrieve Structure.

11. From the Summary Fields in Command1_Grouping, click and drag the OrderDate
   field into the DataReport1 Group Header.

12. Click and drag detail fields from the Detail Fields in Command1 into the
   DataReport1 Detail section.

13. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

14. Add the following code to Form1:

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       DataReport1.Show 1
       Unload DataReport1
   End Sub

15. Run the project and click Command1.

It is important that the report sections match the command object's structure. If
the error continues to occur, try using the Retrieve Structure command on the
DataReport to refresh the sections. Retrieve Structure will remove all fields
that are currently in the DataReport.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The example above assumes that you have a good understanding of how the
DataEnvironment, DataReport, and ADO work.

The key to fixing this problem is to make sure that the data sections match the
DataSource exactly. The most reliable way to do this is to use the Retrieve
Structure command on the DataReport.
