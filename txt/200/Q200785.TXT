The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Systems Management Server 2.0, the Site System Connection accounts are used
(instead of the Systems Management Server Service account) in Novell NetWare
environments by Logon Server Manager and Inbox Manager to connect to NetWare
site systems. In pure Microsoft Windows NT environments, these accounts are
optional.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each NetWare Bindery server, NetWare Data Services (NDS) container, and volume
must be accessible by at least one NetWare Site System Connection account. For
greater security, you can specify separate accounts for NetWare client access
points (CAPs) and distribution points.

NetWare NDS Site System Connection accounts must be created in both the Systems
Management Server Administrator console at the primary site server and on the
NetWare site systems. Each account must have Administrator permissions to the
NDS containers. NetWare Bindery Site System Connection accounts must have
Supervisor equivalence.

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
