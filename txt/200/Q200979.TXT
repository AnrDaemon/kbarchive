TITLE   :FIX: File Corruption Occurs When Shadowed
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0a,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400bug kbSSafe500bug kbSSafe600fix _IK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

File(s) in the shadow folder are corrupted.

CAUSE
=====

A carriage return in the file(s) are added only as a carriage return, rather
than as a carriage return and line feed pairs.

This happens when a shadow directory is set for a project and the shadowed files
are viewed before they are checked out and checked backed into Visual SourceSafe
(VSS).

RESOLUTION
==========

Checking the file(s) out, and then checking them back in should resolve this
problem once it has occurred.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Visual SourceSafe 4.0, 4.0a, and
5.0. This bug has been corrected in Visual SourceSafe 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new .txt file with a few lines of text separated by carriage
   returns.

2. Create a new project in the VSS Explorer.

3. Set a working folder for the project.

4. Add a file to the project.

5. Close VSS Explorer.

6. Run VSS Administrator.

7. Select Tools->Options->Shadow Folders tab.

8. Select BROWSE beside the "Set shadow folder for project:" edit box and select
   the project created in Step 2.

9. Click BROWSE beside the "Set shadow folder to:" edit box to select the
   location for the Shadow Folder.

10. Add "\test" to the end of the path in the "Name:" edit box.

11. Click OK.

12. Click Yes when prompted to create the new folder.

13. In the options dialog box set "File Date/Time" to 'Check-In'.

14. Click OK.

15. Close VSS Administrator.

16. Open the file in the shadow folder with a text editor. You can see an
   undefined character where a carriage return and line feed should be.
