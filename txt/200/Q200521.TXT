======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server Installer allows for the self-registration of a DLL or
OCX. If the DLL or OCX uses a long file name, the file name is converted to an
8.3 equivalent before being self-registered into the registry.

For example, if a file called "TwoPlusTwoEqualsFour.ocx" were installed on a
user's machine in the directory C:\ADD, the file would self-register under
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\<guid>\ as "C:\ADD\TWOPLU~1.OCX" instead of the
long file name.

CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server Installer converts DLL and OCX file names queued for
self-registration to short file names.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not self-register these files using Installer's Self-Register feature. For
each Install File script item that installs an OCX or DLL with a long file name,
make sure the Self-register OCX/DLL option is not selected within the script
item properties.

Alternatively, use Regsvr32.exe, a command line registration tool provided with
Microsoft Visual Studio 5.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 1.0. This has been fixed in Systems Management Server version
2.0.
