======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your Windows NT Server computer may occasionally log the following events in the
Event Viewer System log:

   Event ID: 2012
   Source: Srv,
   Type: Error
   Description: The server has encountered a network error.

The event may be generated when trying to log on from Windows 95 clients, who
will get the following error:

   The domain password you supplied is incorrect or access to your logon server
   has been denied.

The event may be generated when trying to connect to the domain controller
through Explorer or browsing through Network Neighborhood, and the response may
be:

   The network has responded incorrectly.

The event may be generated when trying to print to some of the printers queued on
the troubled domain controller, and will generate the following error:

   The system call level is not correct.

NOTE: You will be able to ping the IP address and NetBIOS name successfully to
and from the server displaying Event ID 2012.

CAUSE
=====

The following situations can cause these symptoms:

 - Your network interface card (NIC) may not be functioning correctly.

 - You may have an outdated or incompatible NIC.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do either of the following:

 - Replace the NIC on the server that is having the Event ID 2012 errors.

 - Contact the manufacturer of the NIC and get an updated driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Error 2012 in the Event Viewer, in general, indicated there is a connectivity
problem. It is advised to go through the normal connectivity troubleshooting
steps:

1. If the client is receiving one of the above error messages, a quick test to
   rule out something on the client side causing the problem would be to pause
   the NetLogon service on a domain controller with the 2012 errors. If the
   client is able to log on to another domain controller successfully, then the
   problem has been isolated to the server.

2. Check for the IPX protocol and the Btrieve applications on the server. For
   additional information, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

   Q195641 Btrieve, IPX, and Event ID 2012

3. Replace the network interface card (NIC) on the server with the Event ID 2012
   errors. The faulty NIC may be any variety of Token Ring or Ethernet.

4. Review the Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) to ensure that the
   NIC in the computer is on the HCL. If the card is not on the HCL, replace it
   with an HCL-compatible NIC.

5. Another known cause of connectivity problems is that the NIC driver may be
   outdated. Obtaining an updated driver from the manufacturer may resolve the
   issue.

6. The problem has also been seen with network switch problems that may be
   preventing the connectivity on an intermittent basis. Resetting the network
   switch may resolve the issue. Contact the switch manufacturer for detailed
   information on resetting your network switch.
