TITLE   :BUG: ComboBox Display Bleeds Through Pages in a PageFrame
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbContainer kbCtrl kbvfp500 kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you place a combo box control, which uses the InteractiveChange event to
programmatically activate the first page of the pageframe, on the second page of
a pageframe, when you select an item in that combo box the combo box display
image bleeds through to the first page.

RESOLUTION
==========

Here are two possible workarounds for this problem:

 - Use a Timer control to activate the first page.

 - Place code in the When event of the combo box to set its Visible property to
   false if the ActivePage of the pageframe is not the second page.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Place the following code into a Visual FoxPro program, and then run the
   program:

   DIMENSION laComboVals[2]
   laComboVals[1] = "Choice1"
   laComboVals[2] = "Choice2"

   oForm = CREATEOBJECT('TestForm')
   oForm.VISIBLE = .T.
   READ EVENTS

   **************************************
   DEFINE CLASS TestForm AS FORM
     ADD OBJECT pgfTest AS TestPageFrame

     PROCEDURE DESTROY
       CLEAR EVENTS
     ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS TestPageFrame AS PAGEFRAME
     TOP = 0
     LEFT = 0

     ADD OBJECT Page1 AS TestPage1
     ADD OBJECT Page2 AS TestPage2
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS TestPage1 AS PAGE
     ADD OBJECT Text1 AS TEXTBOX
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS TestPage2 AS PAGE
     ADD OBJECT cboTest1 AS TestCombo1 WITH ;
       TOP = 10
     ADD OBJECT cboTest2 AS TestCombo2 WITH ;
       TOP = 40
     ADD OBJECT cboTest3 AS TestCombo3 WITH ;
       TOP = 70
     ADD OBJECT Timer1 AS Timer1
       
     PROCEDURE CLICK
       THIS.cboTest2.VISIBLE = .T.
     ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS TestCombo1 AS COMBOBOX
     LEFT = 5
     ROWSOURCETYPE = 5
     ROWSOURCE = "laComboVals"

     PROCEDURE INTERACTIVECHANGE
       THIS.PARENT.PARENT.ACTIVEPAGE=1
       THIS.PARENT.PARENT.Page1.Text1.SETFOCUS()
       THISFORM.REFRESH()
     ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS TestCombo2 AS COMBOBOX
     LEFT = 5
     ROWSOURCETYPE = 5
     ROWSOURCE = "laComboVals"
     
     PROCEDURE INTERACTIVECHANGE
       THIS.PARENT.PARENT.ACTIVEPAGE=1
       THIS.PARENT.PARENT.Page1.Text1.SETFOCUS()
       THISFORM.REFRESH()
     ENDPROC
     
     PROCEDURE WHEN
       IF This.Parent.Parent.ACTIVEPAGE <> 2
         THIS.VISIBLE = .F.
       ENDIF
     ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS TestCombo3 AS COMBOBOX
     LEFT = 5
     ROWSOURCETYPE = 5
     ROWSOURCE = "laComboVals"

     PROCEDURE INTERACTIVECHANGE
       THIS.PARENT.Timer1.ENABLED = .T.
     ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS Timer1 AS TIMER
     INTERVAL = 10

     PROCEDURE TIMER
       THIS.PARENT.PARENT.ACTIVEPAGE=1
       THIS.PARENT.PARENT.Page1.Text1.SETFOCUS()
       THISFORM.REFRESH
       THIS.ENABLED = .F.
     ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

2. Select an item from each of the combo boxes on page two. The results are:

    - The first (topmost) combo box bleeds through to the first page.

    - The second combo box uses the When event solution so it does not bleed
      through to the first page.

    - The third combo box uses the Timer solution so it also does not bleed
      through to the first page.
