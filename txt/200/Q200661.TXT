TITLE   :XFOR: Event ID 2403: Failure Converting OLE v2 Object to OLE v1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbole exc4 exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message that contains an OLE version 2.0 object that can not be
converted to an OLE version 1.0 object from Exchange Server through the
Microsoft Mail Connector, the following event is logged in the application event
log:

   Event ID: 2403
   Category: Warning
   Source: MSExchangeMSMI
   Description:

   Failure converting OLE v2 object to OLE v1, OLE Object Class not registered in
   message C=US;A= ;P=Microsoft;l=BISCUITHEAD-970304034713Z-3.

You can still view this OLE object in Exchange Server clients. The Microsoft Mail
client does not display this OLE object.

WORKAROUND
==========

Install the OLE application on the Microsoft Mail Connector server.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Mail for PC Networks is an OLE version 1.0 compatible application. For
the Exchange Server client to embed OLE version 2.0 objects within a mail
message, the Microsoft Mail Connector interchange must convert the OLE version
1.0 object to an OLE version 2.0 object. This conversion occurs on the computer
running the Microsoft Mail Connecter interchange. For the Microsoft Mail
Connector interchange to convert the objects, the OLE application must be
installed on the Microsoft Mail Connector server, because the Microsoft Mail
Connector interchange uses the local registry to get the OLE information.
