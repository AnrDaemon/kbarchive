======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In some cases, the administrator of an Exchange Server computer may want to
alter the format used in generating e-mail proxy addresses, particularly for the
Lotus Notes, SNADS, and OV/VM (PROFS) connectors. This is accomplished by
altering the Address Type definitions within the Site Addressing object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, take the Lotus Notes proxy address generator. By default, Notes
proxy addresses are generated in the following format:

   Display Name/Exchange Site/Exchange Org@Exchange

You may want to change this addressing format to follow naming conventions used
within your organization. You can use variables in place of the defaults. The
following variables may be used within the Site Addressing object (case
insensitive):

   &M - The mailbox name or alias of the user.
   &I - The user's initials.
   &D - The user's display name (compressed to avoid white spaces).
   &G - The user's first name.
   &S - The user's last name.

Combinations of these can be used together, as well as a specific number of
characters from each group. To specify the number of characters used for a
particular variable, simply append a number on the end of the variable, as
follows:

   &S2 = The first two characters of the user's last name

See the examples at the end of this article.

To modify these settings for your Exchange Server site, follow the steps below:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program.

2. Select the Configuration container directly underneath your Site.

3. Double-click the Site Addressing object in the right pane.

4. Select the Site Addressing tab.

5. Select the Notes address, and click Edit.

6. Type in your new address format using the variables inidicated above.

7. Click OK.

At this time, you are asked if you would like all the existing Notes addresses to
be modified to reflect the changes within site addressing. If you select Yes,
the recipients within that site will inherit the new addressing format for their
Notes e-mail proxy addess.

Examples
--------

Name: Nancy M. Lee

   Site Addressing: &G@Exchange
   Result: Nancy@Exchange

   Site Addressing: &S&G&I/Microsoft@Exchange
   Result: LeeNancyM/Microsoft@Exchange

   Site Addressing: &S&G3@Exchange
   Result: LeeNan@Exchange

This modification to site addressing can also be done with the Exchange Server
SMTP proxy generator. For additional information on how to do this, please see
