TITLE   :OS/2 DHCP Clients Fail to Get Name Resolution or Communicate
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

SUMMARY
=======

An OS/2 Warp DHCP client may fail to get options such as Default Router (3) or
Name Server (6/44), and so on, from a Windows NT DHCP Server. However, it has no
such problems if a lease is granted from a OS/2 Warp DHCP Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A trace indicates that the OS/2 DHCP client does not request DHCP options from
the DHCP server. It is neccessary for DHCP clients to request the options they
want to obtain.

OS/2 DHCP clients, by default, request no DHCP options. To force OS/2 clients to
request specific options, edit the Dhcpcd.cfg client file. When the DHCP client
builds a DISCOVER or REQUEST, packet it reads the options listed in this file.

To direct the client to send its reguested options to a Windows NT DHCP server,
remove the remark sign in the lines for Default Router, Name Server, and so on,
and remove the "exec" statement behind the options, which is only valid for
OS/2-based DHCP servers.

According to RFC, if a DHCP client has not asked for options, a DHCP server
should not send any. Windows NT DHCP server follows the RFC.

Additional query words: dhcp options default router name server resolution OS/2 Warp dhcpcd.cfg
