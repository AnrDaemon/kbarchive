PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbsmsInst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Systems Management Server Installer script is compiled with WIN16/WIN32
as its destination platform and then executed on a computer running Microsoft
Windows 95, an Install Status MIF file may not be generated. This does not occur
on computers running Windows NT, nor does it happen with Installer scripts
compiled as True WIN32.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, compile your Installer executable selecting the
True WIN32 destination platform. This can be done from the Global tab within the
Advanced Configuration properties.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 1.0.
