======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) versions 1.2 and 2.0 Remote
Control function does not allow multiple remote control sessions of Microsoft
Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 on client computers running SMS 1.2 client software.
This is because of an internal limitation of the NetBIOS protocol and also, in
part, because of a NETBIOS and TCP/IP protocol conflict.

CAUSE
=====

SMS 2.0 is designed to support up to four remote control sessions on different
client computers when all connections are using TCP/IP. When NETBIOS is used for
remote control sessions, the SMS Administrator console can connect to and
initiate remote control sessions on only one computer at a time.

As long as the remote control protocol is configured to use TCP/IP only, any
Administrator console is able to initiate remote control sessions on up to four
computers simultaneously. However, as soon as one of the computers needs to use
NetBIOS, the number of available sessions is limited to one.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the first NetBIOS session is established, the special NetBIOS name
<machinename A> (padded to 15 characters) is obtained for the session
(<machinename> refers to the viewer). When a second session is attempted,
even on TCP, a NetBIOS connection is attempted regardless, because the system
tries all known protocols. However, the <machinename A> name cannot be
obtained.
