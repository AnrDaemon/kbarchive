TITLE   :SMS: Upgrading to SMS 2.0 When Packages Rely on MSTEST Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The MSTEST folder no longer exists in the Microsoft Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0 directory structure. In SMS 1.2, the path to this folder is
\sms\site.srv\maincfg.box\mstest.

The missing MSTEST directory might affect migration from SMS 1.2 to SMS 2.0. All
Packages built in SMS 1.2 that use files that are stored in the MSTEST directory
are unable to find these files when they are converted to SMS 2.0. As a result,
the package does not work.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you upgrade to SMS 2.0, you need to follow these steps to ensure that
packages dependent on files from the MSTEST directory continue to work
properly:

Before SMS 2.0 Upgrade

1. You need to move the files in the MSTEST directory (that the SMS package
   depends on) to the package source directory.

2. You need to send a job for the package that includes the Job Target and the
   Send Phase with the Even if Previously Sent option selected (you do not need
   to select the Distribute Phase and Run Phase). SMS recompresses the package
   file and includes the files that used to be in the MSTEST directory. This
   ensures that the package will work properly when it is converted during the
   SMS 1.2 to SMS 2.0 upgrade.

After SMS 2.0 Upgrade

There are two ways to ensure that the converted package works properly after an
SMS 2.0 upgrade:

 - Remove the converted package and re-create it using a package source that
   includes the files that used to be in the MSTEST directory. This is the
   recommended way to ensure that the package works properly.
 - Once the package has been decompressed to the SMS 2.0 Distribution Points,
   copy the files that used to be in the MSTEST directory to the package
   directory for the package.
