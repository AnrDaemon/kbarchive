SUMMARY
=======

Sometimes when administrators migrate users from Microsoft Mail to Exchange
Server, the mailboxes migrate with no errors, but neither administrators nor
users can log on to the new Exchange Server mailboxes. This occurs with both
single-step and two-step migration, where administrators are telling the
Migration wizard to make passwords from the alias names.

Usually, the administrator must enter a new password under User Manager for
Domains in order to access the mailboxes.

There are no problems with the password generation of the Migration wizard. The
common cause for this issue is a minimum password length set for the Windows NT
domain, which is a larger number than the alias name of the migrated user. In
these cases, the Migration wizard pads the password with lowercase "x"s. The
password can be found in the Accounts.password file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An example is a mailbox whose alias name is three letters long, like the
initials of the user. This mailbox is migrated to Exchange Server, whose domain
has a minimum password length of four. When the administrator (or user) attempts
to log on to the new mailbox, he or she is denied with a "password incorrect"
error message. To get into the mailbox, the administrator must either reset the
password under User Manager for Domains, or enter the password with enough
following "x"s to match the minimum password.
