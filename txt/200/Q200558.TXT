The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server 2.0, if you click Remote Tools and then click File
Transfer, the File Transfer window does not divide the two panes evenly, as it
did in previous versions of Systems Management Server. One pane is always larger
than the other.

WORKAROUND
==========

To make the panes the same size, you can manually adjust them.

======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
