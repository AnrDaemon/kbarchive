======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Microsoft Systems Management Server Network Monitor (Netmon) is running on
a token ring segment, mainframe clients on that segment may no longer be able to
access or connect to a mainframe host computer. As soon as Netmon is started on
a client of a mainframe somewhere in the Token Ring network, all new sessions to
the mainframe will fail and the mainframe becomes unavailable to all clients on
the token ring network.

CAUSE
=====

The computer (running either Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 95) on which Netmon is
running has a Madge PCI Ringnode Token Ring network interface card (NIC) with
Mdgmport.sys of version 5.02. When this adapter is set in Promiscuous mode
(required for Netmon to monitor all network traffic), the driver will actually
de-insert LLC XID frames from the ring.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade the Madge NIC driver from to 6.0 or newer.
