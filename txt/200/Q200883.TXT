TITLE   :XWEB: Netscape OWA Client Displays Incorrect Language Text
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When accessing Outlook Web Access (OWA) using a Netscape Navigator Web browser,
you may see the text display in a language not consistent with the primary
language of the client or server computers. This can happen if you have applied
the incorrect Exchange Server service pack to the Exchange Server computer. For
example, if you have a computer running Exchange Server version 5.5 (U.S.
English Version) and install Service Pack 1 for Exchange Server (German
version), Netscape Navigator Browser OWA clients may display German text, even
after you apply the U.S. English version of Exchange Service Pack 1.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use Netscape Navigator OWA clients again, you must restore the Exchange
Server installation from a backup made prior to applying the incorrect service
pack version.

WORKAROUND
==========

OWA clients can use a browser other than Netscape Navigator without this effect.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook Web Access
version 5.5 Service Pack 1.
