======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the functions and limitations involved when you use Server
Locations in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can only have one entry in the Server Location section on the <Server>
Properties in the Exchange Administrator program.

Users can access public folder replicas more efficiently if you group servers
within a site into locations. You can also use locations to limit the scope of
users who can access the services of a connector.

Exchange Server automatically searches for public folder replicas within its own
location. If it can't locate the public folder replica in its own location, it
searches servers outside of the location. If you want users to access public
folder replicas on certain servers by default, you can create a wildcard
location called asterisk (*). Exchange Server searches for public folder
replicas on * servers unless you've specified another location for accessing the
public folder replicas. To create a wildcard location:

1. Type or select the name in the Server Location box.

2. To add a server to *, type an asterisk, "*" (without the quotation marks) in
   the Server Location box.
