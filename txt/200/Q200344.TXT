SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server 2.0 now uses TCP/IP subnets or IPX networks to define
the site boundaries, rather than Windows NT domains. If the site server is a
domain controller, the subnet of the site server is used by default.

When the TCP/IP subnet for the site boundary is entered into the site properties,
a subnet mask is not needed. The client's subnet mask is used to determine if
the client resides within the site server's boundaries.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the network that the Systems Management Server Site resides on is using
subnet masks to segment the network throughout the enterprise, each subnet must
be entered into the Site Boundaries tab.

For example, if the default site boundary is set to 198.162.157.0, and you have
two clients configured as follows:

   Client 1
   IP address : 198.162.157.19
   Subnet mask: 255.255.255.128

   Client 2
   IP address : 198.162.157.132
   Subnet mask: 255.255.255.128

Client 1 would reside inside the site boundaries, and therefore be assigned to
the Systems Management Server site. Client 2 would not be a member of the site.

This is due to the fact that with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.128, you get two
subnets: 198.162.157.1-127, and 198.162.157.130-254, with two subnet IDs of
198.162.157.0 and 198.162.157.129. The only subnet listed in the site boundary
is 198.162.157.0.

To make Client 2 reside within the site, you would have to add the other subnet
to the site boundary table. In this example, you would add 198.162.157.129.

For more information, look under "Site Boundaries" in the Systems Management
Server 2.0 Administrator's Guide index.
