TITLE   :NetWare Client 4.5 Does Not Pass Terminal Server Home Path
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocfix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the NetWare 4.5 client (this client is Windows Terminal Server
aware), the user's HOME path environment is not passed to the operating system.

Many login scripts rely on this variable.

CAUSE
=====

When you use the Windows NT client v 4.5 and initiate a Terminal Server
connection through Windows 95 or Windows NT Terminal Server Client, the login is
sucessful but the HOME_PATH variable is not set. This variable should be set to
the same path that is set for the user's Terminal Server home directory. In
addition, the Terminal Server profile path is not read.

Novell cannot address this issue until the new fields are made avilable to them
through an API call. Currently, the API does not exist.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition that contains this
fix.
