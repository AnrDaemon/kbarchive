TITLE   :SMS: If the Temp.Tcf File Is Deleted, CCIM May Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0; winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbDiscovery smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server 2.0, if Manual Discovery and Installation is the
only installation method, and the Temp.tcf is deleted or renamed, Client
Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) will fail to run discovery until
Systems Management Installation Wizard (SMSMAN) is run again.

You will see the following errors in the Ccim.log file:

   ERROR: No discovery methods were found in the .tcf file.
   ERROR: Unable to collect discovery data, CollectDiscoveryData returned
   2147483656
   CCIM16 - Retry in 10 minutes

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The startup process reads the appropriate .tcf file at the logon point, and
creates the local version on the client. Note that the file is modified with
client specific information. As long as a user logs on and runs the Systems
Management Server logon script (SMSLS), or manually runs SMSMAN or SMSMAN16, the
.tcf file will be regenerated and CCIM will discover as normal.
