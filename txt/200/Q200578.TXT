-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to step over a function that contains a data breakpoint anywhere
in its execution path and the data expression does not evaluate to true, the
Developer Studio debugger may step into the function or appear to hang.

CAUSE
=====

The RISC implementation of the breakpoint handler fails to differentiate between
normal breakpoints and data breakpoints, and handles the data breakpoints
incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable or remove all data breakpoints when stepping through code.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Data breakpoints are discouraged on Windows NT RISC platforms because most of
these architectures don't support debug breakpoint registers, resulting in
extremely poor performance.
