TITLE   :XFOR: Messages in Draft Folder Lose Draft Flag after Migration
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the IMAP4 Migration wizard to migrate messages from an IMAP4 mail
server, messages in the Drafts folder may lose the Unsent flag after migration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This occurs because some IMAP4 clients do not properly set the Draft flag on
messages in the Drafts folder. Some clients treat any message in the Drafts
folder as a draft message without checking for or setting the Draft flag. When
messages are migrated from this folder, they will appear as sent messages in
Exchange Server.
