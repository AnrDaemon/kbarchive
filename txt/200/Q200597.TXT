TITLE   :BUG: Debugger Cannot Step Out of Recursive Function
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0

KEYWORDS:kbDebug kbide kbVC500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: DEC Alpha 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: DEC Alpha 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to step out of a recursive function that has called itself may result
in no action by the Visual C++ debugger.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the debugger's inability to differentiate between the
current address context and the return address context if the addresses are the
same. As a result, the debugger interprets the current address as the step-out
breakpoint and breaks immediately without executing any instructions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, for each step-out, just perform a step-over to make
the current address different than the return address, then perform a step-out.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
