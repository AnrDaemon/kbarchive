======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Bulleted or numbered lines of text in a Word 97 document may appear incorrectly
when the document is opened in Word 6.0/95. Specifically, lines in the list in
which the bullet or number was removed appear as bulleted or numbered again.

This problem occurs when all of the following are true:

 - The list is formatted with a custom style.

   -and-

 - The custom style's definition contains a Bulleted, Numbered, or Outline
   Numbered format.

   -and-

 - The bullet or number was removed from blank lines in the Word 97 document.

   -and-

 - The document is saved in Word 97 document format.

   -and-

 - You open the Word 97 document directly in the earlier version of Word by
   using the Word 97/2000 text converter.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, save your Word 97 document in the Word 6.0/95 file
format. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Word 97, open the file that contains the custom style numbered
   list.

2. On the File menu, click Save As.

3. In the Save As dialog box, change the "Save as type" box to Word 6.0/95, and
   then click Save.

   NOTE: You may want to type a new file name in the "File name" box, so that
   your original Word 97 document is not overwritten with the Word 6.0/95 file
   format.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
