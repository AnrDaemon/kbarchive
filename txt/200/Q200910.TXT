SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install the Microsoft Network Monitor tool
(NetMon) on a computer that is running Windows 95 or Windows 98.

Network Monitor is available on the following Microsoft BackOffice CD-ROMs:

 - BackOffice version 2.5 on CD-ROM 4, in the SMS12\NMext\Disk1 folder.

 - BackOffice version 4.0 on CD-ROM 5, in the SMS\NMext\Disk1 folder.

 - BackOffice version 4.0 on CD-ROM 6, in the SMS20\NMEXT\I386 folder

NOTE:These locations will correspond to where they are found on the respective
versions of SMS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install Network Monitor, run the Setup program from one of the following
locations:

 - From the Disk1 folder where Netmon.zip was expanded.

 - From disk 1 of the three Network Monitor Setup disks.

 - From the Disk1 folder in the locations mentioned above on the Back Office
   CD-ROM.

After the Setup program finishes, you are prompted to install the supporting
Network Monitor drivers. To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Network. (This step is necessary only if the Network Properties dialog box is
   not displayed at the end of Network Monitor Setup).

2. Click Add, double-click Protocol, and then click Have Disk.

3. Click Browse.

4. Browse to the following folder (depending on your operating system version):

    - Windows 98 CD-ROM: CD-ROM drive:\Tools\ResKit\NetAdmin\NetMon

    - Windows 95 CD-ROM: CD-ROM drive:\Admin\NetTools\NetMon

5. Click OK, and then restart the computer when you are prompted.

To ensure proper parsing of Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) packets:

1. Using a standard text editor (such as Notepad), edit the Tcpip.ini file
   located in the Parsers folder in which Network Monitor is installed. The
   default location is C:\Nm\Parsers.

2. Locate the [TCP_HandoffSet] section.

3. Locate the line containing the text "5678 = PPTP" (without the quotation
   marks). Change this to "1723 = PPTP" (without the quotation marks).

4. Save the file, and then quit Notepad.
