SUMMARY
=======

After you create a Web page that uses the FrontPage Save Results component to
save the information from a form to a file on the server, it is possible to
determine the name of the file by reading the HTML source and then opening the
file remotely via the Web browser.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All of the configuration information that FrontPage uses in the Save Results
component is encoded directly into the HTML file, as opposed to a separate
configuration file. Anyone viewing the HTML document with a browser capable of
viewing the HTML source can read the configuration parameters of the Save
Results component.

As a result, when you create a Save Results component in an HTML file,
unauthorized browsers can read the file name of the file containing your
results.

When you use a Save Results component to store sensitive information from a
publicly viewable Web page, Microsoft recommends storing the results file in a
hidden directory. Although storing files in the _private folder does not make
them inaccessible, it prevents these pages or their contents from being found
using search capabilities in FrontPage.

Hidden directories are directories that begin with an underscore "_" character.
These directories can be named anything such as "_vbscript", "_sample",
"_hidden", and so on.
