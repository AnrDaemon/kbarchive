KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fixkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.0a

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT Server with Service Pack 4 experiences a STOP 0xC000021a error when
you run the Windows NT Resource Kit utility, pviewer.exe, or any performance
utility that attempts to gather "costly counters" against it. Costly counters
are a set of four data items that can be retrieved; for example, thread details,
process image names that take extra processing to get the data for.

CAUSE
=====

The Winlogon process causes an access violation with a C0000005 error, which in
turn causes the trap.

RESOLUTION
==========
