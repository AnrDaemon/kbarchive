KEYWORDS:kbtool kbRemote kbsms kbHelpDesk kbRemoteProgkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SMS Remote Control Agent service running on Microsoft Windows NT Systems
Management Server-based client computer requires access to the desktop. This is
enabled by default and should not be changed to ensure proper functionality. If
you change the SMS Remote Control Agent service properties so that it can not
interact with the desktop, the Quick Viewer Window displays a black screen and
not the client computer's actual desktop.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Start the Services tool in Control Panel, and then view the Startup section
   of the SMS Remote Control Agent.

2. Enable the "Allow Service To Interact With The Desktop" feature, stop and
   then restart the service.
