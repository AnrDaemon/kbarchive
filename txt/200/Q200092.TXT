TITLE   :XIMS: Internet Mail Service Fails to Start on DEC Alpha, 4087
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A DEC Alpha with Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 installed may experience problems
after you add Gateway Services for NetWare and the Microsoft Exchange Connector
for Lotus cc:Mail. The Internet Mail Service may fail to start, and an error in
the event viewer may appear indicating the following:

   ID: 4087, Source: MSExchangeIMC, Type: Error,

   "Service could not be started. Queue viewing interface could not be
   registered"

Removing the connector to cc:Mail and removing the Gateway Services for NetWare
does not solve the problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following actions are suggested in this order given below:

1. Confirm that the version of Windows NT is a release-to-market (RTM) version
   clean installation (not over a Beta version).

2. Confirm that Services for Apple Talk is not running on this Microsoft Windows
   NT Advanced Server (NTAS) computer.

4. Remove all the network protocols except TCP/IP, and then reboot the
   computer.

   Note: Always reapply Windows NT service packs when adding protocols.

5. In Task Manager or Performance Monitor, confirm that the Internet Mail
   Service has started.

6. If it starts successfully, and stays up without errors, send an SMTP message
   through the Internet Mail Service to confirm proper operation.
