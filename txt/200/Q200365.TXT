TITLE   :XFOR:Regulating Free/Busy Updates for Selective Custom Recipient
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Because of network restrictions or bandwidth issues, it may not be feasible for
the Microsoft Exchange Calendar Connector to perform a complete calendar
synchronization for all custom recipients in the site. This article describes a
technique to selectively update free/busy data for these custom recipients
without generating a large amount of traffic on your network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can create a Distribution List within the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program to represent a subset of your custom recipients. By
creating a limited subset of custom recipients, you can stagger the free/busy
updates and avoid a potential backlog in the network. You would simply send a
free/busy request for that particular DL, and the Calendar Connector will then
update the free/busy information for those users in that DL.

Additional query words: network bandwidth, calendar connector, workaround
