TITLE   :Routing Problems After Installing Checkpoint Firewall 1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT system does not forward packets, even though the Enable IP
Forwarding check box is selected in TCP/IP Properties.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur because Checkpoint Software's Firewall 1 software has
been installed and no routing security policy has been configured by the user
after installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, configure a security policy or disable the control of
IP forwarding by Firewall 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If no security policy has been configured, Firewall 1 assumes the most
restrictive policy, which is no forwarding of IP packets.
