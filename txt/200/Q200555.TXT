SUMMARY
=======

MFC provides localized versions of the standard OLE color, font, and picture
property pages. This article provides two methods for using these resources in
MFC property pages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first way to use these resources is by installing the MFC resource only DLL
which is localized for the desired language on the system. For additional
information on using the MFC resource only DLLs please see Technote 57 (TN057)
titled "Localization of MFC Components"

   Q208983 Using MFC's LOC DLLs

In cases where using the MFC4xLOC DLL is not a viable alternative the only other
solution is to create a customized property page that can be localized. This
encompasses the following steps:

1. Copy the stock property page dialog resource from the appropriate localized
   MFC resource only DLL (usually found in mfc\include\Afxctl.rc). You can
   rename the ID if you like.

2. Using Class Wizard and the new dialog resource ID, create an OLE property
   page class derived from CStockPropPage (don't forget to provide a string ID
   for the page and its caption). If you get a Class Wizard error about being
   unable to open a file, just ignore it.

3. Copy the code from the corresponding MFC class representing the stock
   property page. For example, if you were customizing the CFontPropPage dialog
   box, you'd copy the code from mfc\src\ppgfont.cpp and mfc\include\afxctl.h.
   Some modifications will be necessary.

    - Change the class name to your new OLE property page class. For example,
      change all occurrences of CFontPropPage to CMyLatinFontPage

    - Use the new CLSID provided by Class Wizard in IMPLEMENT_OLECREATE_EX

    - Use the two new string IDs for the page and caption

    - It may be necessary to include some private MFC headers

      #include <afxpriv.h>
      #include "../src/oleimpl2.h"
      #include "../src/afximpl.h"
       

4. As with adding any OLE property page, make sure to add the entries into the
   BEGIN_PROPPAGEID macro in the control's implementation file. For example:

      BEGIN_PROPPAGEIDS(CSuperCtrl, 2)
   	PROPPAGEID(CSuperPropPage::guid)
   	PROPPAGEID(CMyLatinFontPage::guid)
      END_PROPPAGEIDS(CSuperCtrl)

The reason that the creation of a customized property page is necessary is that
the function calls for the creation and usage of resources does not originate
from the application when creating stock property pages, the function calls
originate from the COM subsystem. The module state used to determine where to
load the resources is the calling user module. This means the resources in the
user module and extension DLLs (which could be resource only DLLs) are used.
Therefore the resources used by the stock property pages are restricted to
resources in the MFC DLL.
