TITLE   :Chat MMC is Unable to Save View with Two or More Expanded Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) with the Chat snap-in,
administrators who have more than one server expanded in the view will be unable
to save the console settings with all servers expanded.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design as both servers will still be in the saved settings,
but only the last-used server entry will be expanded.

Additional query words: mcis chat mmc
