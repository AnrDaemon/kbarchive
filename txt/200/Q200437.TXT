TITLE   :SMS: Status MIFs Are Generated with .MIF.MIF Extension
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms120 kbsmsInst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0.45 to create a
status MIF and specify the MIF file name as MyFile.mif, the resulting MIF file
might be saved as MyFile.mif.mif. This only occurs with executables compiled as
True Win32. Executables compiled as WIN16/WIN32 do not add the extra .mif
extension to the output file.

If you specify the MIF file without the .mif extension, you create the correct
MyFile.mif.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem when you compile as True Win32, remove the .mif
extension when you specify the Install MIF Filename in the SMS tab of the
Installation Properties dialog box. SMS Installer adds the .mif extension to the
base file name and generates a valid MIF file name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 1.0. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
