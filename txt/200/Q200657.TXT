TITLE   :SMS: Character Display Limit in Status Viewer Description Field
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When viewing a status message in the Status Message Viewer of Systems Management
Server (SMS) version 2.0, the message may appear truncated. However, the
complete message can be displayed in the Tool Tip dialog box by moving the
pointer over the message.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server version
2.0 for Windows NT.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The maximum number of characters that can be displayed in the
Description field is 256. (The maximum length of the list is actually 3200
pixels, so the number of characters displayed can be affected by the font
selected.)

WORKAROUND
==========

Double-click the message to display the entire message.

You may be able to alter the number of characters by changing the font used.
