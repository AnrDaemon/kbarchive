-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Studio versions 6.0, 6.0 SP1, SP2, 97, 97sp1, 97sp2, 97sp3 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Localized MFC resources are available for most major international languages;
however, MFC Wizards are not available for certain countries. Furthermore, the
corresponding localization resource-only DLLs are not redistributable. It is
possible, however, to target other national languages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, the Portuguese and Russian versions of MFC42 are not available in
Visual Studio. Only the following languages are supported for MFC42 DLLs at the
present time:

 - Chinese (Simplified)

 - Chinese (Traditional)

 - English

 - French

 - German

 - Italian

 - Japanese

 - Korean

 - Spanish

The development team is currently considering supporting other languages; if that
is the case, this article will be updated. Microsoft recommends that developers
use the English version for languages that are not included in the above list.
Other national languages can still be targeted, because the MFC42loc.dlls for
those languages have been installed with updated localized target systems (that
is, after installing the latest service packs under Microsoft Windows NT or the
latest update to Microsoft Internet Explorer or Microsoft Office, under Windows
95, or Windows 98). After being created, those resources should be marked with
the appropriate language (and the strings translated as needed). Some manual
editing of the resource compiler *.RC file might be needed in some cases.
