-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To be able to remotely control a computer, that computer must have the Systems
Management Server (SMS) Remote Control agent installed. For the Remote Control
agent to be installed, it must be enabled for the site from the SMS
Administrator console. Then, the SMS Client software must be installed on the
target computer.

To install the Client software, you can use the Smsls.bat logon script, you can
perform a manual installation by using Smsman.exe, or for Microsoft Windows
NT-based computers you can use Windows NT Remote Client Install.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have enabled Remote Control for the site and installed the SMS client
components, you can install Remote Control on the client workstation. In some
environments installation may take as long as 10 minutes. Because the actual
installation of Remote Control is silent, use either Taskman.exe (Microsoft
Windows 95/Microsoft Windows 98) or Task Manager (Windows NT) to note when the
Remctrl.exe package runs. Remote Control is the last of the components to be
installed on the client. After Remctrl.exe appears, it runs for 30-60 seconds
and then disappears from the Process list. Remote Control is then installed on
the client workstation, completing the client component installation.

To confirm that the client has received and installed the Remote Control
components, check for the existence of the Install.log file in the
<Drive>:\<Windows_folder>\MS\SMS\Clicomp\RemCtrl folder. The
existence of the Install.log file indicates that the client component
installation was successful. You can also use this file to determine whether the
Remote Control components were successfully installed.

The Remctrl.log file in the <Drive>:\<Windows_folder>\MS\SMS\Logs
folder is a more detailed log file that contains an "Install Complete" message.
The existence of the Install.log file and the completion message at the bottom
of the Remctrl.log file indicates a successful Remote Control installation.

You should restart the workstation to correctly start the appropriate Remote
Control Client agent. Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT have low-level
operating system-specific drivers that must be loaded for full Remote Control
functionality to be present. Just starting the correct program on the client is
not sufficient to start all of the Remote Control functions after the background
installation of the components has taken place.

In Windows 95 and Windows 98, a "DEVICE=" line is added in the [386 Enh] section
of the System.ini file to load the Vuser.386 helper driver. This driver is not
loaded until you restart the client computer. Without this driver, full-screen
MS-DOS sessions and some keyboard stuffing does not operate correctly during a
Remote Control session.

In Windows NT, the KBStuff and RCHelp services must be loaded. Without these
services, keyboard stuffing of ALT+key sequences does not work (for example,
CTRL+ALT+DELETE, ALT+TAB, and so on).

Although the installation of the Remote Control component is silent, full
functionality on the client does not exist until you reboot the workstation.
When you reboot the workstation, the Remote Control agent is started and begins
"listening" through a specific protocol for a Remote Control request. This agent
is the core of all the Remote Control functions.

The SMS Remote Control agent on clients that are running Windows 95/Windows 98 is
called Wuser32.exe. You can start it automatically after the Remote Control is
installed by rebooting the computer, or you can start it manually by running
Wuser32.exe in the <Windows_folder>\MS\SMS\CliComp\RemCtrl folder.

The SMS Remote Control agent on Windows NT-based computers is also called
Wuser32.exe. You can start or stop it by using the Services tool in Control
Panel, or by using "net start" and "net stop" commands. When you use "net start"
and "net stop" commands, you can specify either the full name (SMS Remote
Control Agent) or Wuser32.exe.
