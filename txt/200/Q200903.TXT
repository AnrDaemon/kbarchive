The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you make a folder in a FrontPage Web executable, you notice that the Allow
Scripts or Programs To Be Run option in not available (it is grayed out).

MORE INFORMATION
================

This can occur if you have a disk-based-web open in FrontPage Explorer. You will
need to host this web on a Web server to have the option.

NOTE: The NoexecutableCgiUpload=1 parameter in the frontpg.ini file could also
cause this problem.

To find out if you have a disk-based-web open, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu in FrontPage Explorer, click Web Settings.

2. On the Configuration tab, you will notice a file location path. If this path
   starts with a drive letter, you have a disk-based-web open. A server-based
   web will have a Web server path with http://.
