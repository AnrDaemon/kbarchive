======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Database integrity is essential to any Systems Management Server site database
if it is to operate smoothly and efficiently. In Systems Management Server 2.0,
administrators can use the Conv20.exe utility to check for and repair any SMS
database integrity issues.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Conv20.exe utility is primarily used to convert the SMS database from the
schema of Systems Management Server 1.2 to that of version 2.0. During this
conversion, Conv20.exe checks the integrity of the database and makes sure that
triggers are in place. This utility can also be run on an existing Systems
Management Server 2.0 database.

When you initiate the Conv20.exe program, a screen requesting the following
information appears: Server Name, Database, Logon ID, and Password. After typing
the correct information into these four fields, Conv20.exe will check (and
restore if necessary) stored procedures, triggers, tables, views, columns, and
the default collections and queries (that is, everything in the SMS database
that is installed by Systems Management Server Setup).

To run this utility from a command line, use the following switches.

+--------------------+
| /S | Server name   | 
+--------------------+
| /D | Database name | 
+--------------------+
| /U | User name     | 
+--------------------+
| /P | Password      | 
+--------------------+

You can run the Conv20.exe utility on any Systems Management Server 2.0 database
where corruption is suspected. The utility will find and replace any triggers or
stored procedures that are missing or corrupted. It will also check for all the
triggers that maintain relational integrity, and rebuild them if they are not
there.
