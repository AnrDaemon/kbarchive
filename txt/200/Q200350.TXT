TITLE   :HPMON Generates Event ID 1012 When Using DLC Protocol
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view your Windows NT Event logs, you may come across Event ID: 1012.
The source for the event ID is HPMON.

CAUSE
=====

This error is generated in rare conditions or when the network is either
overloaded or slow. The error can be an indication of problems with network
traffic, network hardware and/or hardware drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a general rule, the operating system is not usually the cause of the error.
It is more likely that the error is being driven from one of the following.

 - Network routing, switching, logical addressing, and datagram services.

 - Data link transmission control and error detection.

 - Physical, electrical, mechanical, and functional interfaces.

The following settings can be altered to reduce the amount of DLC errors logged
in the event log by HPMON. To make these changes, follow these steps:

1. Go to Print Manager.

2. Select any printer that uses a DLC port.

3. On the Printer menu, click Properties.

4. On Printer Properties, verify the port that the printer uses is a DLC port.
   If not, select another printer that is using DLC.

5. Click Settings and go to Timers and Status Update. Set this to 160 seconds.
   Click OK.

6. Select Options to modify the DLC timers:

    - Response Timer (T!): set to 10
      This setting opens the response to queries to give more slack time to
      respond.

    - Acknowledge Timer (T2): set to 10
      This setting gives more time to respond to print requests.

    - Inactivity Timer (Ti): set to 10
      This setting will give the printer extra time to respond before DLC
      believes the connection is having a problem.

NOTE: Making these changes will affect all DLC ports.
