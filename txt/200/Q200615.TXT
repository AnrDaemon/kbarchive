TITLE   :SMS: Setup Does Not Install SQL Server 7.0 Unattended
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbsms200 smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

During Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Setup, you receive the
option to install Microsoft SQL Server. Installation of SQL Server version 6.5
is accomplished without user interaction. However, if you install SQL Server
7.0, you must complete SQL Server Setup by entering data when prompted, and you
must have sufficient SQL Server licenses for the installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During SMS 2.0 installation, Setup prompts you to provide SQL Server
configuration information if a current installation of SQL Server is not
detected on your computer. When Setup reaches the point where a SQL Server
source is needed, you are prompted to insert the CD-ROM or specify a network
source.

You must have sufficient licenses to install SQL Server for use with SMS. If SMS
was purchased as a part of Microsoft BackOffice, the server licenses were
purchased along with the product and the installation of SQL Server and SMS is
made easier.

If you purchased SMS separately from SQL Server (not in the Microsoft BackOffice
suite), you must install the SQL Server service pack that is on the SMS 2.0
CD-ROM. Setup prompts you when you need to perform this step.

SMS installation is SQL Server version independent. All you need to provide is a
licensed copy of SQL Server 6.5 or 7.0.
