TITLE   :XADM: Unrecognizable Chars. Receiving Mail from Japanese IMC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message (using TNEF or UUENCODE) with attachments from a
Japanese Internet Mail Service (Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5) or Internet Mail
Connector (Exchange Server 4.0) to an SMTP user, the Kanji characters in the
tags appeared as extended, unrecognizable characters.

CAUSE
=====

This happens when the tags are translated from Kanji to extended characters. If
the recipient does not support the character set being translated to, unreadable
characters are the result.

WORKAROUND
==========

Install the appropriate language page.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by product design. It is noted here that this behavior is not
specific to Exchange Server; language support for applications issues all
typically exhibit the same symptoms and require the same workaround.
