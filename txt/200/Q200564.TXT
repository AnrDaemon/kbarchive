PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you migrate users from a Lotus cc:Mail post office using the Migration
wizard, the migration process may fail. The following event IDs may be logged in
the event viewer:

   Event ID: 238
   Source: MSExchangeMigDS
   Type: Error
   Category: None
   Description: The e-mail address specified for import object <cc:Mail
   address> is not unique. <cc:Mail addres> has already been assigned
   to the address book entry <X400 address>.

   Event ID: 8149
   Source: MSExchangeMig
   Type: Error
   Category: None
   Description: Directory Section <Location of migration temporary
   files>\Directory.pri Line:5 Unknown DAPI error occurred importing this
   line. (See error logged by 'MSEXCHANGEMigDS')

   Event ID: 8002
   Source: MSExchangeMig
   Type: Error
   Category: None
   Description: Errors occurred during the Migration process. A recovery file has
   been created called <drive>\<path>\xxxxxxxx.PRI.

CAUSE
=====

The cc:Mail user account custom recipient object exists in the Exchange Server
directory. This error normally occurs if the cc:Mail post office has been
participating in directory synchronization with Exchange Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ensure that the cc:Mail user account that is being migrated is not in the
Exchange Server directory. Also verify that the custom recipient account is not
hidden.
