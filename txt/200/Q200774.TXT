TITLE   :XADM: Gear Icon Next to Mailboxes on a Distribution List
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use .csv files to import and export distribution lists, entries in the
distribution list may appear with a gear icon next to them instead of a mailbox
or world icon.

When a gear icon appears next to an object in the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program, that indicates that there is no directory entry for that
object.

CAUSE
=====

A good example of this is a distribution list created or modified by means of a
.csv file. If the .csv file contains members in the distribution list that
cannot be resolved into valid mailboxes, these mailboxes are listed as members
of the distribution list but are not used. If the mailboxes are then created,
the distribution list does not resolve the entry to the mailbox.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, create the mailboxes, export the distribution list,
and then import it again.
