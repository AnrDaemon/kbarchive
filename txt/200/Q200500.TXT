TITLE   :XADM: Move Server Stops When It Detects Duplicate Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Move Server Wizard doesn't finish, and you receive the following error
message:

   There were unexpected duplicate collisions with objects encountered in the
   site the server attempted to join. Please resolve these duplicates and rerun
   the Move Server Wizard.

The application event log also registers an accompanying warning with the
following description:

   The object <object name> caused a collision with an object in the site
   the server attempted to join.

CAUSE
=====

When you run the Move Server Wizard, if a Recipient container that is being
moved has the same name as a mailbox in the site where the server is being moved
to, a "collision" occurs during the mapping phase when the directory name
duplicates are actually detected. The collision causes the Move Server operation
to end.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove either the mailbox or container that has the same name as the one being
moved.

A point to remember: If you are removing a container, all objects in that
container are removed also. In that case, it may be easier to remove one mailbox
and then recreate it later rather than removing the container with the same name
and have all objects in that container be removed also.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.5.
