TITLE   :SMS: SMS 2.0 NDS Support Requires Recent IntranetWare Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server 2.0 now has native support for Novell NetWare
Directory Services (NDS) servers and clients. For the Systems Management Server
2.0 NDS components to work correctly, the most recent version of the Novell
IntranetWare network redirector must be installed on the site server.

Without the IntranetWare Client installed on your site server, SMS_EXECUTIVE
generates an error message indicating NDS Logon Manager stopped:

   Severity: Warning
   Component: SMS_NDS_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER
   Message ID: 2303
   Description: SMS NDS Logon Server Manager detected that there is no NetWare
   NDS redirector installed on the site server. SMS NDS Logon Server Manager
   cannot configure NetWare NDS containers and volumes for the NetWare NDS Logon
   Discovery and Client Installation methods until an appropriate redirector is
   installed on the site server.

   Solution: Install an appropriate NetWare NDS redirector on the site server.
   Please refer to your SMS documentation or the Microsoft Knowledge Base for
   further information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft recommends the use of Novell IntranetWare Client version 4.5 or later
for Windows NT when configuring Bindery Emulation site systems or when
configuring NDS site systems from a Systems Management Server 2.0 site server.
