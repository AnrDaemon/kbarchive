TITLE   :SMS: Smsiddup.exe Fails with Case-Sensitive SQL Server Code Page
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbsmsUtil smsdatabase smsutil

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Smsiddup.exe is a utility provided with Systems Management Server 1.2 Service
Pack 4 that generates a report, Smsiddup.log, containing computers that have
duplicate SMSIDs. This utility will fail on a database where Microsoft SQL
Server is configured with a case-sensitive code page. Note that the default code
page for SQL Server is not case-sensitive.

When this problem occurs, you receive the following messages:

   Searching Database for Machines with Duplicate SMS IDs

   SQL Server message 207, state 2, severity 16:
   Invalid column name 'SMSid0'.

   SQL Server message 145, state 1, severity 15:
   Order-by items must appear in the select-list if SELECT DISTINCT is
   specified.

   DB-LIBRARY error:
   General SQL Server error: Check messages from the SQL Server.

   SQL Server message 208, state 1, severity 16:
   Invalid object name '#clonefind4'.

   DB-LIBRARY error:
   General SQL Server error: Check messages from the SQL Server.

   No Machines with Duplicate SMS IDs Found

   SQL Server message 3701, state 1, severity 11:
   Cannot drop the table '#clonefind4', because it doesn't exist in the system
   catalogs.

   DB-LIBRARY error:
   General SQL Server error: Check messages from the SQL Server.

CAUSE
=====

The column names being passed to SQL Server are not the correct case for a
case-sensitive server.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
