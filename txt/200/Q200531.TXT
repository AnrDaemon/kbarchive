TITLE   :RasDial() Does Not Connect Dual Channels with Some ISDN Adapters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the RasDial function to initiate a Remote Access Services (RAS)
connection over an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) adapter, a
connection to only one channel may be created (instead of a connection to two or
more channels).

CAUSE
=====

Even if the phonebook entry is configured for multiple channels and works
correctly when you invoke it manually, RasDial establishes only a single-channel
connection with some ISDN adapters.


RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Rasphone.exe command-line tool to call the Dial-Up Networking phonebook.
