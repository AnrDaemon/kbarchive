SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how, when using a check box in a column on a grid, you can
move to the next column immediately on clicking the check box. The default
behavior is to remain in the current column.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By placing code in the Valid event procedure of the check box object, you can
programmatically determine the current column and then move to the next column
using the SetFocus method. The following code illustrates one way to do this.

   FOR myctlcntr=1 TO this.parent.parent.columncount && cycle through columns
      IF THIS.PARENT.PARENT.COLUMNS(myctlcntr).CONTROLS(2).NAME = THIS.NAME

         * In the next line columns(myctlcntr+1) comes beforem controls(2)
         * because the column header is the first control and data is the
         * second control.

         THIS.PARENT.PARENT.COLUMNS(myctlcntr+1).CONTROLS(2).SETFOCUS
         EXIT

      ENDIF
   ENDFOR
