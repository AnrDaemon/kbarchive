TITLE   :PRB: Stock Font and Color Property Pages Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:2.00 2.10 2.20 4.00 4.10 4.20 |
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you include one of the stock CDK property pages (Font, Color, or Picture)
in your application, it may not appear when the property sheet dialog box is
displayed. The default and other custom property pages may still be visible.

CAUSE
=====

One possible cause of this problem is the lack of registration of the DLL which
includes the stock property page implementations.

Depending on the version of Visual C++, this DLL is:

   VC 2.X ==> OC30.DLL
   VC 4.0, VC 4.1 ==> MFC40.DLL
   VC 4.2 ==> MFC42.DLL

RESOLUTION
==========

Register the appropriate DLL using regsrv32.exe that comes with the CDK and is
located in the CDK \Bin directory. Use this line:

      REGSVR32 OC30.DLL

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has seen several cases where Oc30.dll was either not registered at all
or only partially registered. We have not been able to isolate the cause of this
failure.

Before attempting to register OC30.DLL, confirm that it is in the System32
directory in Windows NT and the System directory in Windows 95.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

To demonstrate the problem, first confirm that the CIRC3 sample has been compiled
and registered. Confirm that the Font and Color property pages are seen when the
control is run by looking at the property sheet from the menu selection Edit
Properties. Then follow these steps:

1. Delete the Font class ID from the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID. The CLSID for the
   Font property page is:

   {2542F180-3532-1069-A2CD-00AA0034B50B}.

2. Run a container (On the Tools menu, click Test Container in Visual C++), and
   insert the CIRC3 Ole control.

3. On the Edit menu, click Properties, and note that the Font property page is
   no longer visible.

You could also delete the Color property page ID:

   {DDF5A00-B9C0-101A-AF1A-00AA0034B50B}

Or the Picture proper page ID:

   {FC7AF71D-FC74-101A-84ED-08002B2EC713}

NOTE: The class IDs for these property pages are different under Visual C++
version 4.x
