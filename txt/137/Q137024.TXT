TITLE   :PRB: Asterisks Don't Hide an RDC Password Set in Design Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set the Password property of the RemoteData control (RDC) at design
time, it is possible for others to read the password on your screen as it is
entered because the password is not filtered by asterisks. When the ODBC dialog
box does hide the password by converting it into asterisks.

CAUSE
=====

The RDC does not control the edit field in the Property window and therefore
cannot force asterisks to be displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Passwords that need to be protected as sensitive information should not be coded
into the Properties window of the RemoteData control.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place a RemoteData control on Form1, and set the Connect property of the
   RemoteData control to ODBC.

3. Type a value into the Password property of the RemoteData control. Note that
   the password is readable.

4. Run the program. After you select a DataSource, the ODBC driver manager
   displays the login dialog, and the password is displayed as asterisks.
