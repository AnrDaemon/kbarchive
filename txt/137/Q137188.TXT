TITLE   :Streets 4.0: Copy Area Map to Disk Loses Current Zoom and View
PRODUCT :Microsoft Automap
PROD/VER:4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Automap Streets for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Automap Streets version 4.0, after you copy an area map to the hard disk, the
Zoom and View settings of the area map are restored to default settings.

This behavior occurs instead of the expected behavior; you expect that the
current Zoom and View settings would be maintained after you copy an area map to
the hard disk.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you must manually restore the previous Zoom and
View settings.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Automap Streets version 4.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
