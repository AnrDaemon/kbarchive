KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an ATI Graphics Ultra Pro (Mach32) video adapter in a Microchannel
(MCA) computer, the Windows 95 icons, menu arrows, and minimize and maximize
buttons may not appear in Windows 95.

You may also experience screen redraw problems when you use an 800 x 600 x 256
color resolution with this video adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the System.ini file in the
   Windows folder. Add the following line to the [Display] section of the file:

      MemMapRegs=0

   After you add this line, save and then close the System.ini file.

2. Change the hardware jumper on the video adapter to enable VGA mode, and then
   disable the on-board VGA controller on the motherboard. For information about
   configuring the video adapter and motherboard, please refer to each product's
   documentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Adding the "MemMapRegs=0" line to the System.ini file disables the use of
memory-mapped I/O for the adapter, which may be necessary for MCA computers.
