-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To implement client-side RPC, Windows 95 uses a Name Service Provider on
a Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server. This service is provided
by the Windows NT Locator which is a database that contains a list of
servers and the information to connect to them. To allow Windows 95 to
point to the computer running the locator service, modify the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. On the computer running Windows 95, run Registry Editor and add the
   NameService key under:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc

2. The NameService key should contain the following string values:

      DefaultSyntax        "3"
      Endpoint             "\pipe\locator
      NetworkAddress       "\\<Machine running Locator service>
      Protocol             "ncacn_np"
      ServerNetworkAddress "\\<Machine running Locator service>

3. For other protocol entries, view the registry under:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\ClientProtocols

      Default              (value not set)
      ncacn_ip_tcp         "rpcltc3.dll"
      ncacn_nb_nb          "rpcltc5.dll"
      ncacn_np             "rpcltc1.dll"
      ncacn_spx            "rpcltc6.dll"
      ncalrpc              "ncalrpc"
