TITLE   :FIX: Can't Change the Title of the Validation Error Box
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The title on the Validation Error text box cannot be changed.

CAUSE
=====

The dialog box title is being pulled from an internal resource of Visual FoxPro,
so it cannot be changed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Trap for the rule failure within the rule's code, and present a customized error
message. Let the rule return True (.T.) as in code in the "Workaround Example"
section in this article.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro 3.0b
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Execute the following commands in the Command window:

      CREATE DATABASE Test1

      CREATE TABLE tbl1 (one c(3) CHECK !EMPTY(one) ;
         ERROR 'error message here')

2. Browse the new table, and press CTRL+Y to append a blank record.

3. The validation box will appear with "Microsoft Visual FoxPro" as the title.

Workaround Example
------------------

Change the rule from an expression to a program or procedure that is in the
Stored Procedures:

      ALTER TABLE tbl1 ALTER COLUMN one SET CHECK myrule() NOVALIDATE

   The procedure myrule may look as follows:

      PROCEDURE myrule
      IF EMPTY(one)
         =MESSAGEBOX('The -one- FIELD CAN NOT BE EMPTY',0,'MY APPLICATION')
      ENDIF

After the table is browsed and CTRL+Y is pressed, the customized dialog box will
appear with the new title.

NOTE: A blank record will still be appended to the table. This issue of the rule
violation is best handled within the application's design.
