TITLE   :Microsoft Backup Seems to Display Incorrect Information

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Restore tab in Backup, click a drive or folder containing a
backup set file, and then double-click the backup set file, the contents of the
backup set file seem to be displayed inaccurately. In particular, the size
displayed initially is 0, and the modified date displayed is not the date that
the backup was made.

CAUSE
=====

When you double-click a backup set file on the Restore tab, or click a backup
set file and then click Next Step, the contents of that backup set file are
displayed. The folder that is displayed initially in the pane on the right side
of the screen is the root folder of the drive from which the backup was made.
The information displayed to the right of this folder is information about the
folder itself, not about the backup. A size of 0 bytes is reported because
Windows 95 always reports folders as 0 bytes in size.

RESOLUTION
==========

To see information about the actual files contained in the backup, double- click
the folders displayed in the pane on the right side of the screen until the
files in the folders are displayed.
