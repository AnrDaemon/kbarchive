TITLE   :PRB: Program w/ @..SAY..GETs Exits If Press PAGE UP/PAGE DOWN
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some developers porting code form other FoxPro versions, including MS-DOS and
Windows, are still using hard coded screen displays (@..SAY..GETs in a .prg
file).

In Visual FoxPro, you will find that the behavior is somewhat different from
version 2.x products and other XBase languages. Pressing the PAGE UP or PAGE
DOWN key while the program is running causes the program to stop, and no
validation takes place if the GET command has a Valid clause.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the beginning of the program place this code:

      ON KEY LABEL PGUP KEYBOARD "{BACKTAB}"
      ON KEY LABEL PGDN KEYBOARD "{TAB}"

This will allow the program to continue normally as if the ENTER key was pressed.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program containing this code:

      CLEAR
      mvar  = SPACE(10)
      mvar2 = SPACE(10)
      @ 1,1 GET mvar VALID myvalid()
      @ 4,1 GET mvar2
      READ CYCLE

      PROCEDURE myvalid
        WAIT WINDOW 'In the Procedure of Myvalid'
      RETURN

2. Run the program.

3. Put a value in mvar and press ENTER. The message 'In the Procedure of
   Myvalid' appears as expected.

4. Enter a value in mvar2 and press ENTER. The program cycles back to mvar.

5. Press the PAGE DOWN Key. The program exits, and no validation takes place.
