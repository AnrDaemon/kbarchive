SUMMARY
=======

As of August, 1995, Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5
with Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 3.5 installed achieved the C2 security rating
from the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). Windows NT Workstation and Windows
NT Server are now the first mainstream, GUI operating systems to successfully
complete this security evaluation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As of September, 1995, customers who require C2 secure versions of Windows NT
Workstation or Server version 3.5 can begin placing orders directly with
Microsoft Inside Sales at (800) 426-9400.

Successful completion of the C2 security evaluation means that Windows NT
Workstation and Server version 3.5 have now been added to the Evaluated Products
List (EPL) published by the National Security Agency. Even though the C2
security class springs from the needs of US government installations, any
organization concerned about security of business- sensitive data may have need
of these security features.

For additional information on the C2 Evaluation and Certification process, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
