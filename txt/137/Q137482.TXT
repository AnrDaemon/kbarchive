TITLE   :LUA Program Receives Host Sign-On Screen Twice and then Hangs
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your LUA program, the SSCP Welcome message screen appears twice,
and the LUA program seems to hang.

CAUSE
=====

Under certain timing conditions, when an LUA session is closed (with an
SLI_CLOSE statement) and immediately reopened (with an SLI_OPEN statement) over
a fast link, SNA Server may incorrectly resend the host SSCP welcome message a
second time to the LUA program. As a result the LUA program may hang.

The following message flow causes this problem:

   LUA Program    SNA Server      Host
   -----------------------------------------------------
                                 <- UNBIND
                 UNBIND +RSP ->
                 NOTIFY(SLU disabled) ->
  SLI_CLOSE ->
  SLI_OPEN ->
                                 <- SSCP welcome message
                 <- SLI_OPEN(SSCP welcome message)
                                 <- NOTIFY +RSP
                 NOTIFY(SLU enabled) ->
                                 <- SSCP welcome message
  SLI_RECEIVE ->
                 <- SLI_RECEIVE (SSCP welcome message)
                                 <- NOTIFY +RSP

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to SNA Server version 2.11 and install the
updated file SNASERVR.EXE.

To work around this problem, you can put a small delay in the application between
the SLI_CLOSE completing and issuing the new SLI_OPEN command.

STATUS
