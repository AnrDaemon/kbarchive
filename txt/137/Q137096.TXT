TITLE   :PRB: Type Mismatch When Passing Variants to Word Using OLE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbVBp400

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to pass a Variant data type to Microsoft Word using OLE automation,
a "Type mismatch" error occurs. For example, if objVar is an object variable set
to a Word.Basic object, and Text1 is some text box containing a string value,
the following line of code generates the error:

      objVar.Insert  Text1

This problem did not exist in Visual Basic version 3.0, so it must be taken into
consideration when doing any code porting and/or upgrading.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, the variable passed to Word must be explicitly typed. The
previous example can be replaced by either of the following to prevent this
error:

      objVar.Insert Text1.Text

   -or-

      objVar.Insert CStr(Text1)

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design

Steps to Reproduce and Correct Behavior
---------------------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a command button (Command1) and a text box (Text1) to Form1.

3. Place the following code in the Command1_Click event procedure:

         Dim objVar As Object
         Set objVar = CreateObject("Word.Basic")
         objVar.FileNew
         objVar.Insert Text1
         Set objVar = Nothing

4. Press F5 to run the program.

5. Click Command1. Error 13, "Type mismatch" is generated.

6. Modify the code in the Command1_Click event procedure to this:

         Dim objVar As Object
         Set objVar = CreateObject("Word.Basic")
         objVar.FileNew
         ' Notice that this is the only line changed
         objVar.Insert Text1.Text
         Set objVar = Nothing

7. Repeat step 5. No error is encountered. Check Microsoft Word, and you will
   find a new document containing the word "Text1" (the value of Text1.Text).
