SYMPTOMS

In the Bookshelf Notes feature, the Alt+N key combinations should move the focus
to the annotations box so annotations can be added. However, if there are no
Notes, the key combination closes the Notes dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Bookshelf. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Bookshelf includes a Note feature that allows you to create a list of special
interest articles. This feature also lets you make your own annotations about
the articles.
