SYMPTOMS
========

If a Novell NetWare file server's name is longer than 25 characters, the name
cannot be entered in the Preferred Server box in the properties for the
Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks.

CAUSE
=====

Novell allows server names to be from 2 to 47 characters long. However, the
Preferred Server box in the properties for the Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks is designed to allow a maximum of 25 characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this limitation, enter the file server name in the Enter Network
Password dialog box when you log on to a NetWare server. This field allows up to
47 characters, and the designated server becomes the default NetWare server.

This server name is displayed in the properties for the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks, but is truncated at 25 characters.
