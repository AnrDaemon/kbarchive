TITLE   :PC DirSync: Incorrect SMTP Addresses in POL After Dir-Sync
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to access details or send mail to SMTP users from the Postoffice
Address List (POL), the following error may occur:

   Address no longer valid address or PO no longer exists

However, you can access the details from the Global Address List (GAL) or the
SMTP works correctly.

CAUSE
=====

When SMTP addresses are included in the POL, and you transfer the SMTP addresses
through Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync), the SMTP addresses in the POL may
have incorrect tuple identifier (TID) values. However, the SMTP list and the GAL
do have the correct TID values.

RESOLUTION
==========

Using Dir-Sync to import SMTP addresses is not a recommended method of
exchanging SMTP addresses with other postoffices. Instead, use the Mail Import
command (IMPORT.EXE) with the -a and -g options. This allows SMTP addresses to
be added to the SMTP list, POL, and GAL without the above problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Microsoft Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE), you can enable the
option to synchronize SMTP addresses. This option is in Config, Dirsync,
Requestor, Types. If SMTP is set to Yes, then Dir-Sync will distribute all SMTP
addresses when a requestor does an Import command; this import will send a
complete SMTP list from the Dir-Sync server to the requestor.

When the requestor processes these updates during the T3 cycle of Dir-Sync
(reqmain -r), the SMTP addresses will be added to the SMTP list, and the SMTP
list is rebuilt with new TID values. Then the GAL is rebuilt from the SMTP list
with the correct TID values.

Because Dir-Sync rebuilds the SMTP list with new TID values and the POL is never
touched, the POL will still have old TID values for any existing SMTP addresses.
As a result, when you choose an SMTP address from the POL the above error will
occur.

For more information about Rebuild and Import, please refer to pages 319- 321 of
the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks "Administrator's Guide."
