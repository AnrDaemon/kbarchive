SUMMARY
=======

The use of constants is an efficient way to keep code clear, easier to document,
and more understandable. When you create ActiveX components, it is more
efficient to provide constants with the server in a ready-to-use form. This
eliminates the need to declare constants in client (container) applications and
makes it easier to call into server classes. This article describes two ways to
implement constants with your ActiveX component.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Two ways to provide constants for use with an ActiveX component:

1. Use the Property Get function to expose the constants as read-only
   properties. For example, if MY_CONSTANT is a constant set to the value 4, the
   following shows how to expose it to client applications:

         Public Property Get MY_CONSTANT () As Integer
            MY_CONSTANT = 4
         End Property

2. Create a Type Library using Object Description Language (ODL). MkTypLib is
   the tool used to process ODL source files; it produces a type library (.tlb
   file) and an optional C- or C++-style header file. The following is an
   example ODL script that you could use to provide an OLE server with the
   constant MY_CONSTANT:

         [
            uuid(12345678-AAAA-BBBB-CCCC-000000000000),
            lcid (0x0000409),
            ,helpfile("myhelp.hlp")
            ,helpstring("More info for my server")
            ,version(1.0)
         ]

         library MyServer
         {
            [uuid(12345678-AAAA-BBBB-CCCC-111111111111),  \\unique guid
            helpstring("My Constants"),
            helpcontext(1011389), dllname(mydll)]
            module Constants {
            [helpstring("This is the value for MY_CONSTANT"),
               helpcontext(1012527)]

               const short MY_CONSTANT = 4; } \\module
         }\\ library

MkTypLib comes with Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows NT and
Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.0 or later

For more information on Type Libraries and ODL, please see the Win32 SDK.
