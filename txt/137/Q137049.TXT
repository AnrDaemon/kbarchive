 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Save As on the File menu in Backup, the name displayed in the
File Name field is "Full System Backup.Set," which is the name of the default
file set installed with Backup. If you click OK to save your current file set
with this name, you overwrite the default file set, and you cannot perform a
backup of your entire system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To recover the original "Full System Backup.Set" file, you must reinstall
Backup. To do so, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

2. On the Windows Setup tab, click Disk Tools, and then click Details.

3. Click the Backup check box to clear it, and then click OK.

4. Click OK.

5. Repeat steps 1-2.

6. Click the Backup check box to select it, and then click OK.

7. Click OK.

NOTE: This procedure overwrites the current "Full System Backup.Set" file in the
Program Files\Accessories folder. If this file represents a custom backup set
that you want to keep, rename the file to another name before you follow the
steps above. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
   System Tools, and then click Backup.

2. On the File menu, click Open File Set.

3. Click the "Full System Backup.Set" file, and then click Open. Note that this
   file is installed by default in the Program Files\Accessories folder.

4. On the File menu, click Save As.

5. Type a new name in the File Name field, and then click OK.

6. Quit Backup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Full System Backup.Set" file set is designed to back up your entire system.
This file set is configured to include all the registry files that are necessary
for your system to work properly when you restore the files. You should not use
this file set for incremental or partial backups.
