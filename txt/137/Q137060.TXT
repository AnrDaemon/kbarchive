Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a form, and change the FontSize property to 1.

2. Run the form, and verify that the form runs correctly.

3. Modify the form, and set the FontSize property to the default (10).

4. Place an EditBox and a Spinner object on the Form.

5. In the EditBox Click event procedure, enter this line of code:

      This.FontSize = ThisForm.Spinner1.Value

6. Run the form, and enter a value greater 1 in the Spinner control and type
   some information into the EditBox control. Verify that the FontSize is in
   accordance with the Spinner control value.

7. Change the Spinner control value to "1" and click the EditBox control. A
   fault (either a Page Fault or a Divide By Zero fault) will occur and Visual
   FoxPro will exit.
