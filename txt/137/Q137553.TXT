TITLE   :IBM 4019 Defaults to Manual Paper Feed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the IBM 4019 driver is installed on Windows NT it defaults to Manual Paper
feed. This causes the user to have to manually feed paper for each print job
rather than having the paper feed from the paper tray.

CAUSE
=====

The UNIDRIVER installs the default form Letter on the first paper source and
manual feed is the first paper source on the 4019 driver.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can workaround the problem by associating Manual Feed with no form and Upper
Tray with the Letter form using the following steps:

1. Run Print Manager.

2. From the Printer menu, choose Properties.

3. Choose Setup.

4. In the Source box, choose Manual Feed.

5. In the Form box, choose (None).

6. In the Source box, choose Upper Tray.

7. In the Form box, choose Letter.

8. Choose OK.

You can also work around this problem by setting the IBM 4019 to HP emulation
mode by turning the printer off, and then turn the printer back on while holding
down the Font button. Then, in Print Manager, install and use the HP LaserJet
series II driver.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should be
applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the service pack release containing this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information.
