KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Automap Road Atlas for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.02 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Automap Road Atlas miscalculates the fuel consumption for a journey.

For example, if the fuel cost for all road types is set to $1.00 per gallon and
miles per gallon (MPG) is set to 1, the cost calculation should yield $1.00 per
mile. In this case, Road Atlas consistently over- estimates the cost by
approximately 0.5 percent.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Automap versions 3.0 and 3.02.
This problem was corrected in Automap version 3.03.

Additional query words: auto auto-map automap reference wrong overcharge inaccurate
