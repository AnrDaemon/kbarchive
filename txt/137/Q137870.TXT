generated in protected mode. The real-mode NMI handler does receive the NMI if
it is generated in real mode.

CAUSE

This problem occurs when Emm386.exe is loaded in protected mode, because the
virtual machine (VM) flag does not get set during the process of creating the
stack frame to go from protected mode to real mode.
