IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.

registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to disable NetBIOS name resolution on a domain- name
system (DNS) while retaining other DNS functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Windows 95 tries to resolve a NetBIOS name using a NetBIOS name server, it
first checks a Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server, and then checks a
DNS server.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

To disable NetBIOS name resolution on a DNS server, change the string value

   EnableDNS

in the registry key

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP

from 1 to 0.
