 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Mail for AppleTalk Network servers within different site names have the ability
to send their address lists in a single direction, if desired.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can change the site name by running the Mail Network Administrator utility
and selecting the Set Site Name option under the Admin menu. Then you can use
the configure routing option to choose a site and server within the site listed
in the drop down box under the Bridged to Server option. You can then either
export the local user list to or import the user list from the targeted server.

The administrator on the target server must perform the same operation in order
for one way local user list exchange to work properly. For example, if you (the
administrator of the source server) want to export only to the target server,
you would choose Export User Lists, and the target server administrator would
select Import User Lists.

You can purge unwanted user lists from the server by running the Remove User
Lists option under the Admin menu.
