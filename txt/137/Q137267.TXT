The information in this article applies to:

    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT

SYMPTOMS
========

When an SLI_Open API call is issued, and the SLI application has defined format
1 Initself, the WinSLI library returns the following error message in an RUI
trace:

   initself not valid

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server 2.0, 2.1 and 2.11 SLI interface was originally written to support
only Format 0 Initself messages. However, it has been expanded in SNA Server
2.11 to support Format 1 as well.

Page 5-22 of the IBM SNA Formats Guide defines a format 1 Initself to be
identified as 810681 (bytes 0-2), while the format 0 Initself to be identified
as 010681.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the files, WINSLI.DLL, for 16-bit clients, and
WINSLI32.DLL for 32-bit clients, to correct this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
