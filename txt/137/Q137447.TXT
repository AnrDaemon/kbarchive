SUMMARY
=======

This article provides information about what the Form Wizard produces when the
default options are selected. This will help you learn what to expect when steps
are skipped if you select the Finish button.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two kinds of Form Wizards: the Form Wizard (Normal) and the
One-to-Many Form Wizard. The following describes the defaults for each step in
the Form Wizard and the One-to-Many Form Wizard.

Form Wizard Defaults
--------------------

Step 1: Field Selection

The default is based on the data of the current work area. If a free table is
open, the fields of the table are available. If a free table is not open but a
database is open, the first fields of the first table in the database are
available for selection. After selecting one or more fields, the Finish button
is enabled and will bypass all remaining steps using the default values.

Step 2: Style

The default is Standard form style with Text Buttons button type.

Step 3: Sort Order

The default is Natural record order.

Step 4: Finish

The default is Save Form for Later Use.

One-to-Many Form Wizard Defaults
--------------------------------

These defaults are all the same as those listed for the Form Wizard except that
the Field Selection step (step 1) is replaced by these three steps:

Step 1: Select Fields from Parent Table

This step is similar to Step 1 of the Form Wizard.

Step 2 : Select Fields from Child Table

This defaults to a free table of the current work area or an open database if no
table is open. If no fields are selected in this step, the One-to- Many Form
Wizard is essentially the same as the standard Forms Wizard.

Step 3: Relationship

If fields are selected in Step 2, the default relationship is the one specified
as a persistent relation in a database, or the active relation if the tables are
free.
