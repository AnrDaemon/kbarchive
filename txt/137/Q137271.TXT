TITLE   :Group Policies Are Not Recognized with NETX or VLM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork 3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Group Policies may not be recognized.

CAUSE
=====

Group Policy resolution does not function with Novell's real-mode NETX and VLM
redirectors.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use the protected-mode Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks, or the Novell NetWare Client 32 update for Windows 95 (C3295d.exe)
available from Novell.

NOTE: The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks cannot access Novell NetWare 4.x
servers using NetWare Directory Services (NDS) without bindery emulation enabled
on the servers. In addition, programs designed to use the Novell DOS Requester
(Vlm.exe) or Netx.exe exclusively may not function properly.

To install the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.

2. Click Add, click Client, and then click Add.

3. Click Microsoft, click Client For NetWare Networks, and then click OK until
   you return to Control Panel.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. Policies do not work with a real-mode client. To use
policies, you must be using the protected-mode Microsoft client for NetWare
Networks.
