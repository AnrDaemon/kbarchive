TITLE   :Public Folders with Unread Messages Not Bold
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Public folder names are not displayed in bold letters when there are unread
messages in the public folders. This is contrary to the behavior of private
folders that are displayed in bold letters when there are unread messages in
them.

WORKAROUND
==========

To be notified that a public folder contains unread messages, create a shortcut
to that particular public folder. When the public folder contains unread
messages, the shortcut to the public folder will then be displayed in bold
letters.

To update the public folders instead of just the shortcuts would be prohibitively
uneconomical in terms of CPU and network bandwidth, as there could be thousands
of public folders and this would have to be done for each user.
