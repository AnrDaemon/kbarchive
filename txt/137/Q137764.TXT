CAUTION: Do not use the installation steps if you are using Microsoft Windows 95
or Microsoft Windows NT. The manual installation uses a batch file that copies
Windows 3.x system files onto your hard drive. Allowing the system files to be
overwritten in Windows 95 or Windows NT may cause improper system performance.

letter of your CD-ROM drive.

If you type "pss" (without the quotation marks) at and MS_DOS command prompt from

   You need to tell this batch file where to install Microsoft Automap
   Streets and where your Windows directory is.

   The command line is as follows:

   PSS (destination path) (windows path) (cd path)

   Where:

   (destination path)  Is the path to where you want to install
                       Microsoft Automap Streets.

   (windows path)      Is your Windows path.  This must be correct!
                       There is no check to make sure it exists.

   (cd path)           Is the drive letter of your CD-ROM followed by
                       a :.  e.g. type: pss c:\automap c:\windows d:

Notice how the command line entry does not contain a \ after the d:
