SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to cause a dialog box to appear and prompt you for
optional parameters when you run an MS-DOS-based program in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To cause a dialog box to prompt you for optional parameters when you run an
MS-DOS-based program, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click the program's shortcut, and then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

2. On the Program tab, add a space and a question mark to the end of the command
   in the Cmd Line box.

   For example, to cause a dialog box to prompt you for optional parameters when
   you run an MS-DOS prompt, you would modify the Cmd Line box entry to read:

   c:\windows\command.com ?

3. Click OK.
