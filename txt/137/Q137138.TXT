The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 clients with ODI drivers and updated files from the
Windows NT Server 3.51 CD-ROM stop responding (hang) in a IPX WAN environment
when heavy database transactions are in progress.

CAUSE
=====

In a WAN environment using IPX only and forwarding type 20 broadcasts, the
Windows for Workgroups computer hangs and must be rebooted. This occurs under
the following conditions:

 - The Windows for Workgroups computer is using the NetWare ODI stack.

 - All Windows for Workgroups computers are members of the workgroup named
   "WORKGROUP."

 - The Windows for Workgroups computer is performing many transactions with a
   Windows NT server.

 - The Windows for Workgroups computer is a potential master browser.

The Windows for Workgroups computer fails if it receives a browser announcement
or a browser election is forced while it is busy with database transactions.

WORKAROUND
==========

Have all Windows for Workgroups computers join the domain, or disable Windows
for Workgroups browsing by adding "MaintainServerList=NO" (without the quotation
marks) to the [network] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups 3.11. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
