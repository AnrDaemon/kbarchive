The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use different passwords for Microsoft Windows products and Windows NT,
attempting to change a password may result in not having the option to change
the password and you can receive an error message in Windows NT. When you
restart your computer, the password is changed, even though you received an
error message in Windows NT when you tried to change it. The error message you
may receive is:

   The password you typed for Microsoft Networking is not correct. Please type
   the old password.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when the Disable Password Caching policy has been set, or
if the Windows products and Windows NT passwords are different.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the same password for Windows products and Windows NT, or have your network
administrator enable password caching.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Password caching is enabled or disabled using the Policy Editor tool
(Poledit.exe) to change the following value:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Network\DisablePwdCaching

NOTE: This registry entry does not exist by default.
