======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Corel Draw version 6.0 in Windows 95, your computer may
pause for several seconds at a time, or you may receive one of the following
error messages:

   - Setup Has Encountered a Problem
   Setup file = Common\List1.c
   line = 1013
   Report to Microsoft Product Services

   - Setup Has Encountered a Problem
   Setup file = Common\List1.c
   MS Setup Tools error


CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur for the following reasons:

 - You are using real-mode CD-ROM drivers. Examples of real-mode CD-ROM drivers
   are Mscdex.exe and Corelcdx.exe.

 - You are installing Corel Draw over a network and you have not mapped a drive
   letter to the network share containing the source files. Corel Draw Setup
   cannot correctly interpret universal naming convention (UNC) paths.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve these error messages, use protected-mode CD-ROM drivers rather than
real-mode versions.

If you are installing Corel Draw over a network, make sure to map the network
drive from which you are installing Corel Draw.

MORE INFORMATION
================
