SYMPTOMS
========

When you use HyperTerminal to connect to a bulletin board system (BBS), the
BACKSPACE and DELETE keys may remove only half of some characters.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the BACKSPACE and DELETE keys are handled as SBCS
(Single-Byte Characters Set) characters and the BBS is using DBCS (Double-Byte
Character Set) characters.

The BACKSPACE key may delete only half of a DBCS character if the BACK- SPACE key
is interpreted as a single-space character.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Whether or not this behavior occurs depends on how the BBS handles SBCS
BACKSPACE and DELETE keys.

Some BBSs handle BACKSPACE and DELETE keys in a manner that works properly in
HyperTerminal.
