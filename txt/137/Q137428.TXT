TITLE   :Not Enough Memory on 4-MB System When Setup Is Started Again
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Setup again from the MS-DOS prompt after your computer lost power
(or you turned it off) while you were upgrading Windows version 3.x to Windows
95, you may receive the following error message:

   Not enough XMS memory to run Setup. Please free up <xxx> amount of XMS
   and re-run Setup.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur on computers with 4 MB of RAM if the computer loses power
or is shut off while you are upgrading Windows 3.x to Windows 95. Depending on
where in the installation process power is lost, Setup may have copied enough
files to the Windows folder that the original version of Windows does not
function correctly. When you run Setup from an MS-DOS prompt, a 4-MB computer
may not have enough extended memory for Setup to run.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable all unnecessary programs and TSRs in the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat
files. If you are running Setup from floppy disks or a flat directory, and no
special drivers are necessary to start the computer, you can bypass the startup
files and the loading of drivers by pressing the F5 key when you see the
"Starting MS-DOS" message.
