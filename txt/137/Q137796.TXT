OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui kbsmsAdmin smsadmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If you customize the toolbar in the Systems Management Server Administrator
window so that custom buttons use all spaces in the toolbar and you add another
button, the button does not appear on the screen.

This problem occurs whether the Systems Management Server Administrator window is
set to restored or maximized size.

CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server Administrator is not able to start a second row of
custom toolbar buttons and attempts to display the custom button outside the
Systems Management Server Administrator window.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
