 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0

SYMPTOMS
========

During a PowerPoint slide show, you can press ALT+TAB to switch to an editing
view of that slide show. If you change the interactive settings of an object in
that slide show, those changes won't go into effect until you restart the slide
show.

RESOLUTION
==========

To allow your changes to take effect, you must stop the slide show and restart
it. At that point your interactive settings will be correct.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PowerPoint version 7.0 for
Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
