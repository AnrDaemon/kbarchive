TITLE   :Password Change Fails Using DNS to Resolve Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When DNS is used to resolve names from Windows NT 3.5, the operation of changing
a password may fail.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs over TCP/IP because the client computer sending the request
to resolve the name of the domain receives a response for the IP address of the
PDC (Primary Domain Controller) from the DNS Server, but attempts to form a
session with the PDC with the name of the domain as the destination instead of
the name of the PDC. This results in a Negative Session Response from the
primary domain controller with status Caller Name Not Found.


Under Windows NT 3.51, the three way-handshake and session setup are preceded by
a NetBT request from the client computer for registered services on the PDC.
Upon receiving the response, the client correctly establishes a session to the
PDC with the PDCs machine name as the destination.




STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT 3.51.
