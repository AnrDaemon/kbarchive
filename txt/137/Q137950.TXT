======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Pages 78-79 of the Visual FoxPro 3.0 Developer's Guide, has an example of
creating a control array containing command buttons and check boxes. While this
example works, creating a control array containing text boxes does not work as
expected.

NOTE: This example is located on page 72 of the Visual FoxPro 5.0 Developer's
Guide. In Visual FoxPro 6.0, if you have the Online help installed, from the
Help menu, choose Search to open the MSDN library Visual Studio 6.0 window.
Clear the three check boxes in the lower left portion of the screen, and type
"Creating Arrays of Members" (without the quotation marks) in the Search For
text box. Click the first selection, to open "Chapter 3: Object Oriented
Programming". Scroll to the bottom of the chapter and look for the heading,
"Creating Arrays of Members".

WORKAROUND
==========

The following code demonstrates how to create a form with a control array that
has three text boxes:

      *_ there are 2 bugs here they are pointed out with comments
      PUBLIC oForm
      oForm = CREATEOBJECT("Form")
      oForm.AddObject("myarray","ctrlarr")
      oForm.myarray.Visible = 1
      oForm.Visible = 1

      DEFINE CLASS ctrlarr AS Container
      *- Make this a control array
      DIMENSION txtdim(3)
      ADD OBJECT txtdim(1) AS mytext WITH Top = 10
      ADD OBJECT txtdim(2) AS mytext WITH Top = 40
      ADD OBJECT txtdim(3) AS mytext WITH Top = 70

      PROCEDURE txtdim.VALID
         LPARAMETERS nIndex
         WAIT WINDOW PROGRAM() + ' ' + This.Parent.txtdim(nIndex).value
      **********************************************************************
      * Should be able to use this syntax this(nIndex).value not
      * this.parent.txtdim(nIndex).value***
      **********************************************************************
      ENDPROC
      ENDDEFINE

      DEFINE CLASS mytext AS TextBox
      **********************************************************************
      * If the following two lines are changed to comments, the valid in the
      * control array won't fire ***
      **********************************************************************

      PROCEDURE VALID
      ENDPROC
      ENDDEFINE

      *** end code

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Follow the example in the Developer's Guide. For example:

      PUBLIC oForm
      oForm = CREATEOBJECT("Form")
      oForm.AddObject("myarray","ctrlarr")
      oForm.myarray.visible = 1
      oForm.Visible = 1

      DEFINE CLASS ctrlarr AS Container
      *- Make this a control array
      DIMENSION txtdim(3)
      ADD OBJECT txtdim(1) AS textbox WITH Top = 10
      ADD OBJECT txtdim(2) AS textbox WITH Top = 40
      ADD OBJECT txtdim(3) AS textbox WITH Top = 70

      PROCEDURE txtdim.Valid
      LPARAMETERS nIndex
         WAIT WINDOW This(nIndex).Value + ' ' + STR(nindex)
      ENDDEFINE

The code should work. However, when you run it, no errors occur, but the Valid
event does not fire.
