PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Windows 95 on a computer with an Asus motherboard with an Intel
Triton chip set, and the mouse is connected to the PS/2 mouse port on the
computer, the mouse may stop responding and the keyboard may not work in MS-DOS
sessions.

Reconfiguring the mouse in Device Manager does not resolve the problem, and may
cause the keyboard to stop responding, even in Safe mode.

CAUSE
=====

The PS/2 mouse port is not configured correctly on the motherboard.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reconfigure the PS/2 mouse port on the motherboard so that it is configured
correctly. For information about how to do so, please consult the computer's
documentation or manufacturer.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To use a PS/2-style mouse on a computer with an Asus motherboard with an Intel
Triton chip set, you must use a special PS/2-style mouse adapter. If the PS/2
mouse port on the computer is not configured correctly, the port does not
function properly in Windows 95.
