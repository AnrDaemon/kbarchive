SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Dispatch program (DISPATCH.EXE) from the MS-DOS command
prompt under the Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT (NT MMTA), the
following error may be generated:

   No drive is available for dynamic attaching.

Dispatch will check the process table on the home postoffice (PO), but it does
not connect to any of the DrivesUNC postoffices.

The MS-DOS-based version of Dispatch is being executed from the C:\MAILEXE
directory. The DISPATCH.EXE file being used is dated 8/17/94 and size 84,453
bytes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run Dispatch from the C:\MAILEXE\DIRSYNC.NT directory. This will ensure that the

ships with version 3.5 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, is being executed.
