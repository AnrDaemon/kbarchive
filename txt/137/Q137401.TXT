PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:dun 3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient kbDialUp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Dial-Up Networking configured for NetWare Remote Networking (NRN)
to dial into a NetWare Connect 1.0 server, you may be able to connect to the
server, but you may receive the following error message when you try to access
network resources:

   The network is not accessible

CAUSE
=====

The NetWare Connect server is not configured to use the 802.3 frame type. This
does not prevent the Dial-Up Networking client from connecting to the NetWare
Connect server, but it does prevent the client from logging on to the NetWare
network and accessing network resources.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the NetWare Connect server, and at least one network adapter in the
server, to use the 802.3 frame type. This allows the Dial-Up Networking client
to receive SAP broadcasts and log on to the NetWare network. For information
about configuring a NetWare Connect server and a network adapter in the server
to use the 802.3 frame type, contact your network administrator.


NOTE: In Windows 95, the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol bound to the Dial-Up adapter
should also be configured to use the 802.3 frame type. The default setting for
the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol is Auto, which detects the current frame type in
use on the network. To configure the IPX/SPX- compatible protocol to use the
802.3 frame type, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.

2. Click "IPX/SPX-Compatible Protocol -> Dial-Up Networking," and then click
   Properties.

3. Click the Advanced tab.

4. Click Frame Type in the Property box, and then click Ethernet 802.3 in the
   Value box.

5. Click OK.
