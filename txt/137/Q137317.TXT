SYMPTOMS
========

When you use one of the multimedia programs listed at the top of this article,
text appears in the wrong font. This occurs after the program has previously run
correctly.

With Encarta 1997, the following error message is displayed after starting the
program:

Encarta Encyclopedia cannot find one or more of the fonts it uses. Encarta
Encyclopedia will run without these fonts, but some text may not display
properly. To correct the problem, run Setup again from the CD-ROM.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs if Windows TrueType fonts are not active (disabled).

If TrueType fonts are deactivated after the multimedia application is installed,
a substitute bitmap font is used. Depending upon the system, the substituted
font can be random.

RESOLUTION
==========

Activate (enable) TrueType fonts and restart Windows. For more information about
how to accomplish this task in Windows, see your Windows printed documentation
or online help.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The installation of Encarta or Bookshelf requires activating TrueType fonts. If
TrueType fonts are not activated, you are prompted during Setup to activate
them.
