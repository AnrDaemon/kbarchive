======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the sender of a Microsoft Exchange Schedule+ version 7.0 meeting request
reads the acceptance message sent by another Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0
user, the Yes: string common to Microsoft Schedule+ version 1.0 will not appear
in the subject line.

This is by product design.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Schedule+ version 1.x included a Yes: string in the return message.
This is not used by Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0. This version assigns a
yes/no/maybe icon to the return message plus a matching yes/no/tentative line at
the top of the returned invitation.

Additional query words: 7.0
