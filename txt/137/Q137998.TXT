TITLE   :XFOR: Messages to Mac Users Not Processed in FIFO Order
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Messages sent from a Microsoft Exchange Server to a Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk
Networks server via the MS Mail Connector (AppleTalk) MTA are not always
processed in first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If gateway traffic is high and the Macintosh blocking factor (the number of
messages processed by the Macintosh component each cycle) is set to a low value,
the Exchange Server can backfill the gateway queue while the Macintosh gateway
component processes the first group of incoming messages. Messages then placed
in the queue by the Exchange Server can be processed ahead of messages handled
during the previous cycle. This behavior can continue until the backfilling
ceases.

Administrators can reduce this behavior by running the Macintosh Mail client
against the gateway Macintosh server as Network Manager and raise the blocking
factor on Mail menu, by choosing Gateway, Configuration.
