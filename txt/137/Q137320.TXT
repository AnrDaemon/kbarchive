KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to duplicate disks from a disk set generated with the Microsoft
Select compact discs, you may receive the error message:

   Bad/missing sector error

RESOLUTION
==========

To create disks on duplicating machines, use the following steps:

1. Create a 1.2 MB disk set from the Select CD.

2. Create a 1.44 MB disk set by using the XCOPY utility to copy all of files on
   the disks in Step 1 to a 1.44 MB disk set.

3. Use the 1.44 MB disk set created in Step 2 as the master set for use in the
   disk duplicating machine, or use DSKIMAGE to create the *.IMG files provided
   the disk duplicator requires the utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The disk images for some of the products on the Select compact discs are 1.2 MB.
The utility Select uses to create the disks makes a 5.25" or 3.5" disk set that
can be used for installation. For disk duplication machines, there may be a
problem if 5.25" (1.2 MB) disks are not used.
