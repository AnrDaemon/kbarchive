KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows NT Setup on your PC-compatible computer with a Conner
CFP1060S SCSI hard disk installed, the installation of Windows NT fails. If
Setup does not fail, you experience data corruption during normal usage.

CAUSE
=====

The version of your Conner CFP1060S is designed for non PC-compatible computers,
and therefore does not work properly in your PC-compatible computer.

There are two versions of the Conner CFP1060S SCSI hard disk: PC-compatible and
non PC-compatible. To verify that you have the non PC-compatible hard drive
model, check the hard disk interface connector:

 - The non PC-compatible model has an 80-pin connector with an additional
   adapter that converts the 80-pin connector to 50 pins. In addition, this
   drive has the labeling "Conner CFP1060S w/SCA 80pin-50pin adapter."

 - The PC-compatible model has a standard 50-pin SCSI connector.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem if you have the non PC-compatible model, replace it with
a PC-compatible drive.

According to Conner Technical Support the Conner CFP1060S drive has been
discontinued in the 50-pin PC-compatible format.
