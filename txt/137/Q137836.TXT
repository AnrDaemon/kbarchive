SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Setup program (Setup.exe) to install or remove Encarta on a
system running Windows 3.x, you may receive the following error message:

   Setup Message
   Could not open the file named:
   'C:\WINDOWS\MPLAYER.INI'.

You are given the options to Abort, Retry, or Ignore.

If you click Abort, you receive the following error message:

   Setup is not yet complete.
   If you quit now, this product will not be correctly installed.

   Quit the setup of this product?

If you click Retry, nothing occurs.

If you click Ignore once, nothing occurs; however, if you double-click Ignore,
the Setup program completes successfully.

CAUSE
=====

The errors occur if the Mplayer.ini file is marked as read-only.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove the read-only attribute from Mplayer.ini. To do
this, use either of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

To remove the read-only attribute, type the following command at the MS-DOS
prompt, and then press ENTER:

   "attrib -r c:\windows\mplayer.ini" (without the quotation marks)

-or-

Method 2
--------

To remove the read-only attribute using File Manager, follow these steps:

1. Double-click the Windows folder.

2. On the View menu, click Sort By Name.

3. Locate Mplayer.ini and click it.

4. On the File menu, click Properties, and, in the Properties dialog box, under
   Attributes, clear the Read Only check box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error will only occur in Windows 3.1. Windows 95 does not use an Mplayer.ini
file because the Media Player settings in Windows 95 are saved in the Registry.
