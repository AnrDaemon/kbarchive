TITLE   :RAS Not Saving Terminal & Script Options for ISDN or X.25 Ports
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Remote Access Terminal and script features do not work if you use them to
call a remote access server with your ISDN card (for example, a Digiboard ISDN
card) or your X.25 card (for example, an Eicon X.25 card). If you select one of
these features for an item in your list of remote access servers in Remote
Access, your Terminal or script selection is only saved until you quit Remote
Access. When you restart Remote Access your Terminal or script selection is
missing.

NOTE: These features are available with X.25 modem dial-up, because you are using
a serial port on your computer.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, call the remote access server by configuring the
item on your list of remote access servers to use a serial port on your
computer, that is, use a null-modem cable or an internal or external modem to
call the remote access server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
