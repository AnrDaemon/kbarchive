TITLE   :Changing Default Permissions Causes STOP 0xC000021A
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Windows NT the following STOP error message appears:

   STOP 0xC000021A {Fatal System Error}
   The Windows Logon Process system process terminated
   unexpectedly with a status of 0xC0000022 (0x00000000 0x00000000)
   The system has been shutdown.

After Windows NT dumps system memory to disk, the computer restarts and the same
STOP message reappears.

CAUSE
=====

The file and directory permissions may have been changed on the system root
(%SystemRoot%) directory or its subdirectories. Several combinations of
permissions may cause this behavior. For example, if you set file permissions to
Read/Execute or Read-only in the system root directory and all its
subdirectories, the behavior above occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this behavior:

1. Install Windows NT to another directory and start the new version of Windows
   NT.

2. Reset the file and directory permissions of the original Windows NT
   %SystemRoot% directory to the following default permissions:

   NTFS Partition
   --------------

   Change for the Everyone Group

3. Quit the second installation of Windows NT.

4. Restart the original version of Windows NT.

5. Remove the second installation of Windows NT.
