TITLE   :No More Than 16 MB of Memory Reported on Some IBM PS/2 Models
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Windows 95 on one of the following computers with more than
16 MB of RAM, Windows 95 reports that only 16 MB of RAM are present:

 - IBM PS/2 Model 77

 - IBM PS/2 Model 90

 - IBM PS/2 Model 95

 - IBM PS/Note 425 model 2618-M40

CAUSE
=====

These computers use a nonstandard API for reporting memory in excess of 16 MB
that is not supported by Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The computers listed in this article use INT 15 ax=c700h to report memory above
16 MB. (Other IBM PS/2 Microchannel computers may use INT 15 ax=E881.) The
updated version of Himem.sys accepts a /P switch that causes HIMEM to use this
API to detect memory in excess of 16 MB. Without the /P switch, the updated
HIMEM does not use this API, and functions the same as the shipping version of
HIMEM.

The new version of Himem.sys reports itself as version 3.95, the same as the
shipping version.
