TITLE   :DOCERR: DO FORM LINKED Clause Does Not Require a Variable
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Visual FoxPro Help file, and the Language Reference, page 345,
incorrectly document the DO FORM command's LINKED clause.

When the LINKED clause is used, no memory variable name (MemVarName) is needed
after the keyword LINKED. Adding a MemVarName after linked will produce a
"Command contains unrecognized phrase/keyword" error.

NOTE: This was corrected in the Visual FoxPro 3.0b for Windows documentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The LINKED clause stands by itself. Visual FoxPro always creates a MemVar when a
DO FORM command is used. The MemVarName is either derived from the .scx file
name or specified by the user when the optional NAME < MemVarName > clause
is used. All the LINKED clause does is tell Visual FoxPro that the form should
be destroyed when the MemVarName is released.
