TITLE   :NET2182 and NET3546 Errors Appear After LAN Manager 2.2c Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you successfully install LAN Manager 2.2c client software from the Windows
NT Server 3.5 or 3.51 compact disc and restart the client computer, the
following two error messages appear:

   NET2182: The workstation has already been started

   NET3546: Error running C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NETWKSTA.EXE

Whether or not this error occurs depends on your computer configuration.

The protocol installed during LAN Manager Setup may bind successfully to the
network interface card (NIC) driver, but the NET START WORKSTATION command in
AUTOEXEC.BAT fails with the following message:

   The WORKSTATION service is not started.
   Is it OK to start it? (Y/N) [Y]:

If you answer Yes, the error messages above appear again.


CAUSE
=====

The LAN Manager 2.2c client Setup program in the \CLIENTS\LANMAN\DISKS directory
on the Windows NT Server 3.5 and 3.51 compact disc places the NET START
WORKSTATION statement at the end of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. This causes problems
with the Microsoft CD-ROM Extension (MSCDEX.EXE) file because it is not
network-aware.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Use a text editor to modify the client computer's AUTOEXEC.BAT.

2. Place the MSCDEX.EXE line after the NET START WORKSTATION line.

3. Save AUTOEXEC.BAT and quit the editor.

4. Reboot the client computer.
