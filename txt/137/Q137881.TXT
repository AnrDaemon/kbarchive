SYMPTOMS
========

You are unable to copy or print information from online Help.

CAUSE
=====

The Help screens are in the form of DIBs (Device Independent Bitmaps). A .dib
file format is designed to ensure that bitmap graphics created using one program
can be loaded and displayed in another program exactly the way the image
appeared in the originating program. Because of the DIB format, you are unable
to copy or print Help text directly from the program.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can capture the information by pasting an image
of the Help screen into Microsoft Paint (in Windows 95) or Paintbrush (in
Windows 3.x). In Paint (or Paintbrush in Windows 3.x), the file becomes a bitmap
(.bmp) and it can be cropped, sized, printed, or imported into other programs.
Follow these steps to cut and paste the screen to Paint (or Paintbrush):

1. To copy the active window containing the desired text, press ALT+PRINT SCREEN
   on the keyboard.

2. Open Microsoft Paint (or Paintbrush), normally located in the Accessories
   group.

3. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

The picture can be saved and printed as a bitmap image (.bmp).

NOTE: For information about the Copy and Paste commands, see your Windows printed
documentation or online Help.
