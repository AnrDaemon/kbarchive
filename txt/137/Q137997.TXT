TITLE   :XCLN: Message Finder Does Not Save View
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Column changes in the Message Finder dialog box are not saved when you switch
folders.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Windows client does not keep track of changes to the view
descriptors between instances of switching folders in the Message Finder. When
you switch folders in the Message Finder, Exchange reloads the view descriptor
for the folder and uses that as the starting view.

This is by product design.
