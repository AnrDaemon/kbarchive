TITLE   :Program Manager Disappears After Log On, Log Off or Shutdown
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

One or both symptoms may occur in Windows NT 3.51:

 - When you log on, log off, or shut down Windows NT, Program Manager does not
   appear, or disappears. When you press CTRL+ALT+DEL, the Windows NT Security
   dialog box does not appear. Network connections to the Windows NT computer
   can still be made.

 - Program Manager disappears and is not in the task list. Programs already
   started are functional and network connections to the Windows NT computer can
   be made.


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the following events occur:

   - Process A creates cursor
   - Process B references cursor
   - Process A exits

The cursor still points to the freed pointer of process A. If the freed pointer
is uncommitted, any call to FindExistingCursorIcon results in memory access
violation and the calling process is halted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
