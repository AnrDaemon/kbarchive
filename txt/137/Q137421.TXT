The information in this article applies to:

If the PING command is used to a broadcast address, some devices will
respond.

The following RFC section discusses pinging a broadcast address:

   RFC-1122 Section 3.2.2.6 Echo Request/Reply

   "An ICMP Echo Request destined to an IP broadcast or IP multicast address MAY
   be silently discarded.

   DISCUSSION:
   This neutral provision results from a passionate debate between those who feel
   that ICMP Echo to a broadcast address provides a valuable diagnostic
   capability and those who feel that misuse of this feature can too easily
   create packet storms."

Windows NT 3.5 computers do not reply to these PING Echo Requests. Novell
3.12 Servers send an Echo Reply.

Additional query words: prodnt tcp/ip
