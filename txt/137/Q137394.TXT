TITLE   :Long Path Length in cc:Mail Causes GP Fault
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51,4.0,95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a path length in Windows NT or Windows 95 is greater than 126 characters,
Lotus cc:Mail version 2.2 causes a General Protection (GP) fault.

CAUSE
=====

Lotus cc:Mail cannot run if the path contains more than 126 characters. Use the
Path command from a CMD window in Windows NT to view the path. The path cc:Mail
inherits in Windows NT and Windows 95 may be longer than the path created in
AUTOEXEC.BAT.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, reduce the path length to less than 126 characters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The cc:Mail Address Limit section of the Lotus cc:Mail 2.2 README.TXT file
(included with cc:Mail 2.2 Installation disks) mentions that the address line
length (path length) limit is 126 characters.

Additional query words: win95x winnt gpf error message appears
