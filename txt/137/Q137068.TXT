TITLE   :XADM: Err Msg: The Path Specified Is Invalid...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the SETUP.EXE program from the Microsoft Exchange Server
Distribution CD, the following error message is received:

   The Path Specified is Invalid, or Incomplete or Non-Local. Please Specify a
   Valid Path Name.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the SETUP.EXE program installs Microsoft Exchange into the EXCHSRVR
directory on drive C. If you try to change the installation directory to the
root directory of a drive, the above error message is displayed because
Microsoft Exchange cannot be installed in the root directory. The installation
directory specified must be a subdirectory.
