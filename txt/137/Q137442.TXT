SUMMARY
=======

The ReadOnly property appears only on the Column, EditBox, Grid, Spinner, and
TextBox controls. This article explains why.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two properties (ReadOnly and Enabled) that determine whether a control
may be edited.

When the Enabled property of a control is set to false (.F.), the control is not
accessible. The user cannot give it the focus.

When the ReadOnly property is set to true (.T.), the control is not editable.
However, users can give the control the focus, move the insertion point through
the text, and scroll by using scroll bar.

Only those controls that need to provide these kinds of navigation capabilities
while keeping the control non-editable have the ReadOnly property. For the
others, such as the check box, the Enabled property alone is adequate.
