TITLE   :SRV.SYS Error 2023
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51 SP1,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 SP1, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On your multi-processor computer running Windows NT 3.51 and Service Pack 1 this
error message is logged in the system log (as shown in the Event Viewer):

   Error 2023: The server is unable to find a raw work item <X> times in
   the last 60 seconds.

CAUSE
=====

On multi-processor computers, Windows NT evenly distributes RawModeWorkItems
over the processors. With Service Pack 1 installed, if a computer is getting
most of its server requests on one processor, it can run out of RawModeWorkItems
on that processor's queue.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has modified the file, SRV.SYS, so that when a processor runs out of
RawModeWorkItems, it borrows them from another processor's queue.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A fix
to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
