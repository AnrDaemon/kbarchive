The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use IBM LAN Bridge Manager version 2.0 with File and Print Services for
NetWare (FPNW) 3.51, the FPNW server fails to download and update files on the
NetWare client computer (using NETX or VLM).

Bridge Manager software does not copy some of the server based files to the
client.
