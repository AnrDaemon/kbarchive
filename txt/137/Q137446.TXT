-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article compares the Visual FoxPro 3.0 and the FoxPro 2.6 Setup Wizards and
highlights the functionality of the new wizard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The interface and the functionality of the Setup Wizard has changed. Following
are some of the changes for the specified Setup Wizard steps:

Step 2 - Optional Components
----------------------------

NOTE: Check Win32s if you plan to distribute this application to users that have
Windows or Windows for Workgroups.

The differences are:

 - With FoxPro 2.x for Windows, Windows 3.1 is the only platform used for
   distributing application files. In Visual FoxPro 3.0, you can select the
   operating systems on which users can install your application. The Setup
   Wizard will create a setup routine that includes all necessary system files
   for the system features you specify:

    - Win32s

    - Windows 95

    - Windows NT

 - In Visual FoxPro 3.0, you can specify if you want to ship the Visual FoxPro
   3.0 Runtime (Vfp300.esl) with your application files.

 - In Visual FoxPro 3.0, when you select the ODBC Drivers option, the ODBC
   Drivers dialog box appears so that you can select the necessary drivers.

Step 3 - Disk Images
--------------------

The Setup Wizard creates a distribution subdirectory containing disk images for
each type of disk you specify. If you select the Netsetup option, the Setup
Wizard creates a single directory that contains all the files.

Step 4 - Setup Options
----------------------

The Setup Wizard creates installation dialog boxes with the title you specify in
the Dialog Caption box. It also places the copyright statement in the About
Setup dialog box.

Entries are required in the Dialog Caption and Setup Copyright boxes. The
Post-Setup Executable entry is optional.

NOTE: Though this field is optional, the insertion point must enter this field in
order for the Next button to become active.

Step 6 - File Summary
---------------------

This is a new step in the Setup Wizard for Visual FoxPro 3.0. The Setup Wizard
lists your files in a grid. You can change the settings for any file by clicking
the item that you want to change. The following table describes the settings
displayed in each column.

Column      Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

File        The file name as it will be created on the user's computer.

Target Dir  The file can be installed on the user's computer in the
            Application directory, Windows directory, or Windows System
            directory.

PM Item     If you would like the Setup program to create a program group
            and icon, select the PM Item check box for your distributed
            .exe or program file, and then supply the following:

             - A description of the icon.

             - An icon file to represent your exe.

             - A command line to run your .exe file. In the command line,
               you can use an embedded %s sequence to replace the
               application directory. The "s" must be lowercase. Use the %s
               sequence when you install files in application
               subdirectories. This ensures that files are installed in the
               correct subdirectory if users specify a name for the
               application directory other than the default name. For
               example, use the following to run an executable called
               Myapp.exe:

                  %s\Myapp.exe

OLE         If you select this option, the generated setup will register
            the OLE control when it is installed on a user's computer. This
            does not register a design-time license for the control on the
            user's computer. Have your setup program register OLE controls
            to ensure that your user always uses the correct version of the
            control.
