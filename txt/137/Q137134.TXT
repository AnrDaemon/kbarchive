When you run applications under Windows NT 3.51, buttons, fonts, and text in
dialog boxes is misplaced or clipped by another control or the dialog frame. The

drivers, screen resolution, or computer type.

STATUS

researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
