TITLE   :CLIENT.BAT Added Incorrectly to AUTOEXEC.BAT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


Remote Control of Windows for Workgroups client does not work, even after Windows
for Workgroups is rebooted.

CAUSE
=====

CLI_DOS appends the CALL D:\MS\SMS\BIN\CLIENT.BAT line to the end of your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file, after the WIN command. Consequently, CLIENT.BAT runs after
you quit Windows for Workgroups.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file on the client so that
CLIENT.BAT is called before WIN.COM.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
