-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After converting a screen or project from FoxPro version 2.x to Visual FoxPro
version 3.0, you see this error message:

   An error occurred in the Converter and it cannot continue. The error has been
   logged in <path>\error.log. Open the logfile?

If you click Yes, an empty log file is displayed. There is not any information
about the actual error that occurred.

CAUSE
=====

The disk is full, and the converter application cannot write to the log file.

WORKAROUND
==========

Free up disk space for the converter to complete successfully.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows. Visual FoxPro 5.0 displays the following message when the target
disk is full: "The disk is full, and the converter cannot continue. The log file
cannot be saved to disk."


MORE INFORMATION
================

A functional conversion creates form and control images and copies code to
locations in object properties, events, and methods. In addition, Convert.app
creates a backup copy of the FoxPro 2.x files.

Steps to Reproduce Problem

1. Fill up a partition on your hard disk.

2. Convert a FoxPro version 2.x screen or project.

3. Choose to perform a functional conversion.
