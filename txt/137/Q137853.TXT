If a Windows NT FTP server has the guest account enabled with no password
assigned, anyone can log on to the server using FTP without knowing a
username or password. This situation occurs even if the FTP Server Service
is configured for "Allow Anonymous Connections" using a username and
password.

To prevent unauthorized connections to the FTP server, do one of the
following:

 - Disable the guest account.

 - Place a password on the guest account.

 - Configure the FTP Service to Allow Only Anonymous Connections by placing a
   username and password on the account.

For more information on configuring the FTP Server Service, see Chapter 7,
"Using the Microsoft FTP Server Service," in the Windows NT Server "TCP/IP"
manual.
