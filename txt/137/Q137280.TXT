======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 95 The Complete Interactive Multimedia Encyclopedia for Macintosh 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Picture frames in Encarta appear as gray boxes without pictures and contain the
following message:

   The image requested could not be loaded.

If you click the gray box, the following error message appears:

   The image file cannot be displayed. File is missing or there is not enough
   memory available.

Text and other media such as maps, animations, sounds, video, interactivities,
charts and tables function normally.

CAUSE
=====

The problem may occur if the FIF Component has been disabled, deleted, or moved
out of the Macintosh Extensions folder.

The FIF Component is a tool used for decompressing the graphic images used by
Encarta. If the FIF component is not in the Extensions folder when you start the
computer, the graphics files used by Encarta 1995 are not decompressed and
displayed properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, locate the FIF Component on your computer, move it to
the Extensions folder and restart the machine. At the Finder level, you can use
Find from the File menu to help locate the FIF Component.

If the file has been deleted or is missing, copy the file from the Encarta
CD-ROM. The file is located in the System Files folder, which is in the
Installer Files folder. The FIF Component can be copied from the Encarta CD- ROM
directly into the Extensions folder on the Macintosh.

For more information about how to accomplish this task, see your Macintosh
printed documentation or online help.
