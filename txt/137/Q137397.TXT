SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the Migration Tool for NetWare (Nwconv.exe) to migrate a
Novell NetWare server to a computer running Windows NT Server, you may receive
the following error message:

   <ntserver_name> is not a server

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the computer you are attempting to migrate to is not a
domain controller. The Migration Tool for NetWare does not allow migration of a
NetWare server to a non-domain controller.

RESOLUTION

Perform the migration of the NetWare server to a computer that is a primary
domain controller (PDC) or a backup domain controller (BDC).
