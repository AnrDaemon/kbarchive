When you send a message from Microsoft Exchange to a distribution list from a
CompuServe address book, you may receive the following undeliverable mail
message from the Microsoft Exchange System Administrator:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.
   The following recipients could not be reached. Group deleted from

address book. When this error occurs, the empty distribution list is displayed.

contains valid entries. If a group does not contain valid entries, remove it

researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
