TITLE   :Batch Installation Over Windows 95 May Disable Network Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet msnets win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Msbatch.inf batch installation file to install Windows 95 over an
existing version of Windows 95, you may no longer be able to connect to the
network.

CAUSE
=====

If the "clients=" setting in the Msbatch.inf file is set to the correct network
type, Setup installs the correct network client. However, Setup then detects the
network type installed in the previous version of Windows 95, and tries to
install the client again. Installing the client software again causes the
corresponding registry entry to be damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

Follow these steps to correct the problem:

1. Edit the registry and delete either of the following registry keys:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Enum\Network\VREDIR (for the Microsoft Network
      client)

      -or-

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Enum\Network\NWREDIR (for the NetWare client)

   For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
   Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
   should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
   before you edit the registry.

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
   require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
   resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
   Registry Editor at your own risk.

2. Without restarting your computer, double-click the Network icon in Control
   Panel. You may receive an error message about an incomplete network setup.

3. Click Add, click Client, click Add, click Microsoft, and the click the
   appropriate network client.

4. Click OK until you return to Control Panel.

5. When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot simply specify the network client type in the Msbatch.inf batch
installation file. Windows 95 Setup detects and installs the previously
installed client. The "clients=" line in the .inf file should contain no client
IDs.
