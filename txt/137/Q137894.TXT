When you run Systems Management Server Setup, it fails to generate an error

least one existent (valid) component. Instead, Systems Management Server Setup
generates a message that it added all components successfully, even though the
list contains non-existent components that Setup fails to add.

Setup fails to check if the individual components are added successfully.

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
