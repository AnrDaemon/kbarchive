The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Visual FoxPro 3.0 Setup Wizard does not require that an application (.app)
file be specified. This article describes how to cause a generated setup to
search for a specific file to determine if the application exists on the target
computer.

NOTE: Modifications to Wzsetup.ini are not supported by Microsoft FoxPro
Technical Support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FoxPro 2.6 Setup Wizard required that a specific .app or .exe be identified
as the application file. This file was used in the command for the Program
Manager item.

The Visual FoxPro 3.0 Setup Wizard allows many Program Manager items to be
created and does not require that a single .app or .exe be selected as the
application file. As a result, the generated setup does not know which specific
file to search for to determine if the application exists on the target
directory.

You can, however, modify the ApplicationName setting in the Preferences section
of Wzsetup.ini as follows to cause the generated setup program to look for a
specific file and display a warning to the user if the file is found:

      [Preferences]
      ApplicationName=Myapp.app

When the generated setup runs, it will look for Myapp.app in the default
installation directory.
