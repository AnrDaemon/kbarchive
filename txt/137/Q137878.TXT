======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The files on the PowerPoint for Windows 95 CD-ROM and Office for Windows 95
CD-ROM are not compressed. If you need to copy an individual file from one of
these compact discs, you can simply copy it from the disc and use it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PowerPoint for Windows 95 and Office for Windows 95 on floppy disks use
Distribution Media Format (DMF) disks. DMF allows more contents to be stored on
a high-density disk by removing normal sector boundaries. Each disk (except Disk
1) has a single file with a .cab (Cabinet File) extension. To copy individual
files from these disks, you must use Extract.exe, found on Disk 1. You do not
have to use Extract.exe with the compact disc versions of these products.
