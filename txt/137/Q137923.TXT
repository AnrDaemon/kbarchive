SYMPTOMS
========

On your computer that is running Windows NT and has the Compaq NetFlex32
integrated Ethernet adapter in the motherboard, when you install the Compaq-
supplied Support Software Diskette (SSD) drivers for the NetFlex and NetFlex3
cards, your network card fails to function.

CAUSE
=====

The Compaq-supplied SSD drivers for the NetFlex and NetFlex3 cards are not
designed to work with the integrated Netflex32 Ethernet adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

Compaq recommends the PCNTN3.SYS driver for use with the NetFlex32 integrated
Ethernet adapter with Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51.

To install the PCNTN3.SYS drivers:

1. Run Control Panel and choose Network.

2. Choose Add Adapter.

3. From the drop-down list box of adapters select "<Other> Requires disk
   from manufacturer".

4. Insert the SSD 1.15 disk into drive A and choose Continue.

5. Select the PCNTN3.SYS driver located on the SSD disk in \NET\PCNTN3
   directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use SSD 1.15 or later with Windows NT 3.51.
Use SSD 1.14 with Windows NT 3.5.

Compaq SSDs are available from the Compaq BBS at (713)378-1418 or on CompuServe
