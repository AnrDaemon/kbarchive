SUMMARY
=======

Xircom provides a modem script and support files for use with their PCMCIA CEM2
CreditCard + Ethernet modem and Mail Remote for Windows.

The script is available as XIRMDM.EXE from the Xircom forum on CompuServe (GO
XIRCOM) and from the Xircom BBS (805) 376-9130.


XIRMDM.EXE is a self-extracting archive that contains the following files:

   XIRMDM   EXE        28,264  07-18-95  9:34a
   XIRCBAN  SCT         6,534  01-27-95  8:34a
   XIRCLOT  MDM         4,234  01-25-95  2:54p

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. To install the script from XIRMDM.EXE, extract the XIRCMSM.SCR file by typing
   "XIRMDM.EXE" (without the quotation marks).

2. Copy the XIRCMSM.SCR to the MS Mail Data Disk used by the administrator to
   set up clients. This will allow the Xircom Modem to appear as a choice during
   setup.

As with all PCMCIA cards, it is important that the PCMCIA drivers are configured
properly in order for the PCMCIA slot and card to function.

XIRMDM.EXE and all files contained within are supported by Xircom. Microsoft
