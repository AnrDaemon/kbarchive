TITLE   :PRB: Early Binding Fails with Out-Of-Process OLE Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When performing early binding on an out-of-process OLE server class, you might
expect the Visual Basic 4.0 compiler to detect references made to invalid
methods or properties. Yet, sometimes such invalid references are ignored by the
compiler and are only detected at run time.

CAUSE
=====

There are two probable causes for this problem:

 - Improper declaration of object variable. For early binding to work, you must
   declare your object variable as follows:

         Dim MyObjectVar As New MyServer.MyClass

   If you use the following, early binding will not work:

         Dim MyObjectVar As Object

-or-

 - Compile On Demand option is set on. Click Options on the Tools menu, and
   click the Advanced tab. The Compile On Demand option must be set to false for
   the compiler to detect references made to invalid methods or properties in
   the server class.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
