TITLE   :BUG: HalfHeight Forms Closable Even If Closable = False
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbcode kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bug kbvfpkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a form with a halfheight title bar and set the Closable property
of the form to false (.F.), you can still close the form.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid the problem, use the QueryUnload event. Put a NODEFAULT in its code to
make it impossible to close the form:

      x = CREATEOBJECT( 'myform' )
      x.Show
      READ EVENTS

      DEFINE CLASS myform AS Form

        HalfHeightCaption = .t.

        Add Object cmdclose AS CommandButton
        cmdclose.Caption = "Close"

        PROCEDURE cmdclose.click
             thisform.release
        ENDPROC

        PROCEDURE QueryUnload
             NODEFAULT
        ENDPROC

        PROCEDURE Destroy
             CLEAR EVENTS
        ENDPROC

      ENDDEFINE

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem seems to occur more often when Visual FoxPro is run in Windows 95
rather than Windows NT 4.0. However, the problem may still occur in Windows NT
4.0, usually in Visual FoxPro 5.x. Visual FoxPro 3.0b rarely, if ever, exhibits
the problem when run under Windows NT 4.0.


Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Execute the following in the Command window:

      oForm = CREATEOBJECT('Form')
      oForm.HalfHeightCaption = .T.
      oForm.Closable = .F.
      oForm.Show()
      READ EVENTS

Double-click the form's control box to close the form. Although the form appears
to close, the READ EVENTS is still in effect. To clear the READ EVENTS and
return to the Command window, choose Cancel from the Program menu.
