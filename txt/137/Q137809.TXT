PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbvfp kbvfp300bFIX kbDSupportkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The error "Insufficient Memory" displays when you attempt to start a Visual
FoxPro 3.0 session. The computer has 512 megabytes (MB) of RAM, or more, and
should have enough memory for Visual FoxPro to start.

NOTE: In Visual FoxPro 3.0, the insufficient memory message does not occur on
computers with less than 512 MB of RAM.

NOTE: In Visual FoxPro 3.0b, the insufficient memory message does not occur on
computers with less than 768 MB of RAM.


RESOLUTION
==========

If you are using Microsoft Windows NT, you can limit the amount of memory used
by the operating system. You can create a boot (in the Boot.ini file) that uses
a special configuration for Visual FoxPro. To limit the amount of memory that
Windows NT uses, use the MaxMem switch. Using a trial and error method,
determine the maximum amount of memory you can use before you receive the
"Insufficient Memory" error when launching Visual FoxPro.

For more information about multi-boot and the MaxMem switch, please see the
Windows NT documentation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual FoxPro
5.0a for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Install Visual FoxPro on a computer that has 512 megabytes of RAM.

2. Start Visual FoxPro. The "Insufficient memory" error appears, and Visual
   FoxPro cannot start.
