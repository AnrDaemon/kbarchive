TITLE   :Int21 Random Write Fails Under Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An Int21 call, Random Write (22H), from a client running Windows for Workgroups
or Windows95 to Windows NT fails. As a result, if you run an older application
on the client that relies on the Int21 call, you cannot write to a network drive
on computer running Windows NT server.

CAUSE
=====

Reading the trace on SMB Response Open&X from Windows NT, the Open Mode is
0x00FF instead of 0x0072.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use Handler functions instead of FCB calls.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the fix mentioned below.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A fix
to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
