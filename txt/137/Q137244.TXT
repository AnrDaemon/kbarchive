The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Windows 95 with a LANtastic network, you may be unable to
access the network after running the Network Troubleshooter.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if both the LANtastic network client software and the
Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks is installed. The LANtastic network
client software cannot be run in conjunction with support for other networks.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks. To do so, follow these
steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, and then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

2. Click Client For Microsoft Networks, and then click Remove.

3. Click OK.


MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot install another network client while the LANtastic client software is
installed. However, when you use the Network Troubleshooter, you may be asked if
you want to install the Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks. If you choose
Yes, the troubleshooter installs the client software.

To start the Network Troubleshooter, view the Troubleshooting Network Problems
online Help topic.
