PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51 95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOM
-------

When you use an SMC 8416 EtherEZ network card, you can only use default
values of the card. When you change the configuration by running Control
Panel, choosing Network, and then Configure, or if you use the
configuration program that ships with the adapter, your configuration
attempt fails.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by the Plug and Play (PNP) capabilities of the card and the Plug
and Play BIOS of the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following information has been provided by Standard Microsystems technical
support and is not guaranteed to be correct by Microsoft Corporation.

To resolve this problem, turn off the PNP capabilities of the adapter. Some
computer CMOS programs allow you to turn off the PNP capability of the BIOS but
this can have unexpected results on other adapters.

Depending on the operating system running on your computer, use one of the
following procedures with EZSETUP.EXE to disable the PNP capabilities of the
network card:

 - If your computer is configured for dualboot, for example, MS-DOS and Windows
   NT, boot to MS-DOS and type "EZSETUP -nopnp" (without the quotation marks).

   -or-

 - If your computer is running Windows NT or Windows 95, boot with an MS-DOS
   bootable floppy with EZSETUP.EXE on the floppy and type "EZSETUP -nopnp"
   (without the quotation marks).

You can obtain EZSETUP.EXE by downloading the self-extracting executable
GEZ121.EXE from the SMC BBS at (516) 434-3162 or from the following Internet
site:
