TITLE   :Some Mapped NetWare Drives Incorrect in Windows Explorer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the MAP command in a login script to map a network drive to a
directory on a NetWare server, the drive you have mapped may appear in Windows
Explorer and My Computer as the root of the volume instead of the current
directory. For example, a drive mapped as

   MAP SYS:<directory>\<subdirectory>

may appear as:

   \\<server>\SYS

CAUSE
=====

Windows Explorer displays the root of the mapped drive rather than the current
directory (as in earlier versions of Windows). This behavior is by design.


RESOLUTION
==========

To see the current directory of mapped drives, use either of the following
methods:

 - Use Novell NetWare's MAP command at a command prompt.

 - Use File Manager (Winfile.exe) from an earlier version of Windows.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that the issues described in this article do not change the functionality
of NetWare utilities, batch files based on the current directory, or the MAP
command itself. These issues affect only the way that Windows Explorer, or other
Windows 95 tools that use Windows Explorer, displays the drive mappings.
