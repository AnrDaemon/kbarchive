======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT version 3.51, Setup prompts you for a Product
Identification Number. However, the Product Identification Number is not on the
back cover of the Windows NT Workstation 3.51 "Installation Guide," where it
should be located.

CAUSE
=====

In a limited number of cases, the Product Identification Number was not printed
on the cover of the Installation Guide.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not enter any number in the Product Identification Number dialog box, choose
the OK button and continue Setup.

NOTE: You do not need to enter a number in the Product Identification Number
dialog box to complete Setup. Not entering this number does not affect the
functionality of Windows NT.
