Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Works version 4.0 for Windows 95, you may receive
the following error message when you try to spell-check a message in Microsoft
Exchange:

   The spelling operation could not be completed. No custom dictionary has been
   opened.

   Microsoft Exchange client - 10083 - [81002763]

CAUSE
=====

The Custom Dictionaries key in the registry has been set incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

To correct this problem, follow these steps:

1. Add a Custom Dictionaries key to the following registry branch:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Proofing Tools

2. Add the following string value for the Custom Dictionaries key:

   1

3. Set the string value of 1 to

   <path to Custom.dic>:\custom.dic

   where <path to Custom.dic> is the path to your custom dictionary file.

   In most cases, the path is:

   C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Proof\Custom.dic


MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that this problem has been corrected in Microsoft Works version 4.0a for
Windows 95.

Before you change the registry, you should back up the registry files. For
