======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Automap Streets for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The "Detail" and "Detailed View" options referred to on the back cover of the
Microsoft Automap Streets box, Part No. 62031, do not exist as ready- made
options in Automap. You can however, create similar views.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The views shown on the product box have been custom created within the Automap
and appear to resemble an Automap Road Atlas feature. If you want these views,
you must create them yourself.

Creating a Custom Detailed View Window
--------------------------------------

1. On the Window menu, click New.

   NOTE: The New option creates a new window that displays a map view similar to
   the main map view window referred to as Map View 1.

2. On the Window menu, click Name Map.

3. In the Map Name field enter "Detailed View" (without the quotation marks) and
   click OK. The title on the new map view changes to Detailed View.

4. Use the Zoom In button on the toolbar or press the F6 function key to Zoom In
   to a closer view.
