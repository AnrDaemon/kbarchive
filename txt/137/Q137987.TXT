TITLE   :NET VIEW May Cause Semaphore Time Out and Event ID 3210
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run NET VIEW \\<computer name>, where <computer name> is a
backup domain controller (BDC), a Semaphore Time Out error message appears and
Event ID 3210 appears in the Event Viewer with the following description:

   Failed to authenticate with <computer name>, a Windows NT domain
   controller for domain <domain name>.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the Netlogon service fails on the BDC.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Check the Event Viewer for any Netlogon events. Read the detail description
   of the event. Query the Microsoft Knowledge Base with the Event ID number or
   any keywords for a possible resolution.

2. Make sure the primary domain controller (PDC) is running Windows NT 3.5 with
   Service Pack 2 installed, or a later version of Windows NT. For additional
   information, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q123155
   TITLE : Err Msg: The Remote Computer is Not Available

   ARTICLE-ID: Q126752
   TITLE : DCs Fail to Synchronize or Validate Users Over NWLINK

3. Try to start Netlogon on the problem BDC. If Netlogon fails to start do the
   following:

   a. Create a new computer name (Use Server Manager).

   b. Synchronize entire domain (check another BDC's event viewer to see if it
      synchronized).

   c. At the problem BDC, change the name to the new name created in Step A (use
      Control Panel Network).

   d. Shutdown the BDC, reboot, and log on to Windows NT. Note any error
      messages.

   e. Synchronize the entire domain (Use Server Manager).

   f. From the PDC, delete the old computer name (Use Server Manager).

   g. Synchronize the entire domain (Use Server Manager).

   h. Make sure the list is out of server manager before proceeding.

   i. After the old BDC name is gone from the Server Manager, recreate it.

   j. Synchronize the entire domain (User Server Manager).

   k. At the problem BDC, change computer name to the old name created in step I
      in Control Panel Network.

   l. Shutdown the BDC, reboot, and log on to Windows NT. Note any error
      messages.

   m. Synchronize entire domain.
