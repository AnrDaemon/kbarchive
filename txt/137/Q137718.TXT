SUMMARY
=======

On page 534, the Systems Management Server "Administrator's Guide" incorrectly
states that /DELETE is a valid command line option for APPCTL:

   /delete

   Removes all SMS program groups from the Program Manager and from the local
   registry.

The correct command line option is the following:

   /deinstall

The SMS Help file (SMS.HLP) lists the correct command line option for APPCTL.
