======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Documents that ship with the Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual FoxPro
version 3.0 for Windows and the Visual FoxPro Help file incorrectly list the
ConnectName property as being available with the SQLGETPROP() function. However,
using the ConnectName property with SQLGetProp results in this error:

   Incorrect Property Name

The ConnectName property can be used with the CURSORGETPROP() function to return
the result that would be expected with the SQLGETPROP() function.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Use the ODBC Administrator to establish a data source, and assign it a name.
   One of the tables within Testdata.dbc can be copied to a type FOX2X to be
   used in this example as follows:

      USE C:\Vf\Samples\Data\Customer.dbf
      COPY TO odbctest TYPE FOX2X

2. After the data source has been set up with the ODBC Administrator, create and
   run a program containing this code:

      handle=SQLConnect("<Data_Source_Name>")
      =SQLExec(handle,"USE odbctest")
      =SQLExec(handle,"SELECT * FROM odbctest")
      ? SQLGetProp(handle,"ConnectName")       && This will produce the
                                               && error:
                                               && "Incorrect Property Name"
