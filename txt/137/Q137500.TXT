PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

All messages received on the SSCP-LU session via SLI_OPEN or SLI_RECEIVE API
calls are truncated to 256 bytes of data. The SLI_OPEN returns with AP_OK while
SLI_RECEIVE returns the following error message:

   LUA_DATA_TRUNCATED.

This problem occurs with the SNA Server Windows 3.x and Win32 SLI API interfaces.

CAUSE
=====

This is a problem in the SLI library. It is limiting the size of SLI_RECEIVEs on
the normal SSCP flow to 256 bytes, whereas many hosts send larger RUs than this
on the SSCP-LU session.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the files, WINSLI.DLL and WINSLI32.DLL, to correct this
problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
