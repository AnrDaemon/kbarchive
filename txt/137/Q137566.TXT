SYMPTOM
-------

From your Macintosh computer, when you print a document containing color to
a non postscript color printer that is shared under Windows NT, your
document prints only in gray-scale black and white.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT Services for the Macintosh by design does not provide Macintosh
clients the ability to print in color to non postscript color printers that are
shared under Windows NT.

When Services for the Macintosh converts the file, the color option is converted
to a gray scale print job in the printer control language (PCL). The Windows NT
TrueImage Raster Image Processor (RIP) for non postscript printers only supports
Level 1 Postscript.
