The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you want to use the United Kingdom (U.K.) version of the spelling
dictionary with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, you must make sure that the
WIN.INI and MSMAIL.INI files are pointed to the correct .DLL files.

NOTE: The spelling lines are one continuous line. They have been wrapped in this
article for display purposes.

Microsoft Mail puts special Spelling and Custom Dict 1 entries into the WIN.INI
file (other Microsoft products share a single Spelling and Custom Dict 1 entry).
For example, Microsoft Mail adds the following three lines to the [MS Proofing
Tools] section of the WIN.INI file:

   [MS Proofing Tools]
   Spelling (Mail) 1033,0=C:\WIN31\MSAPPS\PROOF\MSSPELL.DLL,
   C:\WIN31\MSAPPS\PROOF\MSSP_AM.LEX
   Custom Dict 1=C:\WIN31\MSAPPS\PROOF\CUSTOM.DIC

NOTE: Microsoft Mail does not modify existing Microsoft Windows applications to
provide spell checking for the Mail clients.

The MSMAIL.INI file also needs to have the following entry:

   [MS Proofing Tools]
   Spelling=<keyname>

This entry specifies the name of an entry in the [MS Proofing Tools] section of
your WIN.INI file. This entry gives the path to the spelling checker DLL file.

There is no default value. The purpose of this entry is to let Mail use the same
spelling checker you may already be using with another Microsoft application,
such as Microsoft Word for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to only use the U.K. version of the spelling files for Microsoft Mail,
the following line needs to be in the WIN.INI file:

   Spelling (Mail) 1033,0=C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\PROOF\MSSPELL.DLL
   C:\WIN31\MSAPPS\PROOF\MSSP_BR.LEX

The MSSP_BR.LEX should be in place instead of the default file MSSP_AM.LEX.

Also, ensure that the file does exist in the above directory.

In addition, the following line will need to be in the MSMAIL.INI file:

   [MS Proofing Tools]
   Spelling=Spelling (Mail) 1033,0
