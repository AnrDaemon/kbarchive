OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

MONITOR.EXE and DATALOG.EXE are included with the Microsoft Windows NT Resource
Kit. These utilities allow Performance Monitor to start as a service and
automatically append information to a log file. The service starts and stops
correctly, but generates event 7005 in the system log each time it is stopped.
The description in the event is:

   The RpcImpersonateClient call failed with the following error:
   No security context is available to allow impersonation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
