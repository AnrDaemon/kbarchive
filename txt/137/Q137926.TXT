SYMPTOMS
========

Underlining is not printed with the Courier typeface if you are using the IBM
40x9 series of drivers to print to an IBM 40x9 series printer.

IBM 40x9 series printers include the IBM 4019 and 4029 printers.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 3.51 does not correctly issue the underline command to the printer
during the printing process.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the program font to the Courier New typeface
that uses True Type instead of the printer-resident Courier typeface.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Printer-resident Courier typefaces include the following:

Courier 10
Courier 10 Bold
Courier 12
Courier 17*1
