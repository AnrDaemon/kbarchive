TITLE   :STOP 0x0000007F on Pentium Pro Systems Running Windows NT 3.51
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Pentium Pro systems running Windows NT 3.51 and using Halmps.dll, which is the
Hardware Abstraction Layer DLL for most Intel multiprocessor systems, or
Halapic.dll, the uniprocessor version of the same HAL, may experience repeated
STOP 0x0000007F (UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP) errors.

CAUSE
=====

Hardware interrupts are not being disabled at the appropriate time, resulting in
the possibility of a stack fault, given the timing characteristics of the
Pentium Pro processor.

NOTE: The same STOP code may also result from other causes, so the fix mentioned
here will not resolve all instances of this problem. For more information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
