TITLE   :PPT7: How to Copy Multiple Slides into a Word Document.
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbole

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you copy more than one slide from the Slide Sorter and paste it into a
non-PowerPoint file, such as a Word document, you see only the first slide. If
you double-click the image of the first slide, PowerPoint starts and runs a
slide show of the slides that you copied.

CAUSE
=====

PowerPoint provides two kinds of OLE objects: slides and presentations. Both
types of objects appear in your Word document as a single slide. You create a
PowerPoint slide object by copying a single slide from the Slide Sorter and
pasting it into another document. You create a PowerPoint presentation object by
copying several slides from the slide sorter and pasting them into another
document.

RESOLUTION
==========

To have more than one slide image appear in your Word document, copy the slides
one at a time from Slide Sorter view.

REFERENCES
==========

If you want an image of every slide in a presentation sent to a Word document,
you can click Write Up on the Tools menu in PowerPoint.

For more information about the Write-up feature, click Contents And Index on the
Help menu, click the Index tab in PowerPoint Help, type the following text

   "Write-up" (without the quotation marks)

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Create speaker notes and
handouts" topic.
