TITLE   :Change in WINS Search Order from Windows NT 3.5 to 3.51
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Windows NT 3.5 computer only uses the Secondary Windows Internet Name
Service (WINS) server for NetBIOS name resolution when it does not receive
a response from the Primary WINS Server. If a NetBIOS name is not found in
the primary WINS database, Windows NT 3.5 does not search the secondary
WINS server.

The search order in Windows NT 3.51 and above now uses the Secondary WINS
server when the Primary does not respond or when the requested name is
not found in the Primary WINS Server database.

NOTE: This new search order also applies to Windows 95 and Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 (using TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups version 3.11b
and the updated redirector files).

Additional query words: prodnt tcp/ip win95 client
