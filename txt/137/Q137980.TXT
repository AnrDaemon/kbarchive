PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to a Windows 95 user-level network share from a
computer running Windows NT on another domain, and you do not have access
privileges to the network share, the following error message appears:

   You do not have permission to access this directory.

However, if you disconnect and connect as a user with access privileges in File
Manager, the following error message appears with an OK button:

   An unexpected network error has occurred.

In addition, Event ID 3012 appears in the Windows NT Event Viewer with the
following description:

   An unexpected network error has occurred on the virtual circuit to
   <computer name>.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, choose OK in the error message dialog box. You now
have access to resources on the Windows 95 share.

To prevent these error messages from appearing, Microsoft has released a new
version of the Vserver.vxd (4.00.953) file. This file is available in the
Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1 Update Setup.exe file.

For information about Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   an empty folder.

2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the Setup.exe file.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen.

4. After the installation process is finished, shut down and then restart your
