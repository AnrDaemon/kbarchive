The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you download birthdays and anniversaries to the Timex DataLink watch, the
data appears randomly. When you scroll through the dates in Anniversary mode,
some dates are apparently skipped.

CAUSE
=====

The anniversary and birthday lists are combined into a single list viewed in
anniversary mode. The following sort criteria are used:

 - Current year birthday

 - Current year anniversary

 - Next birthday occurrence

 - Next anniversary occurrence

With every viewing of the entire list, the date is incremented to the next year.

NOTE: Currently, the Timex DataLink watch is only supported with the Windows 95
client.

================

Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
