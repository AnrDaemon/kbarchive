PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you click Stop, or click Pause and then click Exit, while you are
recompressing files with Compression Agent, you receive the following message:

   Compression Agent has not finished recompressing drive <drive>.

   You can resume work on drive <drive>, select a different drive, or exit.
   Your choice will not affect the work Compression Agent has already completed
   on drive <drive>.

If you then click Select Drive, Compression Agent may not give you the option to
recompress a different drive. Instead, the compression process may stop.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when you run Compression Agent on a computer with only
one compressed drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent the compression process from being stopped, click Resume instead of
Select Drive.

NOTE: There is no risk of data loss if you click Select Drive and the compression
process stops. To restart the compression process, click Start in the main
Compression Agent window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Select Drive button is intended to let you select a different compressed
drive to recompress on computers with more than one compressed drive.
