PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to configure the Mail Gateway to X.400 using TP4/CLNS over a 3Com
Etherlink II (assy 2227-04 rev.F) or 3Com Etherlink II TP (assy 8782- 01
rev.d1), the gateway may hang while initializing.

WORKAROUND
==========

Try to run the GETMAC.EXE utility (C:\TP4\UTIL\), included with the X.400
Gateway. If this utility also hangs, then remove the 3Com card and substitute a
different card.

NOTE: At this time, the above cards are the only ones known to have this
conflict.
