      Private Sub Form_Click()
         Ole1.Close
      End Sub

   select either a Microsoft Excel 5.0 Worksheet or Microsoft Excel 5.0 Chart.

4. Run the program.

5. To activate the OLE object, press the right mouse button, and click Open. Set
   the focus back to Form1, and execute the Form_Click event procedure.

6. Repeat Step 5 and the GP fault occurs.
