-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 2.5, 2.51, 2.52, 2.6, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Both outbound and inbound e-mail messages have size limits using your MSN
Internet Access e-mail account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The message size shown in the Inbox, Outbox, or other mail folder is the
uncompressed message size. The message size shown in Remote Mail is the
compressed message size.

Outbound Messages
-----------------

Outbound e-mail messages cannot be larger than 1 MB (including header, body, and
attachments). If a message is larger, it is sent back to your Inbox with an
explanation.

The 3-MB limit is based on the compressed size of the message as it is handled by
The Microsoft Network. It is therefore possible to send a message with a large
size as reported by Microsoft Exchange's Outbox folder, because the message is
not yet compressed. The parts compressed are the files, objects, and messages
inserted using the Message command on the Insert menu. The text body is not
compressed.

Inbound Messages
----------------

Internet messages received by The Microsoft Network are also limited to 1 MB for
the entire message and 8K for the message's text body. Internet mail is not
compressed because attachments are text encoded using UUENCODE. If a message
received from the Internet exceeds 3 MB, The Microsoft Network sends the
appropriate error code to the sending service. It is that service's
responsibility to inform the sender that the message was not sent.
