The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS allows you to use Novell's IPXODI-based
IPX/SPX protocol and MLID to access Microsoft network resources.

To access both Microsoft network resources and Novell servers from other MS-
DOS-based clients, you must run multiple protocols and Novell's ODINSUP
driver (which allows you to use the Novell MLID). This configuration uses
more conventional memory than the MS-DOS Network Client 3.0 and the IPX/SPX
Support Driver.

To Configure Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS to use the IPX/SPX Support
Driver and Novell's MLID and IPX/SPX so it can communicate on a Microsoft
NetBIOS based network:

1. Install Novell's IPXODI networking support and verify it is functioning
   properly.

2. Run Setup from the Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS 3.0 disks or from the
   \CLIENTS\MSCLIENT\NETSETUP directory on the Windows NT Server CD-ROM disc.

3. Setup will automatically select the IPX/SPX Support Driver as both the
   Network Card driver and the default protocol. Accept the defaults.
