TITLE   :Proteon 1390 Fails to Initialize During Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows NT Setup on your computer with a Proteon 1390 Token Ring
adapter installed, errors appear during the initialization of the Proteon 1390
Token Ring adapter and the adapter initialization fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - If you do not plan to set up Windows NT Server as a backup domain controller
   (BDC):

   Ignore the errors during Setup and continue with the installation.
   The driver functions properly after you reboot your computer in spite of the
   errors during Setup.

   -or-

 - If you plan to set up Windows NT as a BDC:

   It is necessary that your adapter initializes during Setup so it can contact
   the primary domain controller (PDC) for security purposes. For this reason,
   temporarily install another supported Token Ring adapter before you run
   Windows NT Setup. After Windows NT is installed, replace the existing adapter
   and driver with the Proteon 1390 adapter.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
