-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run the SendMail macro, included with Mail for Windows, you may
get the following error message:

   Unable to load specified library

CAUSE
=====

Included with the client software in version 3.x of Mail for Windows are the
following files:

   SMIAUTO.DOC
   SMIINST.DOT

These are Microsoft Word version 2.0 for Windows files that install a Word macro
called SendMail. This macro allows a Word document to be sent as a mail
attachment from within Word.

This macro was intended for use with Word for Windows version 2.0 and will not
work with Word for Windows 95. Instead, use the Send command from the File menu.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the Send command from the File menu instead of
using the SendMail macro.
