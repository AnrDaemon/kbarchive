The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Installing Windows 95 on older AMS computers with AMS motherboards (version C)
and the following BIOS revisions causes the computer's BIOS to be overwritten:

 - 1.70

 - 1.90

 - 2.01

The Windows 95 Setup process finishes correctly, but the computer fails to boot
when you cycle the computer off and on and the computer runs its BIOS Power-On
Self Test (POST).

NOTE: AMS computers with AMS motherboards (version C) using the BIOS versions
listed above are not on the Windows 95 Hardware Compatibility List and are not
compatible with Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

AMS confirms that the motherboard and BIOS versions listed above are not
compatible with Windows 95 and cause the BIOS to be overwritten. This causes the
computer to fail to boot.

Please contact AMS for information about products compatible with Windows 95, and
about problems resulting from the installation of Windows 95.

Note that the AMS motherboards discussed in this article are also used in Austin
P5 486/50 and P5 486/66 laptop computers.
