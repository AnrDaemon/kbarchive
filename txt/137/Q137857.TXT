TITLE   :Errorlevel Paradigm Behaves Differently in Windows NT 3.51
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The value returned to the operating system by a 16-bit application when it
closes is called an error level. The values that Windows NT 3.51 returns is
different than those returned by OS/2 1.3 and Windows NT 3.5. For example,
create a TEST.CMD file with the following text:

   @echo off

   return 3
   if errorlevel 3 set x=3
   if errorlevel 2 set x=2
   if errorlevel 1 set x=1
   echo Return is: %X%

   return 3
   if errorlevel 1 set x=1
   if errorlevel 2 set x=2
   if errorlevel 3 set x=3
   echo Return is: %X%

NOTE: RETURN.EXE is just a simple program which performs exit(atoi(argv[1])).

If you run TEST.CMD in OS/2 1.3 and Windows NT 3.5, the following results
appear:

   Return is: 3
   Return is: 1

If you run TEST.CMD in Windows NT 3.51, the following results appear:

   Return is: 1
   Return is: 3
