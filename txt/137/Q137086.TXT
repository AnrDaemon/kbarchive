TITLE   :No Output: Right-Hand ALT Key with UK Keyboard Layout
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you select the United Kingdom (UK) keyboard Layout from Control Panel
International, the right-hand ALT key (also known as the AltGr Key) will not
work as expected. By selecting the UK keyboard layout you should be able to hold
down the right-hand ALT key and select any vowel (a, e, i, o, and u) and the
accent character (') should appear over the vowel you selected. For example,
when you press Right ALT+A, [ASCII 225] should appear. Instead, no output
appears.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
