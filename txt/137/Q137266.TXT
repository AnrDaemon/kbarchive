-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you reinstall Microsoft Plus!, you may receive one of the following error
messages:

   Setup could not open the file <file name>.

   Insert the disk labeled 'Microsoft Plus! CD-ROM' into drive A: Some disks may
   not be required for the selected installation options.

   Object 2157

   Your Setup files may be damaged. Try restarting the Setup program.

   NOTE: This error message may be repeated many times before you can quit the
   Setup program.

   Custom Action Error. The system cannot find the file specified.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages can occur for any of the following reasons:

 - If you originally installed Microsoft Plus! from a CD-ROM and you later try
   to install the floppy disk version.

 - If you originally installed Microsoft Plus! from floppy disks and you later
   try to install the CD-ROM version.

 - If the path for the Microsoft Plus! files (as specified in the Setup.stf
   file) is incorrect. You may experience this behavior if the drive letter for
   a CD-ROM drive has changed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the issue and install Microsoft Plus!, use one of the following
methods:

 - Uninstall Microsoft Plus! and then reinstall it using the new media type
   (floppy disks or CD-ROM).

 - Rename the Setup.stf file in the Program Files\Plus!\Setup folder to
   Setup.old, and then run Microsoft Plus! Setup again.

 - Edit the Setup.stf file to reflect the correct path to the Microsoft Plus!
   source files and then run Setup again. To do so, follow these steps:

   1. Use any text editor, such as WordPad, to open the Setup.stf file in the
      Program Files\Plus!\Setup folder.

      NOTE: If you installed Microsoft Plus! in a folder other than the Program
      Files\Plus! folder, open the Setup.stf file in the Setup folder in the
      folder in which you installed Microsoft Plus!.

   2. Change the "Source Directory" line to reflect the current path to the
      Microsoft Plus! source files.

      NOTE: If you inadvertently remove any spaces from the end of the path in
      the "Source Directory" line, you receive the following error message when
      you run Microsoft Plus! Setup in Maintenance mode:

   Setup Error 946

   Check Modules Object

   Your Setup files may be damaged. Try restarting the Setup program.

      If this occurs, rename or delete the Setup.stf file and run Setup again
      from the Microsoft Plus! disks or CD-ROM.

   3. Save the Setup.stf file and then quit the editor.

   4. Run Microsoft Plus! Setup.
