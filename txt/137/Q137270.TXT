KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A CD-ROM drive connected to a Media Vision 3D sound card with an NCR 406A SCSI
chip set is not detected by Setup.

CAUSE
=====

Although Windows 95 includes a driver for the Media Vision 3D sound card, it
does not include a protected-mode driver for the NCR 406A chip set SCSI
interface on the sound card.

RESOLUTION
==========

Load the real-mode drivers for the CD-ROM drive, including the Mini406a.sys
driver for the SCSI interface. For information about loading the real-mode
drivers, please consult the CD-ROM drive's documentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can continue to use the Windows 95 protected-mode drivers for the sound card
while you are using the real-mode drivers for the CD-ROM drive.
