TITLE   :PPT7: Preview Not Available for PowerPoint 4.0 Template
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbdta

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to apply a PowerPoint 4.0 Presentation Template in PowerPoint
for Windows 95, version 7.0, you may see the "Preview Not Available" message in
the Preview area of the Apply Design Template dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

PowerPoint 7.0 saves a Device Independent Bitmap (DIB) image of the first slide
in your presentation as a preview image. In contrast, PowerPoint 4.0 uses a
Windows Metafile (WMF) image of slide one as the preview image. This behavior
occurs with templates that shipped with PowerPoint 4.0. It does not occur with
templates that you create in PowerPoint 4.0
