TITLE   :PC Forms: MEFROUTE.XLA Will Not Route Excel 5 Workbooks
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Excel macro, MEFROUTE.XLA, included with Microsoft Electronic
Forms Designer, will not allow you to route workbooks from Microsoft Excel
version 5.0 or later. The workbook is sent successfully, but the recipient
receives the following error when he or she tries to open the attachment:

   The attached file [BOOK1.XLS]Sheet1 could not be opened because a temporary
   file could not be created."

CAUSE
=====

The MEFROUTE.XLA shipped with Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer was written
for Microsoft Excel versions 3.0 and 4.0. Because of changes in the way
Microsoft Excel version 5.0 and later use workbooks with sheet tabs, the routing
macro needs to be edited to route workbooks successfully.
