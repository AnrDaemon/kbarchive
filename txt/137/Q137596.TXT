TITLE   :PPT7: Can't Print Multiple Copies to HP DeskJet Printer
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0, when you attempt to print more than
one copy at a time, and if you are printing to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet
500C, 540C, 550C or 560C, only a single copy is printed (rather than the
multiple copies you specified).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a limitation in the HP DeskJet printer driver, which
does not support multiple copy printing in PowerPoint for Windows 95 version
7.0.


RESOLUTION
==========

To print multiple copies to the HP DeskJet 550C or 560C, you must click the
Print command for every print job desired.

To work around this problem, enter the entire slide range into the Slides portion
of the print dialog box. For example, if you wanted three copies of slides 1
through 4, you would type the following in the Slides portion of the Print Range
section in the Print dialog box:

   1-4,1-4,1-4
