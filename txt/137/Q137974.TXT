SUMMARY
=======

To set up roving user profiles using the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory
Services (NDS), you must set up home directories with full permissions for each
user.

You can use Nwadmin.exe or Netadmin.exe to edit the properties for each user so
that there is a home directory set under Environment. For example:

   Volume:testserver_sys.company
   Path:home\username

When you are using only the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks, profiles are
typically saved in the Mail directory. Mail directories are not available with
Novell NetWare 4.x (unless they are left from a previous version of NetWare).
Therefore, the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (NDS) uses the
home directory instead.
