The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To support automatic startup of Windows NT programs, the TPSTART program
included with SNA Server must be running. This is documented in Appendix B of
the SNA Server APPC Programmer's Guide and Appendix A of the SNA Server CPIC
Programmer's Guide.

Automatic startup of invokable transaction programs:

 - that are written as Windows NT programs is supported by:
    - SNA Server 2.1

    - SNA Server 2.11

    - SNA Server 3.0

    - SNA Server 4.0

 - that are written as Windows NT services is supported by:
    - SNA Server 2.0

    - SNA Server 2.1

    - SNA Server 2.11

    - SNA Server 3.0

    - SNA Server 4.0

The More Information section of this article describes undocumented parameters of
the TPSTART program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The TPSTART program supports the following command line options that are not
documented:


/QSIZE=<number>

   Replace <number> with the number of dynamic load requests that can be
   queued by the TPSTART program. MIN = 16; MAX = 256; DEFAULT = 64.

/HIDE

   This parameter causes the TPSTART icon, which usually appears during startup,
   to be hidden.

The following options can be used to control internal tracing within the TPSTART
program:

/TRACE

   This parameter enables internal tracing. The default is no tracing.

/FILE=<filename>

   Replace <filename> with the path to and name of the trace file that
   should log the traces. By default, tracing is disabled, so you must specify a
   trace file if you use the /TRACE option.

/FSIZE=<size>

   Replace <size> with the number that is the maximum size in bytes that
   you want the TPSTART internal trace file to grow to. MIN=10000;
   MAX=0xFFFFFFFF; DEFAULT=500K. When the trace file grows to the maximum size,
   it is renamed to <filename>.BAK.

/LEVEL=<tracelevel>

   Replace <tracelevel> with a number between 0 and 10. Smaller numbers
   mean more detailed internal tracing. For example, 0 indicates maximum detail
   collection, which is the recommended setting to use if you need internal
   tracing. The default of 10 turns off tracing.

For example, to get full internal tracing, start the TPSTART program with the
following command line options:

   "tpstart /trace /file=c:\sna\traces\tpstart.trc /level=0" (without the
   quotation marks)

To turn off internal tracing and unlock the internal trace file, quit TPSTART.
