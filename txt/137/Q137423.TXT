======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) database is missing an entry
from a particular workstation or server service, you can stop and restart
the particular service(s) to reregister the individual entries into WINS
without having to restart the computer.

The following table shows in the right column which names are registered
in the WINS database and which service identifiers (hexadecimal numbers)
are appended to those names by the service when you start the
corresponding service in the left column:

Service                   Reregisters
-------------------------------------------------------------
Browser Service           <domain_name>\<workgroup_name><1Eh>

Messenger Service         <computer_name><03h>
                          <computer_name><01h>

Netlogon Service PDC      <domain_name><1Bh>
                 PDC      <domain_name><1Ch>

Workstation Service       <domain_name>\<workgroup><00h>
                          <computer_name><00h>
                          <domain_name><1Ch>

Server Service            <computer_name><20h>

NOTE: If the Server Service is stopped, you will be unable to access the
computer from the network to start it again. Stop and start the Server
Service at the console.
