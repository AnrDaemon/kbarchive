SUMMARY
=======

To disable the resizing of an OLE Control, you need to override the
COleControl::OnNcLButtonDown() and COleControl::OnSetExtent() functions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default implementation of COleControl::OnNcLButtonDown() initiates the
tracker rectangle and changes the extent of the control based on the results.

The default implementation of COleControl::OnSetExtent() is called by the
framework to change the size of the control based, at least in part, on the
sizing handled by the client container.

To disable resizing, you need to disable the tracker rectangle supported by
COleControl::OnNcLButtonDown() and ignore any size changes sent to
COleControl::OnSetExtent().

To disable resizing in the Circle3 tutorial, override CCirc3Ctrl::OnSetExtent()
and CCirc3Ctrl::OnNcLButtonDown() and implement as follows:

   BOOL CCirc3Ctrl::OnSetExtent(LPSIZEL lpSizeL)
   {
      return FALSE;
   }

   void CCirc3Ctrl::OnNcLButtonDown(UINT nHitTest, CPoint point)
   {
      return;
   }
