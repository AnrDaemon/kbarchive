The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Publisher for Windows 95, version 3.0 on CD-ROM 
 - Microsoft Publisher for Windows, versions 2.0 on CD-ROM, 2.0a on CD-ROM 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Publisher or Office from compact disc under Windows 95, you may
receive one of several error messages similar to:

   D:\ is not accessible.

   The device is not ready.

You can also receive these error messages accessing clip art on compact disc or
playing Media Clips from compact disc.

CAUSE
=====

These problems can occur if Windows 95 Setup did not correctly identify which
CD-ROM drive you have. If Windows 95 can't identify your CD-ROM drive, it will
optimize the access pattern for a quadruple-speed drive. If you do not have a
quadruple-speed drive, you can get a variety of errors trying to install or run
programs from a compact disc.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Using the right mouse button, click the My Computer icon and then click
   Properties.

2. Click the Performance tab and click File System.

3. Click the CD-ROM tab.

4. Choose the entry from the Optimize Access Pattern For list that most closely
   matches your CD-ROM drive. The available choices are:

   No read-ahead
   Single-speed drives
   Double-speed drives
   Triple-speed drives
   Quad-speed or higher

5. Click OK.

6. Restart Windows 95.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
