======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a Microsoft Exchange message with an attachment, the message is
printed to the specified printer, but the attachment may be printed to the
Windows 95 default printer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs only if the following conditions are met:

 - You have two printer drivers installed on the same computer, and each driver
   is configured to print to a different location.

 - You print the message with the attachment in the following manner:

   1. You click the mail message containing the attachment, and then click Print
      on the File menu.

   2. You click the Print Attachments check box to select it.

   3. In the Printer Name box, you click a printer other than the default
      printer.

   4. You click OK.

Microsoft Exchange prints the message to the printer you specified, but the
program associated with the attachment is responsible for printing the
attachment. In this case, the program associated with the attachment prints the
attachment to the default printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this situation, use either of the following methods:

 - Before you print the message, set the printer to which you want to print the
   message as the default printer. To do so, follow these steps:

   1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

   2. Use the right mouse button to click the printer you want to set as the
      default printer, and then click Set As Default on the menu that appears.

 - Open the mail message, double-click the attachment to start its associated
   program, and then print the attachment to the printer you specify in the
   associated program.
