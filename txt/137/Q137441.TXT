SUMMARY
=======

The UIEnable event does not occur for the Column, Custom, Form, Header,
OptionButton, Page, _SCREEN, Timer, and ToolBar objects.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the UIEnable event to specify user interface actions that should
occur for an object or control when the Page control that contains it is
activated or deactivated. There are three reasons a class of object does not
contain this event:

 - The class of object depends on its container object. This is the case with
   Column, Header, OptionButton, and Page controls, which are dependent,
   respectively, on the Grid, Column, OptionGroup, and PageFrame controls. The
   UIEnable event goes to the container for these objects.

 - The class of object has no user interface. This is the case with the Custom
   and Timer objects. They have no user interface, so they do not receive
   UIEnable event notification.

 - The class of object can not be contained within a page. This is the case with
   Form, _SCREEN, and Toolbar objects.
