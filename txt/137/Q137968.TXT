TITLE   :Perfmon and Network Monitor Counters Show Incorrect Values
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Under heavy stress situations, Windows NT computers running Network Monitor or
Performance Monitor on a Token Ring 16Mb network with a NetFlx Eth/TR II network
interface card (NIC) return zero for the following performance counters:

Perfmon Network Segment Object:

   % Broadcast frames
   % Multicast Frames
   % Network utilization
   Broadcast frames received/second
   Multicast frames received/second
   Total bytes received/second

Network General

   % Broadcast frames
   % Multicast Frames
   % Network utilization
   Broadcast frames received/second
   Multicast frames received/second
   Total bytes received/second

This typically occurs when network utilization is continuously greater than 70-80
percent.

NOTE: The Performance counters do appear after a short period of time to recover
as the values start to again increment but they never fully recover in that the
values appear extremely low.

CAUSE
=====

The NetFlex II NIC stops responding (hangs) and the counters are reset to 0.


RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. Windows NT now polls the NIC every 2 seconds to check for a hung
condition. If hung, it is reset, but not into promiscuous mode. This problem
does not happen when the NIC is running in normal mode.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
