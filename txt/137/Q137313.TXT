TITLE   :Err Msg: Microsoft Backup Could Not Create an Image List...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Microsoft Backup to perform a large number of backup, restore, or
compare operations, either all at once or over a long period of time, the
following error message may be displayed if you do not close Backup
periodically:

   Microsoft Backup could not create an image list. Quit Backup and all other
   running programs, restart Backup, and then try again.

CAUSE
=====

Backup uses various system resources each time it performs a particular
operation. These resources may not be returned to the system when the operation
is complete, and therefore may accumulate as subsequent operations are
performed. When a large number of operations have been performed, Windows 95 may
be unable to allocate additional resources to Backup, causing the above error
message to be displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you receive the error message stated above, quit and then restart Backup, and
then resume your backup, restore, or compare operations. If this does not
eliminate the problem, restart your computer, start Backup, and then resume the
operations.


To prevent this error message from appearing, quit and restart Backup
periodically when you are performing a large number of operations.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
