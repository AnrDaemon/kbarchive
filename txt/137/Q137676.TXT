The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you receive a message from a user on another Microsoft Mail postoffice, you
might notice the date and/or time stamp on the Inbox header is incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

The date and/or time of the machine running EXTERNAL.EXE that last handled the
message is not current.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure the system date and time is current on all machines running the
External mail processes. Set the time and date either using the MS-DOS TIME and
DATE commands, or change it in the CMOS of the machine.

NOTE: The MS-DOS TIME and DATE commands may not change the CMOS setting
information on some systems. For these machines, the system date and time may
revert to the previous setting on restart.
