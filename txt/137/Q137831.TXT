SUMMARY
=======

If you add objects (logos, specific text, and so on) to your default PowerPoint
template, the objects appear only in new presentations that you create based on
this template. If you create a presentation based on a different template, those
objects are not created automatically.

There are five methods you can use to create a new PowerPoint presentation. Only
two of them automatically use the default template.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PowerPoint Startup dialog box gives you three choices for a new
presentation:

 - AutoContent Wizard

 - Use A Template

 - Blank Presentation

Of these three choices, only the Blank Presentation choice uses the default
template.

You can also create a new presentation by clicking New on the File menu. When you
do this, you can choose the template you want for the new presentation; Blank
Presentation is not selected automatically. In contrast, if you click the New
button on the Standard Toolbar, your presentation will be based on Blank
Presentation.

A presentation created using a presentation template other than Blank
Presentation won't contain user-added items (unless you added the items to that
template file).
