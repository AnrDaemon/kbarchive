TITLE   :Edit Login Script Option for FPNW Not Available
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When an administrator creates a new user and enables that user for NetWare
compatible login by selecting Maintain NetWare Login, then selects the NWCompat
button to modify the user's NetWare compatible properties, the Edit Login
Script... button is grayed. Also, no information is displayed in the Object ID
field.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An Object ID for a new user is not been generated until that user is added by
pressing the Add button on the New User dialog. Therefore, the user's Object ID
is not displayed when viewing the NetWare Compatible Properties. The Login
Script for that user cannot yet be edited because a directory for the Login
Script has not been created on the user's behalf in the
SYS:MAIL\<ObjectID> directory. Once the user has been added, the Login
Script may be edited from User Manager by double-clicking on the user's name,
selecting the NWCompat button, then selecting the Edit Login Script... button.

Additional query words: fpnw
