TITLE   :Windows 95 Client Can Browse NetWare 2.x Without Permission
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you browse NetWare version 2.x servers using the Microsoft Client for
NetWare networks, you may be able to view folders and files that you do not have
permission to view. If you try to run or open such a file or folder, you receive
one of the following error messages:

 - Windows can't find <executable>

 - Access denied

CAUSE
=====

The Novell NetWare NETX and VLM redirectors cannot view files for which the
client does not have access permissions. However, because the Microsoft Client
for NetWare Networks is a graphical network client, it allows you to browse
NetWare resources.

For example, with the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks installed, you may be
able to view shared folders that you do not have permissions for and to view a
list of the files that those folders contain. However, if you try to run, open,
or manipulate any of these files or folders, you receive an error messages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
