SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT Server or Workstation, the following error appears
during the text mode portion of Setup:

   UNABLE TO READ
   Error 52225 line 1933
   D:\winnt\private\ntos\boot\setup\setup.c

   Press any key to continue

   -or -

The error during Windows NT V4.0 setup is as follows:

Unexpected error (256) occurred at
Line 2180 in d:\nt\private\ntos\boot\setup\setup.c

Setup cannot configure your computer to start windows NT. This may indicate a
problem with the hard disk containing your C: drive or C: may be severely
corrupt. Setup cannot continue.

Press F3 to exit.

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs because Setup cannot write the disk signature. Some computers
have a BIOS option to enable protection of the master boot record (MBR) and/or
boot sector. If this option is turned on, Setup is not able to write the disk
signature or create/delete partitions during Setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable the CMOS option to protect the MBR and boot sector.
