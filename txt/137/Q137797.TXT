SYMPTOMS
========


When you run Systems Management Server on a computer running Windows 3.1 and
NetWare 3.12, you do not receive any jobs in Package Command Manager. Although
Package Command Manager is unable to connect to the NetWare server, you can make
connections to the server manually. Manual connections to NetWare server
applications share work fine. The SYSTEM.INI file has the correct
NETWORK.DRV=NETWARE.DRV mapping. When you run Package Command Manager with the
/DEBUG option, the following two errors appear while PCM is activating:

   Error connecting to current logon server:
   Error connecting to server:

This problem does not occur when you use Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and NetWare
3.12.

CAUSE
=====


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
