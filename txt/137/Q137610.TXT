TITLE   :SMS: Senders Do Not Check for Sufficient Disk Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smssenders kbSMSSender

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server senders do not check for free disk space before
sending a package. As a result, if the destination site does not have a
sufficient amount of space to store the package, the job is retried and
eventually fails. If you are using the LAN sender, Win32 error 112 is logged in
the Lansend.log file with the following text:

   There is not enough space on the disk.

If you are using the SNA Batch sender, an entry similar to the following is
logged in the Snabatch.log file:

   ~Attempt to write 65523 bytes to 1_06XCEN.PCK
   ~Wrote 65523 bytes to 1_06XCEN.PCK
   ~Attempt to write 65523 bytes to 1_06XCEN.PCK
   ~Closing remote file
   Error, trying to write beyond the end of the file.~
   ~Deleting remote file 1_06XCEN.PCK
   ~We have 0 active connections

Other senders will have similar errors.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, ensure that the destination site has enough space
for the package. When determining how much disk space is needed for a package,
take into account the amount of space required for the despooler to decompress
the package after the sender has completed sending. If the job is presently in a
retrying state, it should complete when sufficient space is made available. If
the job has failed, delete it and create a new job.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.
