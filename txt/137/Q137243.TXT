TITLE   :Cannot Print Multiple Copies from WordPad or Paint
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from WordPad or Paint, the Number Of Copies option may be
unavailable, preventing you from printing multiple copies of the current
document.

CAUSE
=====

The printer that you are using does not support printing multiple copies.
WordPad and Paint do not provide functionality for printing multiple copies;
they rely on the printer driver to provide this functionality.

If you use a printer driver that supports printing multiple copies, this
functionality is available in WordPad and Paint.

RESOLUTION
==========

To print multiple copies of a document, print each copy individually. To bypass
the Print dialog box that appears each time you print a document, use the Print
button on the toolbar rather than the Print command on the File menu.
