======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows 95, you may receive the following error message:

   Cannot find a device file that may be needed to run Windows or a Windows
   application.

   The Windows registry or System.ini file refers to this device file, but the
   device file no longer exists.

   If you deleted this file on purpose, try uninstalling the associated
   application using its uninstall program or setup program.

   If you still want to use the application associated with this device file, try
   reinstalling that application to replace the missing file.

   Vnetsup.vxd

   -or-

   Dfs.vxd

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you remove the Microsoft Network components in Network
properties. When you do so, a reference to the Vnetsup.vxd or Dfs.vxd file is
not removed from the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Use Registry Editor to delete the StaticVxD value in the Vnetsup subkey under
   the following registry entry:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlset\Services\VxD\vnetsup

   -or-

   Use Registry Editor to delete the StaticVxD value in the DFS subkey under the
   following registry entry:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlset\Services\VxD\dfs

 - Install and remove network components. To do so, follow these steps:

   1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

   2. Click Add, click Adapter, and then click Add.

   3. In the Manufacturers box, click Detected Network Driver. In the Network
      Adapters box, click Existing NDIS2 Driver, and then click OK.

   4. If you have not entered a workgroup name and a computer name previously,
      you are prompted to do so. If you are prompted, fill in the appropriate
      fields on the Identification tab.

   5. Click OK or Close until you return to Control Panel. When you are prompted
      to restart your computer, do so.

   6. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

   7. Click the network adapter, and then click Remove.

   8. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.
