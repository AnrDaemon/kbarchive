Applications designed for Windows automatically take advantage of many new
Microsoft Windows 95 features. Some of these new features cause side effects
that could not have been anticipated by vendors who shipped FoxPro 2.6 for
Windows applications a year or even six months before Windows 95 was released.

The "Running FoxPro 2.6 for Windows Applications Under Windows 95" document
discusses the following changes that developers contacting Microsoft Technical
Support have asked about:

 - The FoxPro Icon is displayed in the Explorer for a distributed application.
 - The FoxPro 2.6 Icon is displayed in the Title Bar and Task Bar.
 - The FoxPro 2.6 Icon is displayed periodically in a screen's Title Bar.
 - The Close menu does not work.
 - Screens with a bordertype of System, Panel, or Double cannot be restored
   after being minimized.
