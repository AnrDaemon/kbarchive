TITLE   :Changing Modem for DUN Connectoid Restores Default Settings
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:dun win95 kbDialUp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the modem that a Dial-Up Networking connectoid is configured to
use, the settings for that connectoid return to their default values. These
settings include modem-specific settings such as speaker volume and maximum
speed, and also include settings such as the type of Dial-Up server you are
connecting to and the TCP/IP settings to use (if you use TCP/IP). If you change
back to the modem the connectoid was originally configured to use, the settings
are not restored.

CAUSE
=====

In a Dial-Up Networking connectoid, all settings except the phone number are
associated with a specific modem. If you change the modem a connectoid is
configured to use, the settings are returned to their default values.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - If you need to use two different modems with a Dial-Up Networking connectoid,
   create two connectoids, each of which is configured to use one of the modems.

 - Install the Dial-Up Networking 1.3 Upgrade. For information about the Dial-Up
   Networking 1.3 Upgrade, please see the following article in the Microsoft
