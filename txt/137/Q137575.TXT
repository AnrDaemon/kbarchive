SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Microsoft IntelliPoint version 1.1 software, you may be
unable to toggle the status of the NUMLOCK key.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this problem, add a key named "Keyboard" to the following registry
key:

   
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Microsoft Input Devices

Add a string value named "NumLock" to the key, and set the string value to "ON"
(or to "OFF," if you want the NUMLOCK key to be off by default).

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

For information about backing up the registry, please see the following article
