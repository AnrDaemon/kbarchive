TITLE   :Quick View Does Not Show Area Graph in Microsoft Excel
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to view a Microsoft Excel file that contains a chart with multiple
data series, Quick View does not show multiple chart types reliably. Instead,
Quick View either converts all the series to one type of chart, or shows the
data in the correct type of chart, but the chart varies significantly from the
actual graph.

For example, if you create a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that contains two data
series, and you then create a chart in which one series is represented by bars
and the other series by an area graph, Quick View shows both series with bars.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
