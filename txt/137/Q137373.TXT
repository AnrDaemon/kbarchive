TITLE   :Using UINFO.XNF in MIF Entry Results in Corrupted File Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you run MIF Entry (MIFWIN.EXE) on the client computer and use a completely
revised form (UINFO.XNF) modified on the Systems Management Server compared with
the original UINFO.XNF, the following error message appears:

   The form template file is corrupted.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, rename or delete the UINFO.SEV file located in the
\MS\SMS\NOIDMIFS directory on the client computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The UINFO.XNF file is the default form used when you run MIFWIN on the client
computer. Once you enter the prompted information and save the form, UINFO.SEV
and UINFO.MIF are created and saved in the \MS\SMS\NOIDMIFS directory on the
client computer. Once the Systems Management Server sends a package containing a
new UINFO.XNF file to the client computers and you run MIFWIN, MIFWIN checks the
entry contents of the new UINFO.XNF and UINFO.SEV.
