TITLE   :Custom Forms Do Not Function Correctly with Quickbooks 3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The check printing feature of Quickbooks 3 for Windows does not print correctly
on custom forms under Windows NT 3.5. When you try to print multiple checks it
sends a form feed that causes the paper to advance past the custom forms
printable areas. Quicken 3 for Windows only recognizes and uses the 8 1/2 x 11
inch form.

CAUSE
=====

If you define a custom form, you then need to set this form as the job default.
But the default form setting is not being used or is being reset to 8 1/2 x 11.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is still under investigation. The problem does not occur if you
print reports with Quicken 3. Quicken 3 will not return any errors when the
problem does occur.
