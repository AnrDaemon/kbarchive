TITLE   :PPT7: Color Mapping Errors Between Windows 95 and NT 3.51
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Slides may appear to be blank if a PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0,
presentation created in Windows 95 with a display setting of 16 colors is opened
in PowerPoint 7.0 running on Windows NT 3.51. If you select the Title or Body
text areas, all that is revealed is the text and slide background in the text
box areas. The remainder of the slide still appears to be blank.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the computer running Windows NT 3.51 uses the Cirrus
Logic 16-color display driver.


RESOLUTION
==========

Change the Windows NT 3.51 display driver to 256 colors or higher.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue appears to apply only to the Cirrus Logic display drivers supplied
with Windows 95 and NT 3.51, and only in the 16-color display mode. A PowerPoint
7.0 presentation created under Windows NT 3.51 with a 16-color display setting
does not exhibit this behavior running under Windows 95.
