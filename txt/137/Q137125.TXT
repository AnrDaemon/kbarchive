SUMMARY
=======

The IncrementalSearch property of list and combo boxes permit the user to
perform an incremental search of values. An example of an incremental search
would be to type the letter F followed by the letter O, and find the first
occurrence of a string beginning with FO. A non-incremental search in this case
would first locate the first string beginning with F, followed by the first
string beginning with the letter O.

The IncrementalSearch property enables or disables this capability within list
and combo boxes. However, by itself, the IncremetalSearch property set to True
may not always produce what you expect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To take advantage of the IncrementalSearch property, the _DBLCLICK variable must
also be set. The initial value of .5 for _DBLCLICK may not provide adequate time
to enter the characters in the object. Increasing the value of _DBLCLICK to 1.5
allows more time to enter data.

Therefore, in the Init event of a formset, form, list box, or combo box, add this
line of code:

      _DBLCLICK=1.5

Then set the IncrementalSearch property of the list or combo box to true, and the
incremental search behavior will work as expected.
