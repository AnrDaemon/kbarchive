TITLE   :NetWare Clients Not Receiving Shared Network Distribution
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork kbusage kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


A NetWare client computer running VLM that logs on to a NetWare 4.x server may
not be able to receive any shared network applications, program groups or icons
distributed by Systems Management Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, log in to the NetWare 4.x server in bindery emulation
mode using the following syntax:

   login <servername>/<username> /B

If you do not use the /B parameter, you are logging into the NetWare server using
NetWare Directory Services (NDS) context structure.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
