======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a program that uses only a joystick for input, System Agent may
minimize the program and start a scheduled task.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the joystick is connected to a game port, and
game ports are not interrupt-driven. System Agent cannot easily poll game ports
to determine if they are in use.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this issue from occurring, disable System Agent before you run a
program that uses only a joystick for input.

To disable System Agent, right-click the System Agent icon on the taskbar, and
then click Suspend System Agent.

When you are finished, you can enable System Agent by repeating the steps you
used to disable it.
