TITLE   :BUG: Number of Lines on First Page of Listing File Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.0x,6.11x,6.1x
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0x, 6.1x, 6.11x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the PAGE directive to specify the number of lines per page of the
listing file, the first listing page contains more lines than specified by the
PAGE directive.

CAUSE
=====

The problem apparently occurs because the internal counter used to track the
number of lines per page does not include the four-line header on the first page
or any comments that start on the first line of the source file. However, it
does count the header on subsequent pages. As a result, all pages have the
correct number of lines except for the first page, which contains additional
lines.


RESOLUTION
==========

If reducing the number of lines per page to account for the first page is not an
option, the PAGE directive used without an argument can be placed in the source
file at or near the correct position. This will force a page break on the first
page. Some experimentation will be necessary, and the position of the forced
page break will have to be adjusted if the source above the forced page break
changes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
