SUMMARY
=======

After you install the DLC protocol in Control Panel Networks, the Hewlett-
Packard Network Port option may not appear as one of the Available Print
Monitors. If you remove and re-install the DLC protocol and the Hewlett- Packard
Network Port option is still not available, a network adapter setting may be
incorrect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can change the network adapter settings through the registry, provided only
one network adapter is installed on the print device.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors
   \Hewlett-Packard Network Port\Options

3. Select Adapter.

4. From the Edit menu, select DWORD.

5. Change the value to 0 and choose OK.

6. Quit Registry Editor.

7. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.
