TITLE   :The Control Point Name is Invalid

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft SNA Server version 2.11 on a Microsoft Windows NT
server, the following error message appears when you run SNA Admin:

   Error 3846:
   The Control Point Name is invalid.
   The name can be from one through eight alphanumeric characters long.

This problem occurs when the Windows NT server name begins with a digit.

CAUSE
=====

There is an IBM SNA standard that an APPC control point name cannot begin with a
digit. If the Local Control Point Name is not already configured on the SNA
Server, the Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 Admin program automatically sets the Local
Control Point Name (in the server properties dialog) to the Windows NT
computername. If the Windows NT computername starts with a digit, the SNA Admin
program sets the local control point name to an invalid value.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, open the COM.CFG file with the command line
command:

   "SNAADMIN C:\SNA\SYSTEM\CONFIG\COM.CFG" (without the quotation marks)

This opens the SNA Server configuration file off-line and allows you to make
changes the configuration.

If the "Servers and Connections" window in SNA Server Admin lists the SNA Server
Name, double-click on the SNA Server Name and enter a valid Control Point Name.

If the Servers and Connections window has only "No Assigned Services" listed, use
the following process to add a SNA Server with a valid Control Point Name:

1. Select Services from the SNA Server Admin Menu Bar.

2. Select New Server from the Services drop down menu.

3. Enter the NT Computer Name in the Server Name field on the Server Properties
   dialog.

4. Enter a valid Control Point Name in the Control Point Name field. If you
   enter a Control Point, you must also enter a Network Name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
