TITLE   :How to Obtain the Active Drive Letters in a Visual FoxPro App
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Call the GetLogicalDriveStrings API to get all the drive letters used in the
active session of Windows NT or Windows 95. This API is not supported in Win32s,
so it cannot be used when Visual FoxPro is running under Windows 3.x.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code fragment returns an array called aMyarray containing all the
used drive letters for that session of Windows NT or Windows 95. The code uses
the GetLogicalDriveStrings Windows API, which is supported under Win32 only, not
Win32s. The Number of drives is in a variables called NumberOfDrives.

      DECLARE INTEGER GetLogicalDriveStrings IN Win32API as getit;
          INTEGER nBuffSize, STRING  lpString
      CLEAR
      DIMENSION aMyarray(1)
      lpString=SPACE(200)
      nBuffSize=LEN(lpString)
      =getit(nBuffSize,@lpString)
      NumberOfDrives=OCCURS(":",lpString)
      DIMENSION aMyarray(NumberOfDrives)
      FOR  i=1 TO  NumberOfDrives
         aMyarray(i)=SUBSTR(lpString,AT(":",lpString,i)-1,1)
      ENDFOR
