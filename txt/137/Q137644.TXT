SYMPTOMS

When you try to start the 32-bit version of the PVCS Version Manager 5.2
development management platform by Intersolv, you may receive an "invalid page
fault" error message.

CAUSE
=====

When you are installing PVCS Version Manager 5.2, a User ID prompt should
appear. However, this prompt may not appear when you are installing the program
in Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

For information about configuring the User ID for PVCS Version Manager 5.2,
please consult the program's documentation or manufacturer.


MORE INFORMATION
================

There are both 16-bit and 32-bit versions of PVCS Version Manager. The 16-bit
version should run without problems in Windows 95.

NOTE: When you are prompted to install the Win32s dynamic-link libraries (DLLs)
during PVCS Version Manager Setup, click No. Installing these files causes some
Windows 95 DLLs to be overwritten, which can cause problems.
