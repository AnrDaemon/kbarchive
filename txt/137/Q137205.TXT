The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0 user sends a recurring meeting
request to a Schedule+ version 1.0 user, the appointment is booked as a
single appointment.

This is by product design. Schedule+ 1.0 does not allow users to invite
others to a recurring meeting.


Additional query words: 7.00 schedule plus scheduleplus
