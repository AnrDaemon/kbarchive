TITLE   :XADM: Controlling Intra-Site Replication

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Controlling intra-site replication can be done by setting two registry entries
on each Microsoft Exchange Server. They are Pause After Modify and Pause Between
DSAs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Pause After Modify (defaults to 300 seconds) specifies how long the Directory
service delays before notifying other Microsoft Exchange Servers in the Site
that a change has occurred. This is useful when the administrator makes many
changes because each change does not cause the Directory to push out
notification, it waits until the pause time has expired.

Pause Between DSAs (defaults to 30 seconds) is the amount of time that a
Microsoft Exchange Server with a change waits between the notification of each
other server in the Site. For example: If there are four servers in the Site and
a change is made on Server 1, Server 1 waits until the Pause After Modify time
has expired before notifying Server 2. Server 1 then waits for Pause Between
DSAs seconds and then notifies Server 1. Server 1 again waits for Pause Between
DSAs seconds and then notify Server 4.

The registry entries are located in:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS
                    \Parameters
                               \Replicator notify pause after modify (secs)
                               \Replicator notify pause between DSAs (secs)
