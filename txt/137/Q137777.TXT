put the name of the memo field in the left pane, but the contents do not appear
in the right pane.

RESOLUTION
==========

To see the text of a memo field, enter either of the following expressions in
the left pane of the debug window:

      <tablename>.<memofldname> + ""

   -or-

      MLINE(<tablename>.<memofldname>,1)

STATUS

This behavior is by design.
