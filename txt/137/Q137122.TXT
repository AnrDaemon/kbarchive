Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Create and run a program containing this code:

      * Start of program
      *
      * This program assumes the existence of the file 'autoexec.bat' in the
      * c:\ directory.
      * Example - does not find file

      SET DEFAULT TO c:\temp   && This directory must exist
      SET PATH TO c:\ 
      nhand=FOPEN('autoexec.bat')   && Returns -1  -  FOPEN failed
      ?STR(nhand)+ " In SET PATH"

      * The following command returns 2 for "File not found"
      ?STR(FERROR()) + " FERROR Code"
      =FCLOSE(nhand)

      * Workaround 1 - finds file

      SET DEFAULT TO c:\ 
      nhand2=FOPEN('autoexec.bat')  && FOPEN succeeds in default directory
      ?STR(nhand2) + " In SET DEFAULT"
      =FCLOSE(nhand2)

      * Workaround 2 - finds file

      SET DEFAULT TO c:\temp   && This directory must exist
      nhand3=FOPEN('c:\autoexec.bat')   && FOPEN succeeds with path passed
      ?STR(nhand3) + " Path explicitly passed to FOPEN"
      =FCLOSE(nhand3)

         * End of program
