The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run 16-bit Windows applications in Windows NT, you may experience
problems using OLE automation or embedding. When you click on an embedded
object, the following error message may appear:

   Unable to launch PROGRAM.EXE

CAUSE
=====

One possible explanation of these errors is that the OLE registration for the
server application was entered using Long File Names.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To correct this, replace the LFN path to the executable with an 8.3
representation.

1. Use REGEDT32.EXE to edit the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT

2. Find the OLE registration entries for your specific application.
   Eg. Access.Application.7->shell->open->command

3. Double click on the Command entry and edit the path to use 8.3 syntax instead
   of an LFN.
   From: c:\Program Files\Office\MSACCESS.EXE /NOSTARTUP "%1"
   To: c:\progra~1\office\MSACCESS.EXE /NOSTARTUP "%1"
