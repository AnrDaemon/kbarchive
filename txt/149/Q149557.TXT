======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you start the AT Scheduler with an account other than the default system
account, 16-bit Windows applications do not run when scheduled.

CAUSE
=====

You can schedule a 16-bit Windows application to start interactively if you
start the AT scheduler with the default system account.

If you do not start the Windows on Windows (WOW) subsystem interactively,
requests for required resources by the 16-bit Windows application are not
granted and the application does not start.

RESOLUTION
==========

To get the application to run under the Scheduler service you must reconfigure
the Scheduler service to run using the system user account and specify that the
application is to be run interactively.
