TITLE   :XCLN: Multiple Providers Not Available with the MS-DOS Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange client for MS-DOS does not have the ability to use
multiple Service Providers. It is hard coded to use just the Microsoft Exchange
Server provider.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design. The MS-DOS client does not use the "driver" architecture used
by the Microsoft Exchange clients for Microsoft Windows 3.x, Windows 95, and
Windows NT.
