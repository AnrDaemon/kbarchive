TITLE   :PRB: F1 Key Does Not CLEAR READ in Visual FoxPro for Windows
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a READ command is in effect in FoxPro 2.x for Windows or FoxPro 2.x for
MS-DOS at the time the F1 key is pressed, the READ command clears. Otherwise, by
default, pressing the F1 key invokes Help. The F1 key doesn't perform a CLEAR
READ command in Visual FoxPro for Windows under the same circumstances.

WORKAROUND
==========

You'll need to modify applications written in FoxPro 2.x for Windows or FoxPro
2.x for MS-DOS that depend on the F1 function key to perform a CLEAR READ
command to make them do the same thing in Visual FoxPro for Windows.

Use an ON KEY LABEL assignment to force the F1 key to perform a CLEAR READ
command. For example, add the following line to the beginning of the program
listed in the "More Information" section, and run the program again:

      ON KEY LABEL F1 CLEAR READ

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create and run the following program:

      cMytest=""
      DEFINE WINDOW test FROM 1,1 TO 10,20
      ACTIVATE WINDOW test
      @ 2,1 GET cMytest SIZE 1,10
      READ

2. Press the F1 key, and Help will pop up.
