SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the 32-bit PowerPoint 95 viewer self-
extracting file Pptvw32.exe to create a PowerPoint Viewer disk set.

single 3.5-inch high-density disk.

NOTE: The information in this article does not apply to the PowerPoint Viewer 97
self-extracting file, Ppview97.exe. For information about creating a disk set
from this file, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
