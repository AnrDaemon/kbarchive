TITLE   :Qualifier 11 Using DFT Link Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server may send a Request/Response Unit (RU) to the DFT adapter that is
larger than the total buffer size on the adapter, which causes the DFT
connection to disconnect. The SNA Server logs an Event ID 23 with a Qualifier of
0x11 (DSR failure) when this problem occurs.

NOTE: Q137804 details another cause of an Event ID 23 with a Qualifier of 0x11
when you use a DFT Link Service on SNA Server.

CAUSE
=====

In order to prevent SNA Server from trying to send a message larger than the DFT
card can handle (about 970 bytes), the DFT link service needs to modify the
Maximum RU size field in a BIND received from the host to reflect the actual RU
size that it can receive before it passes the BIND request up to the SNA
Server.


RESOLUTION
==========

The Ibmdft.dll driver has been updated to modify the Maximum RU Size field of
the BIND request before it passes it on to the SNA Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
2.1, 2.11, and 2.11.sp1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA
Server 2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack,
