TITLE   :BUG: PictureBox Loses Graphics Printing from Win95 with 16-Bit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting kbVBp kbVBp400bug kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Graphics drawn on a picture box with the graphics methods do not appear when the
form containing that picture box is printed using the PrintForm method. Bitmaps
and/or icons print correctly. The AutoRedraw property has no affect on this
problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (and use the procedures detailed in that article): Alternatively,
the problem may also be avoided by setting AutoRedraw to true before any drawing
occurs on the picturebox to be printed. Before printing, set the Image property
of the Picture box to the Picture property. This can be accomplished with a line
of code similar to:

   Picture1.Picture = Picture1.Image

After these steps the graphics drawn on the picture box will print correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

Steps to Reproduce
------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 4.0 and Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a single PictureBox control and two command buttons to the form.

3. Add this code to Form1:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Picture1.Line (10, 10)-(500, 500)
            Picture1.Line (10, 500)-(500, 10)
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command2_Click()
            Form1.PrintForm
         End Sub

4. Press F5 or select Start from the Run menu to run the application. Click
   Command1 to add the graphics to the picture box, then click Command2 to print
   the form. After printing is complete, notice that the picture box on the
   printed page is empty.
