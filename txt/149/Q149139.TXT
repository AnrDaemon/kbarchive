TITLE   :FIX: Visual C++ Breaks ODBC CLongBinary w/ GlobalReAll Misuse
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfile kbDatabase kbMFC kbODBC kbVC kbVC400bug kbVC410fix kbGrpDSVCDB kbGrpDSMDAC kbDSu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running an application built using the MFC ODBC classes from Visual C++ 4.0 to
retrieve CLongBinary data from a database may result in one or both of the
following behaviors when performing a recordset move or requery:

 - Access violations.

 - Out of memory exceptions.

CAUSE
=====

There is a programming error in the MFC code that can lead to this behavior
where GlobalReAlloc is used incorrectly. The return value of GlobalReAlloc is
not used, so the global handle embedded in the CLongBinary recordset member
variable becomes invalid if GlobalReAlloc moves the virtual memory block. Refer
to the MFC source code, Dbrfx.cpp in Mfc\Src, and look at the use of
GlobalReAlloc in the CFieldExchange::ReallocLongBinary() function.

RESOLUTION
==========

A new implementation of RFX_LongBinary that avoids this defect in the MFC code
is available to assist you in correcting this problem. Simply download the file
as described below, run the .exe file to expand the source files, and then
incorporate them into your project. Replace all occurrences of RFX_LongBinary
with the new RFX_LongBinary_Alloc and rebuild.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:

   Alloc.exe (http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/Alloc.exe)
