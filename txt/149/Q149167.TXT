TITLE   :Unable to Allocate Resources from the NDIS Wrapper
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When AppleTalk Event ID: 46 errors start, Macintosh clients that are attempting
to communicate with the server stop responding. The NT machine will report:

   Event ID: 46
   description: Unable to allocate resources from the NDIS Wrapper.

Once this error begins, more Macintosh clients will hang and they will eventually
hang the Windows NT Server.

CAUSE
=====

In SFMATALK.SYS, the packet descriptors are allocated ahead of time from the
NDIS Wrapper. With several hundred Macintosh clients accessing the server, it is
possible that Windows NT will not have a packet descriptor ready when one is
needed.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 3.51. This problem
was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For information
on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
