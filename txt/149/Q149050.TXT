SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how the description that is listed in the Add-In Manager
for each registered add-in can be set and changed from the Visual Basic for
Windows integrated design environment (IDE).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps describe how to change the description for an add-in that is
listed in the Add-In Manager. For example purposes, these instructions modify
the Add-In Manager title for the Data Form Designer (VB\SAMPLES\DATAWIZ)
sample.

1. Activate the class module whose description should be changed. For the Data
   Form Designer (DFD), this class module is named DFDCLASS.CLS.

2. Open the Object Browser by pressing F2 or clicking Object Browser on the View
   menu. The Object Browser is displayed, and for the DFD, the selected
   "Library/Project" is listed as "DataFormDesigner."

3. Ensure that the class module that needs to have the description changed is
   selected in the "Classes/Modules" list box. In this case the selected item
   should be "DFDClass."

4. Click the Options button to open the Options dialog box.

5. In the "Description" text box, modify the string to whatever should be
   displayed by the Add-In Manager. Click OK and then click Close to exit. The
   project should now be saved and recompiled so that the changes will take
   effect when the add-in is used.
