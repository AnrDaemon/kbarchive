TITLE   :XCLN: Unable to Send or Save Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an attempt is made to send or save a message in Microsoft Exchange Windows
clients, the following error message is displayed:

   The item could not be sent. Network problems are preventing connection to the
   Microsoft Exchange Server computer. <OK>

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error will occur if your delivery location is set to have messages
delivered to your Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox and the Microsoft Exchange
Information Store service is not running.

In addition, you will not be able to save the message to your Inbox, save the
message out in message format, or print the message. The Microsoft Exchange
Windows client is unable to access the message object because the Microsoft
Exchange Information Store is not running and so it cannot correctly format the
message. You will be able to save the message in Text (.txt)or Rich Text Format
(.rtf).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of the Microsoft
Exchange Windows clients. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
