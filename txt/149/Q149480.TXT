TITLE   :BUG: END DO Cannot Be on Separate Lines in Fixed-Form Source
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Separating the DO statement's END DO block terminator by placing END and DO on
separate lines in a fixed-form source file causes the following compilation
errors to occur:

   error FOR3596: missing END DO statement

   -and-

   error FOR2173: column 6 non-blank on initial line in fixed-form source

   -and-

   error FOR3470: too many END statements or duplicate program unit

CAUSE
=====

The compiler fails to recognize the END DO block terminator when END and DO are
on separate lines in a fixed-from source file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Place the END DO block terminator on a single line in a fixed-form source file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
