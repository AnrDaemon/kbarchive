TITLE   :Changing Properties for Many Users Resets Logon Password Flag
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible under User Manager to select multiple users and to change their
common properties (all properties but the user name.) When you change the
properties for multiple users and one user has the flag "User Must Change
Password at Next Logon" enabled and another user does not, then changing any
other property of the users resets this flag for all users.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT versions
3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
