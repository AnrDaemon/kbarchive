PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug#: 1686 (2.00)

SYMPTOMS
========

If an application does the following in the Microsoft Access 2.0 or 3.0 version
ODBC drivers:

      SQLExecDirect(hstmt, "select * from any_table", SQL_NTS);
      SQLFetch(hstmt);
      SQLSetConnectOption(hstmt, SQL_AUTOCOMMIT, SQL_AUTOCOMMIT_OFF);

The error generated is:

   szSqlState = "S1011", *pfNativeError = 59, *pcbErrorMsg = 76
   szErrorMsg="[Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access 7.0 Driver]Operation invalid at
   this time."

CAUSE
=====

The Access ODBC driver generates an S1011 error if an attempt is made to turn
off the ODBC autocommit connection option while a result set is active.

WORKAROUND
==========

Either set the autocommit option before opening the result set, or close the
result set before issuing the SQLSetConnectOption command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the ODBC Access 2.00.2317
driver. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 2.00.2317 3.40.2505 ms access
