TITLE   :PRB: DIM() Intrinsic Function does not Support Complex Numbers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortran

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to use complex numbers as DIM() input arguments results in the
following compilation error:

   error FOR2325: wrong data type for argument number of intrinsic procedure DIM

The DIM() intrinsic function returns the difference between two input arguments
if their difference is positive, or it returns zero otherwise. The DIM()
intrinsic function no longer supports the use of complex numbers as input
arguments. Note only the real part of the complex numbers is used to calculate
the difference between the two input arguments.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the real part of the complex number, and use it as the DIM() intrinsic
function input argument.

-or-

Compile the source file using the /4fps1 compiler option.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Sample Code to Illustrate Problem and Resolution
------------------------------------------------

   ! Compile options needed: none

         real*8 d
         complex c1, c2
         c1 = (4.0, -1.0)
         c2 = (1.0, 4.2E3)
   ! comment the following line for first resolution
         d = DIM( c1, c2 )
   ! uncomment the following line for second resolution
   !      d = DIM( real(c1), real(c2) )
         print *, d
         end
