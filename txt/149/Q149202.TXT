SUMMARY
=======

MICROSOFT EXCHANGE CLIENT FOR MACINTOSH

NOTES FOR SERVER ADMINISTRATORS

If your Macintosh clients will be connecting through AppleTalk:

 - Run Windows NT Services for Macintosh on your Microsoft Exchange
   Server computer and establish a zone for that computer.
 - Tell your users what AppleTalk zone they will be connecting through.
 - Make sure your Windows NT MacFile name is the same as your Microsoft
   Exchange Server name.

If your Macintosh Clients are connecting through TCP/IP:

 - Make sure the Macintosh Client can ping the Microsoft Exchange Server
   name.

SETTING UP THE MICROSOFT EXCHANGE CLIENT ON YOUR MACINTOSH

Your Macintosh must have at least 8 MB of RAM to run the Microsoft
Exchange Client. If you have only 8 MB of RAM, and the system consumes
more than 3 MB, you need to remove some extensions for Microsoft
Exchange to run.

Before you start:

1. In Control Panels, double-click Memory.
2. Turn on 32-bit addressing.

We recommend that you use System 7.5.3 or later. Additionally, on the
Power Macintosh, we recommend that Virtual Memory be turned ON and set
to a minimum of 1 MB plus installed physical memory. For example, if
your Power Macintosh has 16 MB of memory installed, you should set
virtual memory to 17 MB.

Steps:

1. Insert the Macintosh Client compact disc into your Macintosh CD-ROM
   drive, or connect to a share on your network.
2. Open the Microsoft Exchange folder.
3. Double-click Microsoft Exchange Setup. Follow the instructions.
4. Run Microsoft Exchange. The Profile Wizard guides you through the
   process of creating a new profile.

Supported Protocols

Both AppleTalk and TCP/IP are supported. If you are using TCP for the
Macintosh, use version 2.06 or later.

FORMS ISSUES

To help users know which forms can be used on the Macintosh Client
without having to open every message, the Viewer displays symbols for
all messages that should have usable message contents (standard
messages, post notes, resend notes, send and read receipts, signed
messages, and out-of-office messages). Forms that cannot be displayed
fully on the Macintosh appear with a different symbol.

PERSONAL FOLDER FILES (.PSTs) AND MESSAGE FILES (.MSGs)

The file format for personal folders and message files is different
between Macintosh and Windows, so if you create one with the Macintosh
Client, you won't be able to read it with a Windows Client. The reverse
is also true. However, you can move messages from Macintosh to Windows
and back by placing them in a server store and retrieving them on the
desired platform.

INSERTING FILES INTO A PUBLIC FOLDER

To insert a file into a folder from the Microsoft Exchange Client for
Macintosh:

1. Log on to the Microsoft Exchange Client for Macintosh.
2. From the Tools menu, choose Customize Toolbar.
3. In the Available buttons box, highlight the File - Insert button.
4. In the Toolbar buttons box, highlight the button after which you want
   to place the File - Insert button.
5. Choose Add, and then choose Close.

To insert a file:

1. Click the File - Insert button.
2. Select the file you wish to insert.
