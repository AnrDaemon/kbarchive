TITLE   :XCLN: Send Mail Option in NT File Manager Won't Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose the Send Mail item from the Mail menu under the Microsoft
Windows NT File Manager, you may receive the following error:

   Mail could not connect to your Mail server.
   The configuration for the Mail server path is missing or invalid.

STATUS
======

Microsoft Exchange does not support the File Manager?s Send Mail option 4.0.
This is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On a Windows NT computer that has never had a MSMail 3.x client installed, the
Microsoft Exchange Client Setup doesn't add a Send Mail option to File Manager.

On a Windows NT computer that has previously had a MSMail 3.x client installed,
the Send Mail option may already exist. If it is run, it may attempt to start
and sign into a MSMail 3.x server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove the Send Mail menu item, remove the following entry from the
registry:

  HKey_LocalMachine_LocalMachine
   Software
    Microsoft
     WinNT
      CurrentVer
       Filemanager
        AddOns
         Mail File Manager Extension:
          REG_SZ:SendFl32.dll

Next log off, and then log back on, to Windows NT for the change to take effect.
