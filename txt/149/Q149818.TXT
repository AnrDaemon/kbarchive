TITLE   :WFW Cannot Log On To WinNT Domain across SMC Token Ring Switch
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11; winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Client computers running Microsoft Windows For Workgroups (WFW) and NWLINK on
the IPXODI Support Driver (Token Ring) and that are connecting to a Windows NT
domain controller across an SMC Elite Switch ES/1, will not be authenticated by
the domain. Instead, the following error message is displayed:

   No domain server was available to validate your password. You were logged on
   without password validation.

CAUSE
=====

The Token Ring switch changes the content of the Netlogon request packets that
the computer running WFW sends to the domain controller. As a result, the domain
controller does not recognize the Netlogon request and does not respond to it.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use the NDIS driver for your Token Ring card
instead of the IPXODI Support Driver (Token Ring).
