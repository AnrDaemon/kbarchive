TITLE   :Event 560, 562 When No Objects Have Been Selected for Auditing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you choose Audit on the Policies menu and enable the Auditing File and
Objects Access option in User Manager for Domains without specifying any objects
to be audited, event 560 and event 562 will be logged in the security log file.
Any action performed by the Administrator account in User Manager for Domains
(or Server Manager) will be logged as an event 560 for the Administrator account
and as an event 562 for the System account.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the Auditing File and Objects Access option audits all action
performed in User Manager for Domains (and in Server Manager).

RESOLUTION
==========

This is by design. Security Account Manager (SAM), by default, assigns security
access control lists (SACLs) to all objects it creates, and managing them with
User Manager causes an object access audit to occur.
