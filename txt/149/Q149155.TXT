TITLE   :BUG: Assertion Failure with ERR= and END= in READ Statement
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the err= and end= options together in a READ statement and performing a
formatted READ using an integer expression in a FORMAT statement causes the
following compile-time ASSERT failure message to be generated:

   Assertion failed: 0, file err_genex.c, line 6143

RESOLUTION
==========

Use literal constants instead of integer expressions with edit descriptors in
FORMAT statements.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

   ! Compile options needed: none

         integer, parameter :: lenrec = 25
         character*25 rec

         open (unit=1,file='test.dat',status='old')
         read (1,100,end=500,err=500) rec
   100   format (a<lenrec>)  ! Comment for workaround
   ! Uncomment the next line for workaround
   ! 100  format (a25)       ! Use literal values with edit descriptors
