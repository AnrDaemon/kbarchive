-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you access a help topic in Schedule+, you may get the following error
message:

   The Topic Does Not Exist. Contact your application vendor for an updated file
   (129).

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Windows 95 was installed as an upgrade over Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11. Windows for Workgroups 3.11 comes with Schedule+ 1.0,
and it's associated help file, Schdplus.hlp, is located in the C:\WINDOWS
directory. During Windows 95 installation the Schedule+ 1.0 help file is not
removed.

Schedule+ 7.0 also has a help file with the same name, but is located in the
Schedule directory. Therefore, multiple Schedule+ help files exist on the hard
drive causing the above error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Search your hard drive for all instances of Schdplus.hlp.

2. Rename the extra copies. NOTE: The only copy that should exist will be in the
   Schedule+ 7.0 directory.
