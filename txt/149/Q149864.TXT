SUMMARY
=======

This article describes when Microsoft Exchange replication traffic is
compressed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Directory Replication Traffic:

Inter-site directory replication traffic is compressed by the Microsoft Exchange
Directory service (DS) before these messages are submitted to the Microsoft
Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA). This is done regardless of the underlying
message transport.

Intra-site directory replication traffic is not compressed.

Folder Replication Traffic
--------------------------

Only the message body is compressed for both inter and intra-site folder
replication. Attachments are not compressed. Transports, such as RAS, may
compress lower level data streams.
