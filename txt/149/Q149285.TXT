TITLE   :FIX: C1001 When Initialize Array of Type Class with #include
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0,4.1,4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbVC kbVC500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), used with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you initialize an array of a user-defined type using an include file (see
the example in this article), the compiler generates this error:

   fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
   (compiler file 'msc1.cpp', line 899)

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two workarounds as described below.

 - Add a comma after the last element in the include file.

-or-

 - Compile the .cpp file with the /P compiler option. This generates a file with
   a .i extension using the same base name as the .cpp file. Rename the file so
   that it has a .cpp extension, and compile it, or simply compile the .i file
   using the /Tp compiler option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code
-----------

   .cpp File
   ---------

      // To reproduce the error, compile options needed: none
      // Define WORKAROUND to use workaround #1

      struct CMemTblMgr {
          CMemTblMgr(int);
          ~CMemTblMgr(void);
      };

      CMemTblMgr sm_mgrLst[] = {
      #include "CMEMTABL.INC"
      };

   Cmemtabl.inc File
   -----------------

      #ifndef WORKAROUND
         CMemTblMgr(1),
         CMemTblMgr(2)

      #else
         CMemTblMgr(1),
         CMemTblMgr(2),
      #endif
