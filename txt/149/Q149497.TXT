TITLE   :SMS Does Not Correctly Identify New Pentium Processor Speeds
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbother kbInventory kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On DOS and 16-bit Windows systems, Systems Management Server (SMS) will report
the newer Pentium processors that run faster than 66mhz as 66mhz processors.
Windows NT systems will report their inventory based on the current registry
configuration and are not affected by this problem.

CAUSE
=====

The processor normalization code that determines the processor speed does not
have the ability to identify the newer processors. These processors were
released after the SMS inventory code was written.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
