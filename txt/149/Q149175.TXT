TITLE   :Font, Cursor, and Redraw Problems with Adobe Type Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Remote control of a Windows or Windows for Workgroups client with Adobe Type
Manager installed causes one of the following two behaviors:

 - If ATM is enabled, menu and window fonts do not appear in the Quick Viewer
   window.

 - If ATM is disabled, screen redraws are not correct, most icons are not
   displayed, or the cursor is split in half (with a white space), and each half
   appears in mirror image.

CAUSE
=====

The ATM install replaces System.drv with Atmsys.drv in the [BOOT] section of the
System.ini. It also adds the following line:

      atm.system.drv=system.drv

RESOLUTION
==========

If the following changes are added to the System.ini [BOOT] section, both
problems are resolved.

      ;system.drv=atmsys.drv
      system.drv=system.drv
      ;atm.system.drv=system.drv

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
