TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Find Entry Point (DLL Name) in the DLL
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00 3.00b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you declare a Win32 DLL, the following error occurs:

   Cannot find entry point Mydll in the DLL

Mydll is the name of the DLL being called.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because all 32-Bit DLL procedure names are case sensitive.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this error, copy the function name, description, and parameters from
the Win32 API function Help file into your Visual FoxPro program file. This
documents the function in your code and ensures that the correct case is used.

For example, the GetUserName function retrieves the name of the user currently
logged onto the system:

      BOOL GetUserName(

         LPTSTR  lpBuffer,// address of name buffer
         LPDWORD  nSize // address of size of name buffer
        );
      Parameters

The lpBuffer parameter points to the buffer receiving the null-terminated string
containing the user's logon name. If this buffer is not large enough to contain
the entire user name, the function fails.

The nSize parameter points to a DWORD that, on input, specifies the maximum size,
in characters, of the buffer specified by the lpBuffer parameter. If this buffer
is not large enough to contain the entire user name, the function fails. If the
function succeeds, it will place the number of characters copied to the buffer
into the DWORD to which nSize points.

To call the GetUserName DLL in Visual FoxPro, use this command:

      DECLARE GetUserName in Win32API ;
         String @mybuffer, Integer @mybuffersize

If the same DLL was declared as:

      DECLARE GetuserName in Win32API ;
         String @mybuffer, Integer @mybuffersize

the following error message would display:

   Cannot find entry point GetuserName in the DLL.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
