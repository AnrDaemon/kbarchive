TITLE   :XADM: Isinteg Reports IPM Subtree Missing From IMC Mailbox
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You might receive the following error when running Isinteg, a utility that ships
with Microsoft Exchange Server:

   Error: <Mailbox & ID> "Mailbox - <X.500 path to the IMC>":
   IPM subtree missing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run Isinteg -pri, an error will be logged in the summary and you will
see the above error in the Isinteg.pri log. This error will be accompanied by 8
warnings when you run Isinteg -pri -verbose.

These errors are normal. By design Isinteg runs a check against each mailbox in
the private information store. When it checks the mailbox for the Microsoft
Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) it finds several structures missing.
These structures (Sent Mail, Deleted Items, and others) are not used by the IMC
and are therefore not created. These errors present no problem for the IMC.

The warnings that are logged when Isinteg -pri -verbose is run are listed below:

   Warning: <Mailbox & ID> "Mailbox - <X.500 path to the IMC>":
   IPM Subtree not in count database

   Warning: <Mailbox & ID> "Mailbox - <X.500 path to the IMC>":
   Sentmail not in count database

   Warning: <Mailbox & ID> "Mailbox - <X.500 path to the IMC>":
   Wastebasket not in count database

   Warning: <Mailbox & ID> "Mailbox - <X.500 path to the IMC>":

   Warning: <Mailbox & ID> "Mailbox - <X.500 path to the IMC>":
   Views not in count database

   Warning: <Mailbox & ID> "Mailbox - <X.500 path to the IMC>":

   Warning: <Mailbox & ID> "Mailbox - <X.500 path to the IMC>":
