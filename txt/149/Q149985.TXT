SUMMARY
=======

To use the NEC Ready Sound Card in Microsoft Flight Simulator, you must
configure it as a Sound Blaster 16 (SB16).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps assume your CD-ROM drive is drive D and that Windows is
installed in the Windows folder on drive C.

1. Run Flight Simulator Setup inside Windows. To do this, click Start, click
   Run, type d:\setup, and then press ENTER.

2. Create a Windows startup disk by following these steps:

   a. Insert a blank floppy disk into the floppy drive. This disk becomes your
      startup disk.

   b. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

   c. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

   d. Click the Startup Disk tab.

   e. Click Create Disk.

3. Create the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files listed below on the startup
   disk.

   Autoexec.bat
   ------------

     set sound16=c:\opti930
     c:\opti930\sndinit /b
     PATH C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND
     SET TEMP=C:\TEMP
     LH C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\MSCDEX /d:mscd000 /l:e /m:12
     C:\NECUTILS\LMOUSE.COM
     C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE
     C:
     CD FLTSIM5

   Config.sys
   ----------

     DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS
     DEVICEHigh=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE ram
     DOS=HIGH,UMB
     DEVICEHIGH=C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\DRVSPACE.SYS /move
     FILES = 35
     DEVICEHIGH=C:\dos\OAKV111.SYS /d:mscd000 /m:s /p:170p /v

   NOTE: If the drive is compressed, there is not room in memory to load the
   CDROM Driver. Use the REM command to remark out the lines above, that contain
   either MSCDEX or OAKV111.SYS.

4. Restart the computer with the startup disk in the floppy drive.

5. Run Fight Simulator Setup from the MS-DOS command prompt and test the sound
   card with Autodetect. To do this, follow these steps:

   a. At the "C:\fltsim5" command prompt, type "setup" (without the quotation
      marks), and then press ENTER.

   b. Use the DOWN ARROW key to select the sound card, and then press ENTER.

   c. Select Autodetect, and then press ENTER. Follow the instructions on the
      screen to complete the installation.

The above steps work on NEC Ready models 7022, 9012, 9022, 9522, and 9532. The
MS-DOS drivers are installed by factory default. They are also available after
the NEC Product Recovery CD-ROM has reinitialized the hard disk. If you need the
latest NEC Recovery CD-ROM, call NEC Technologies at (800)632-4525.

The MS-DOS sound card driver does not work correctly in a MS-DOS Window or in a
virtual machine.

After using the DOS sound card driver, the sound card needs to be reset before
the Windows sound driver works correctly. The sound card can be reset by
shutting down and restarting the computer, or the sound card can be
automatically reset by the Windows sound driver when you exit Windows.
