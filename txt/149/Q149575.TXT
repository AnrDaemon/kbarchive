TITLE   :Initial SMS Client Setup Generates "Error: 259"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows client undergoing initial SMS client setup shows setup progressing to
approximately 3 percent, then appears to exit the entire SMS setup procedure. No
SMS.ini is created, and the client is not set up. No error messages are visible
unless you use verbose mode (set smsls=1). Verbose mode will show "Error: 259".

CAUSE
=====

A few Windows for Workgroups computers have Winver (with no extension) instead
of Winver.exe. SMS client setup attempts to run Winver.exe to obtain version
information, and fails because Winver does not have an extension. This problem
will also occur if Winver.exe is missing altogether.

RESOLUTION
==========

Simply rename Winver to Winver.exe on the client. SMS client setup will now
operate correctly.
