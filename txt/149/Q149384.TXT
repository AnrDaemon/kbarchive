SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may receive the following
error message:

   Cannot open the online statement. Try again later.

When you click OK, you are prompted whether you want to disconnect. If you click
No, you receive a blank screen. If you then click Go To MSN Central from the MSN
icon on the taskbar, MSN operates normally.

Microsoft Network folder is missing or damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Remove and reinstall MSN.

 - Extract the Onlstmt.exe file from your original Windows 95 disks or CD-ROM to
   the Program Files\The Microsoft Network folder. The Onlstmt.exe file is
   located in the Win95_07.cab cabinet file.
