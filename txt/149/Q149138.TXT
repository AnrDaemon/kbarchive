TITLE   :BUG: F6804 or F6511 Error with Spaces in Namelist Input File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Performing a READ of a namelist input file that contains spaces in or between
the namelist variable objects causes one of the following run-time errors:

   run-time error F6804
   - illegal subscript in namelist input record

   -or-

   run-time error F6511
   - variable name not found

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove all spaces in or between namelist object variables from the namelist
input file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you use the sample namelist input file "test.in" as a reference, the F6511
error occurs under one of the following conditions:

 - A space precedes a comma separating two or more assignment statements as in
   this example:

      i = 3  , j = 4

-or-

 - A space separates an array from its subscript as in this example:

      x (3) = 2

The F6804 error occurs when a space is inside an array subscript as in this
example:

      "x( 2) = 1" or "y( 1, 1, 1) = 5"

Sample Code to Illustrate Problem
---------------------------------

   C Compile options needed: none

         integer i, j, x(3), y(1,1,1)
         namelist /thelist/ i, j, x, y
         open(7, file='test.in', mode='read')
         read(7, thelist)
         write(*, thelist)
         end

   Namelist input file:

   ---test.in---
   &thelist
   i = 3  , j = 4
   x (3) = 2
   x( 2) = 1
   y( 1, 1, 1) = 5
   / 
   ---end---
