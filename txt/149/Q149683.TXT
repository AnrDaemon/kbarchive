TITLE   :PCM Appears Blank on Startup When "Offer After" Not Expired
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


The Windows Package Command Manager (PCM) may display itself with a blank list of
package items when initialized. Everything appears to operate normally, but the
user may not understand why PCM displayed itself when there are no packages
available to install.

CAUSE
=====

If a package is distributed to a client, regardless of the value of the "offer
after" time/date, PCM will consider the package to be in a pending state.

The behavior listed above will occur when there are no other packages pending
that have expired "offer after" time/dates. PCM will read the client's
instruction (*.ins) file during initialization and during its scheduled polling
intervals. If it detects that there are packages pending, it will display its
window.

PCM will then enumerate the packages listed in the client's INS file, and if the
"offer after" date has expired, it will display the packages in the window. If
no packages have expired "offer after" time/dates, the PCM window will appear
blank.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
