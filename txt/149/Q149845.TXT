SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to horizontally align text or form fields in a
tabular format.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To horizontally align text or objects in a tabular format, follow these steps:

1. Apply the Formatted style to your text.

2. Use the Tab key to separate the elements you want to appear in a tabular
   format.

The Formatted style is mapped to the <PRE>...</PRE> element when you
save your Web page. The <PRE>...</PRE> element is designed to
preserve exact horizontal spacing of characters, including spaces and tabs, and
uses a fixed width font, such as Courier, to display your text. When you apply
other styles that map to other elements, such as Normal which maps to the
<P> element, extra spaces and tabs are ignored by the Web browser.
