NOTE: The Append.exe tool is not fully compatible with Windows 95.
Microsoft does not support using the Append.exe tool with Windows 95

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Append.exe tool only in real mode with Windows 95. You can issue
the APPEND command only once; subsequent uses of the APPEND command result in
the following message:

   Append already installed

The APPEND command has no effect when it is issued in an MS-DOS session within
Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use the APPEND command multiple times, boot your computer to a previous
version of MS-DOS. Or, use the PATH command instead of the APPEND command for
programs that are not in the current folder.
