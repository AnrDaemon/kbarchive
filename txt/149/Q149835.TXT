PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A user with full administrator permissions cannot use the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program to edit the Custom Attributes field specified in the
Custom Attributes tab under DS Site Configuration. However, the Service Account
and the account used to install the Microsoft Exchange Server can.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Custom Attributes are objects in the Schema. As such, an administrator must have
Administrator permissions in the Schema container. These permissions do not flow
down from the Organization, Site, or Configuration levels. By default, the user
account used to install the Microsoft Exchange Server and the account selected
as the Microsoft Exchange Service Account are the only accounts that have
Administrator permissions in the Schema container.
