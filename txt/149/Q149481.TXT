TITLE   :PRB: Debugging Past END Statement Puts You in Disassembly Mode
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortran

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Debugging source code and stepping past the main program END statement causes
the debugger to shift into disassembly mode, placing the cursor at the beginning
of the source code's corresponding assembly code listing.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In previous versions of Microsoft FORTRAN, when you stepped past the main
program END statement, the debugger generated the message "There is no source
line debugging information" and stopped the debugger.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Build the sample code provided in Developer Studio.

2. Start a debugging session by selecting Debug from the Build menu and then
   choosing Step Into.

3. Step past the END statement to cause the debugger to shift into disassembly
   mode and place the cursor at the beginning of the assembly code listing
   mainCRTStartup() procedure.

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile options needed: /Zi

         print *, 'Hello, World!'
         end
