SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to perform a command line Directory Export of the
Global Address List (GAL) using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

First, create an Export.ini file with the following contents:

   [export]
   basepoint=/o=<orgname>
   exportobject=mailbox
   informationlevel=full
   subcontainers=yes

On the above file, <orgname> is the organization name as seen in the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program's containers view.

Then, run the following command from an NT VDM (command prompt), or place it in
the properties of an icon:

   admin /e <path>\export.csv /o <path>\export.ini

In this case, <path> is the complete path to the file including the drive
letter and subdirectory.

This will create a comma delimited file that contains the mailboxes of all the
names in the organization's GAL.
