TITLE   :BUG: ASSERT Failure with String Assigned to User-Defined Type
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbFL32 kbFortranPSkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The compiler generates the following assertion failure message when you make a
direct assignment of a character string to a user-defined data type structure
variable:

   Assertion failed:
   (NTYPE(symbolptr->_var.initial.whole_value)==N_STRUCTURE_CONS) ||
   (((NTYPE(symbolptr->_var.initial.whole_value) == N_ARRAY_CONS) ||
   (NTYPE(symbolptr->_var.initial.whole_value)==N_ARRAY_SECTION)) &&
   (symbolptr->_name.xdim != NULL)), file err_geninit.c, line 648

   abnormal program termination

RESOLUTION
==========

Assign the character string to a corresponding user-defined data type structure
character variable member.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Sample Code to Illustrate Problem
---------------------------------

   ! Compile options needed: none

         type A
             character*8 s
         end type
         type (A) f
   ! comment the following line for work-around
         f = 'hello'  ! This line causes the assertion failure
   ! uncomment the following line for work-around
   !      f%s = 'hello' ! Ok, assignment to character variable member
         print *, f
         end
