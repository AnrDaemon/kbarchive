 - Microsoft Schedule+, version 1.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Mac OS (all) 
 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you design an Electronic Form for version 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for
the Apple Macintosh, the details will not be correctly displayed if the
addressee is a Microsoft Exchange Server recipient who has automatically been
added to the Personal Address Book in version 3.1c of Microsoft Mail for
AppleTalk Networks.

CAUSE
=====

This is not a problem with the Microsoft Exchange Server or with the Microsoft
Exchange Connection Gateway. The problem developed because of a change made
between versions 3.1c and 3.1d of Mail for AppleTalk Networks.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the Microsoft Exchange Server recipient addresses to the Personal Address
Book manually, or upgrade to version 3.1d of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk
Networks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Version 3.1d of Mail for AppleTalk Networks Macintosh client will show these
details correctly. The details can also be viewed successfully in either version
3.1c or 3.1d if a custom recipient has been manually created.
