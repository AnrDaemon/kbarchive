TITLE   :STOP Msg: "0x0000001E" Debugging a Visual C++ Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are debugging an application in Visual C++ and some of the required
DLLs for the application are located on a remote server, the following STOP
error message appears:

   STOP: 0000001E : (C0000005, 8019935D, 00000000, 0000000C)

   KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED

The STOP error occurs whenever a breakpoint is set and it is necessary for
Windows NT to access a DLL on the remote machine.

NOTE: This failure occurs with Visual C++ 4.0, but this is potentially a problem
with any software development environment.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, relocate the remote DLLs to the local computer that
is running and debugging the application.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.50 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
