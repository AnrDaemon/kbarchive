SUMMARY
=======

GetProcAddress() returns NULL when passing a valid ordinal value for a DLL's
exported function. The Macintosh Windows Portability Layer implementation of
GetProcAddress() does not support obtaining exported function addresses by the
function's ordinal value.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DLLs on the Macintosh are implemented using Code Fragment Libraries (CFM) on
Power Macintoshes. Apple's implementation of CFMs only allows symbols to be
exported by name. Therefore, you must use the exported function name to obtain
the function address.
