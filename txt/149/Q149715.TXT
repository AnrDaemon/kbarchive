OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows 95 using a batch file (Msbatch.inf), Setup may pause at
the Network dialog box. This can occur even though the "Express=1" entry exists
in the Msbatch.inf file.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the "Display=0" entry is not added to the Msbatch.inf
file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use any text editor (such as Notepad) and add the following line to the
[network] section of the Msbatch.inf file:

   DISPLAY=0

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur if the Msbatch.inf file was created using Netsetup
or Batch.exe, which is the only manner of modifying the Msbatch.inf file that is
supported by Microsoft.
