TITLE   :XFOR: Exchange MS Mail Connector Adds SNADS GatewayName
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When sending mail to a SNADS recipient via the Microsoft Exchange MS Mail
Connector, there is no need to include the GatewayName portion of the address
(GatewayName\DGN\USER).

If the GatewayName is included, the MS Mail Connector will reject the message as
bad because the address will be incorrect and appear as
"GatewayName\GatewayName\DGN\USER".

MORE INFORMATION
================

You must install the SNADS access component on the Connector PO to allow
outgoing SNADS mail from Microsoft Exchange. Once this is done, and the SNADS
address space has been properly set on the Connector, the Interchange service
will automatically insert the GatewayName portion of the address.

The same applies for replies to incoming SNADS mail because the reply address
will not contain the GatewayName portion of it.
