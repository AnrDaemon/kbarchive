SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server Admin allows the configuration of Idle Timeout and Idle Retry values

Use values within the valid range for Idle Timeout and Idle Retry Limit.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and 2.11.sp1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The valid range for Idle Timeout is 1 (1/10 of a second) through 300. The valid
range for Idle Retry Limit is 1 through 255.

SNA Server Admin will report the following errors when invalid Idle Timeout and
Retry values are entered for SDLC connections:

   Error: 3862

   The Idle Timeout is invalid.
   The range is from 1 (one-tenth of a second) through 300 (30
   seconds). The default is 300 (30 seconds).

   Error: 3861

   The Idle Retry Limit is invalid
   The range is from 1 through 255; The default is 10.

These errors are not reported if the SDLC connection is configured as Remote End
= Peer System.
