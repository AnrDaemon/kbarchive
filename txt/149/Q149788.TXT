TITLE   :BUG: Visual SourceSafe Books Online Isn't Properly Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbSSafe400bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual SourceSafe Books Online is not properly installed.

CAUSE
=====

The following lines were not included in the Infoview.ini file during the
installation of Books Online:

   [VSS.Settings]
   licensed.name=<licensedName>
   licensed.organization=<CompanyName>

Because the floppy disks have already been used, the installation program tries
to copy the proper settings from the Win.ini file. On this computer, there is
nothing to copy, so the [VSS.Settings] are not included. This situation may
occur when a computer that's running 16-bit Windows or Windows for Workgroups is
just set up, and disks have already been used to run the Setup.exe program.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the missing lines with appropriate information to the Infoview.ini file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Modify your Win.ini file on a computer that is running Windows for
   Workgroups. Remove any entries in the [User Info] Section of the Win.ini
   file.

2. Install Visual SourceSafe from floppy disks that have already been used to
   install Visual SourceSafe on another computer.
