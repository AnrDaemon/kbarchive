SUMMARY
=======

The Message Transfer Agent (MTA) has a built-in startup recovery method
(MTACheck). This method is automatically invoked if the MSExchangeMTA does not
stop cleanly.

This check scans and makes repairs to the MTA database files (DB*.DAT files in
the MTADATA subdirectory).

MORE INFORMATION
================

MTACheck generates the following events:

   MSExchangeMTA / Field Engineering #2119 - MTACheck start

   MSExchangeMTA / Field Engineering #2206 - Once for each internal MTA queue
   checked. The MTA queues are:

   XAPIWRKQ
   OOFINFOQ
   REFDATQ
   MTAWORKQ

   MSExchangeMTA / Field Engineering #2119 - MTACheck completed

The MTACheck saves the process results in the MTACHECK.LOG file located in the
<Exchange Server>\MTADATA\MTACHEK.OUT directory. It may take a few minutes
to a few hours to run the MTACheck, depending on the number of files in the
MTADATA directory.

You can run the MTACheck manually. To run MTACheck manually, type the following
at the command prompt:

   mtacheck /v /f <Log file name>.LOG

NOTE: You cannot run MTACheck remotely.
