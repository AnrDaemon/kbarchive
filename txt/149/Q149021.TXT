-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Microsoft Exchange users send messages to MS Mail for PC Networks users via
the Microsoft Exchange MS Mail Connector Interchange and request a Delivery
Receipt, the Delivery Receipt will not be sent to the MS Mail users. The MS Mail
Connector Interchange removes the Delivery Receipt as it crosses the Connector
because MS Mail does not use Delivery Receipts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MS Mail for PC Networks does use Read Receipts. However, the MS Mail Connector
Interchange will not re-map the Delivery Receipt to a Read Receipt because of
the subtle differences between a Delivery Receipt and a Read Receipt.

Delivery Receipt: The sender requests a receipt when the message is delivered to
the recipient's Inbox.

Read Receipt: The sender requests a receipt when the recipient actually opens the
message.
