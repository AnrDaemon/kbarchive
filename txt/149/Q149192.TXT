TITLE   :XFOR: Dir-Sync Agent Submits Custom Recipient Proxy Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) agent will send out
the proxy Microsoft Mail for PC Networks address (in 10/10/10 format) to
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks requestors, even if the requestors do not ask for
the specific gateway address type (either because the Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks postoffices do not explicitly ask for them or the access component is
not installed).

WORKAROUND
==========

This functionality is part of the product design. The only way to prevent any
custom recipient address from being sent out to the Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks Dir-Sync stream, is by:

 - Using trust levels.

 - Not exporting the recipient containers for the gateway custom recipients.
