TITLE   :FIX: Blank Child Record Added in One-to-Many Wizard Form
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a form using the One-to-Many Form Wizard, or the TXTBTNS class in
a form with a child grid, a blank record is added to the grid when the child key
field name is different from the parent key field name.

CAUSE
=====

The code in the TXTBTNS class of Wizstyle.vcx that adds the child record
incorrectly adds a blank record.

WORKAROUND
==========

Rename the key field in the child table to give it the same field name as the
key field in the parent table. Recreate the form with the One-to-Many Form
Wizard.

-or-

Change a line in the procedure code associated with the cmdAdd.click event in the
Txtbtns class of Wizstyle.vcx.

The following line:

      IF EMPTY(m.cChildKey) OR TYPE(m.cChildKey)#TYPE('oAddRec.KeyValue')

should be modified to read:

      IF EMPTY(m.cChildKey) OR TYPE('m.cChildKey')#TYPE('oAddRec.KeyValue')

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a table that has the following structure:

   Name:      Table_1
   Fields:    ID1        Character 10
              Field2     Character 10
              Field3     Character 10

   Add two records to Table_1 with the values AA and BB in the ID1 field.

2. Create a table that has the following structure:

   Name:      Table_2
   Fields:    ID2        Character 10
              Field2     Character 10
              Field3     Character 10

   Create an index on Table_2.ID2

3. Run the One-to-Many Form Wizard. In Step 1, choose Table_1 as the Parent
   table, choose ID1 as a field, and click the Next button. In Step 2, choose
   Table_2 as the child table, choose the >> button to select all fields,
   and then click Next. In Step 3, choose ID1 from the left drop-down list and
   ID2 from the right drop-down list to establish the relationship. Click the
   Finish button.

4. Click the "Save and run form" button. Then click Finish. Save the form as
   Table_1.scx. After the form is displayed, click the Add button.

5. In the Add Record dialog box, choose "Add record to child (Grid) only," and
   click the Add button. No record will appear in the grid. A record has been
   added to the child table, but the key field (ID2) is blank for the added
   record.
