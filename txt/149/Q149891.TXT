TITLE   :Programmatic System Shutdown Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to programmatically shut down a Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 system on
which no user is logged on, the shutdown does not succeed. (Shutdown APIs:
InitiateSystemShutdown(), ExitWindows*().) After the unsuccessful shutdown, all
system services remain operational and the system seems to be fully functional;
however, the only ways to shut down the system are to log on and perform a
manual shutdown or to perform a hardware reset.

CAUSE
=====

When no user is logged on to the system, the default logon screen saver becomes
active. When shutdown is initiated, the system terminates the screen saver but
stops the shutdown process.

RESOLUTION
==========

A modification was made to Winlogon.exe to correct this condition.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
