SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to launch a 16-bit Windows application and are using an older
version CTL3D.DLL, you may get a message stating there is "Not enough memory."

MORE INFORMATION
================

CTL3D.DLL is a dynamic-link library (DLL) file used to give an application's
user interface three- dimensional visual effects around such elements as edit
fields, option buttons, and dialog boxes. CTL3D.DLL is installed and used only
by Windows 16-bit applications; 32-bit applications use CTL3D32.DLL.

If you get a "Not enough memory" message while trying to launch a 16-bit Windows
application, and if you suspect an older version of CTL3D.DLL is causing the
problem, contact the application vendor for an updated copy of the DLL.
