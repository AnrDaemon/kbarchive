SUMMARY
=======

When you print from a program using colored fonts or non-bitmap graphics to a
color printer, the printed color may not match the color displayed on the
screen. Bitmap graphics printed from the same program are printed properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows 95 printing subsystem can use Image Color Matching to match colors
from the screen to printer output for bitmap graphics. It cannot do the same for
text or non-bitmap graphics unless the program has built-in Image Color Matching
support. This behavior occurs even if the Print TrueType Fonts As Graphics or
Use TrueType Fonts As Softfonts options are enabled, because of the printing
Application Programming Interface (API) calls made to print the document.

Programs that have built-in Image Color Matching capabilities can provide the
correct printed color output for all colors on a page including text and
non-bitmap graphics.
