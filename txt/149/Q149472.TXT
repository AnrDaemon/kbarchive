TITLE   :PRB: FOR3852 Error Function RESULT and [] Attribute Specifier
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode kbFortranPS kbLangFortran

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling a source file that contains a function that uses the "[]" attribute
specifier with the Fortran 90 function RESULT return type option causes the
following compiler syntax error:

   error FOR3852: syntax error detected between ) and RESULT

CAUSE
=====

The function RESULT return type option is a feature of Fortran 90 and is not
supported with the "[]" attribute specifier.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are using the function RESULT return type option, declare the function's
attributes using the !ms$attributes metacommand.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Sample Code to Illustrate Problem
---------------------------------

   !! Compile options needed: none

         program attrib
         write(*,*) newx()
         end
