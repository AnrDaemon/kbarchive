-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience problems trying to start a service using anything other than
the default LocalSystem account. Those problems include failure of the hourglass
cursor to disappear or an inordinate delay before the appearance of the
Attempting to Start Service dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

When starting a service with a specific user account, the service control
manager must verify that a valid user name and password have been provided. The
service control manager checks with each Network Provider for valid user
credentials.

If any of the Network Providers has trouble validating the user, the service
control manager will not complete successfully.


Additional query words: Start Services
