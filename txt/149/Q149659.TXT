TITLE   :Printer Driver Files Dated 6/3/80
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the <systemroot>\System32\Spool\Drivers\W32x86 directory, there are
several printer driver files dated June 3, 1980 (6/3/80). These printer drivers
are stored for compatibility with Windows NT 3.1 clients and applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows NT 3.1, all printer drivers are stored in the
<systemroot>\System32\Spool\Drivers\W32x86 directory. Because version 3.5
drivers are not compatible with version 3.1 drivers, printer drivers are stored
in a version directory in versions 3.5 and later. When a new printer driver is
installed, the driver version is checked and copied into the appropriate version
directory as follows:

   Windows NT 3.1 drivers:

      <systemroot>\System32\Spool\Drivers\w32x86\0

   Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 drivers:

      <systemroot>\System32\Spool\Drivers\W32x86\1

Because Windows NT supports both old and new printer drivers, both versions can
be set up on the same print server; both Windows NT 3.1, and 3.5 or 3.51 clients
will be able to access the correct version of the printer driver files.

The date on these files is set to 6/3/80. Setting the date back to 6/3/80 ensures
that the file name and date will not conflict with any other versions of the
driver that may be installed, and also allows multiple versions of a printer
driver to be installed.

During Setup, Windows NT checks the version of the printer driver and copies the
printer driver to the 0 or 1 directory. Then the printer driver is also copied
into the W32x86 directory to ensure compatibility with Windows NT 3.1, because
some Windows NT 3.1 driver installation programs or applications may still look
there for the printer driver. Finally, the date for the driver in the W32x86
directory is set to 6/3/80, a date which is earlier than the first release of
Windows NT. This ensures that the driver name and date will not be identical to
those of any other driver in the version directories.
