TITLE   :Incorrect Node Address In IPX Header Causes Broadcast Storm
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the IPX/SPX-compatible network protocol (Nwlink.vxd) on Windows
95-based computers on a network with IPX routing, network traffic may
intermittently increase dramatically, severely degrading network performance.
This condition is known as a broadcast storm.

CAUSE
=====

When you start a Windows 95-based computer that uses the IPX/SPX- compatible
network protocol, frames may be sent out with incorrect IPX header information
under certain circumstances. Specifically, the node (MAC) address is incorrect.
Novell NetWare servers and IPX routers try to respond to these frames by sending
to the incorrect address. Because there is no response, the servers and routers
continue to retry, eventually generating a broadcast storm.

This problem is especially noticeable if the IPX frame type is set to Auto. In
this case, the initial RIP and SAP packets that are sent out to detect which
frame type is in use on the network cause numerous responses to be sent to the
incorrect MAC address. The effect is less dramatic if the IPX frame type is set
to a specific type.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
