TITLE   :XCLN: Rights to Folder Require Reviewer Rights on Mailbox
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Granting Author rights to a folder within a Mailbox requires that the Mailbox
have at least Reviewer rights. Without Reviewer rights, the user will receive
one of the following messages when attempting to view the folder:

   The set of folders could not be opened. You do not have sufficient permission
   to perform this operation on this object. See the folder contact or the
   system Administrator.

-or-

   The set of folders could not be opened. The client operation failed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if User1 wants to grant User2 rights to a folder named Projects,
User1 must grant User2 at least Reviewer privilege to his Mailbox. By granting
User2 Reviewer privilege to the Mailbox, User2 will be able to see all Top-Level
folders. Also by granting Reviewer privilege to User2 on the Mailbox, User2 will
be able to see any Sub-Folders contained in Projects.

This behavior is by design. Microsoft Exchange clients may consider it a security
risk if the Microsoft Exchange user is only wanting to provide access to a
particular folder and not to their Mailbox. If this is the case, Microsoft
Exchange users should consider using public folders as a workaround for
providing access to specific folders.
