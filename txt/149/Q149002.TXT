TITLE   :BUG: Visual Basic Project Window Not Displaying Project Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbSSafe400bug kbVBp400bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the VBX files are not properly installed, Visual Basic normally displays a
"File didn't load, do you want to continue" dialog when a Visual Basic project,
which uses licensed VBX files, is opened.

However, when opening a Visual Basic project via the "Open New SourceSafe
Project" add-in menu item, if the VBX cannot find its license, the VBX fails to
load. Visual Basic stops loading the project at that point. There are no error
messages displayed, however, the Project window is empty.

CAUSE
=====

Visual SourceSafe uses the Visual Basic Add-in model Application.LoadProject
command when loading the Visual Basic project. Visual Basic goes into "silent"
mode, and does not inform the user or the add-in control about any errors it
encounters while loading the project. If errors are encountered, Visual Basic
just stops the loading process at the point the problem is encountered.

This problem can occur if the VBX software is not installed properly on the
machine where the problem is appearing. Therefore, the VBX refuses to load
because it cannot find a license file in the Windows system directory when
trying to load.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this problem by properly installing the third-party VBX
files. Verify all the license files are properly installed in the directory
where your Windows system files are stored. The loading problems should cease.

If properly installing the VBX files does not fix the problem, then make the
project files available on your local machine by starting up the SourceSafe
Explorer and executing a Get of the project files to a location on your machine.
Then start Visual Basic, and open the project via the File Open Project command.
If Visual Basic has any problems loading files, then the "File didn't load, do
you want to continue" dialog displays and you will know what file is causing the
problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a issue in Visual Basic version 4.0 for
Windows.
