SYMPTOMS

The Microsoft FTP client does not take advantage of multihomed workstations. By
default, the FTP client binds to the first IP address that can reach the remote
station for its control connection and uses that local IP address for any
subsequent PORT commands.

NOTE: For more information on FTP control connections, PORT commands, etc. please
refer to Internet RFC 959.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, install the fix mentioned below.

A new switch has been added to FTP to allow the use of multiple network
interfaces for data connections.The new switch is:

   -a

Use IN_IPADDR when binding.
