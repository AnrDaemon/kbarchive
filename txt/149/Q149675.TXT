SUMMARY
=======

When you try to send mail out a PCMTA connector to a DOS Microsoft MHS gateway,
you might receive the following error:

   Your message did not reach all or some of the intended recipients.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Check the following configuration in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program:

1. Verify that the Address Space on the PC Mail Connector has:

   TYPE    Address                   COST
   MHS                                  1

   If MHS is not a type, use New General to add it. Then Stop and Start the PC
   Mail Connector service.

2. Verify that the Site, Configuration, Site Addressing Object, Routing Tab for
   the MHS address is defined properly. If it is not, go back to step one and
   remove and recreate the address space.

3. Recalculate Routing on the Site, Configuration, Site Addressing Object,
   Routing tab.

4. On the MS Mail connector Properties Connections tab, verify that the Access
   component is hanging off the gateway PO. If it is there, but is not shown
   under the gateway MS Mail PO, remove the access component from the connector
   PO and reinstall it, so that it is pointing to the MS Mail gateway PO.
