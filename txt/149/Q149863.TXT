The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual Basic for Windows 32-bit project long filenames are converted to short
filenames when run by association under Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98,
Windows Me, Windows NT, or Windows 2000. Running by association is invoked by
double-clicking on a file in Windows Explorer or Windows File Manager.

CAUSE
=====

If the fully qualified path to vb32.exe contains any long filenames (for
example: C:\Files\Microsoft Visual Basic\Vb32.exe) when a project is loaded by
association from Windows Explorer or Windows File Manager, Visual Basic uses the
short filename to load the project. The short filename appears on the Visual
Basic design environment title bar. In addition, using the File/"Make EXE"
option on a Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me machine, the .Exe file uses
the short filename as well.

RESOLUTION
==========

For Windows Explorer
--------------------

1. From the Explorer View/Options dialog box, select the FileTypes tab. In the
   Registered File Types list box, select Visual Basic Project, and click on the
   Edit button. In the Actions list box of the Edit File Type dialog box, select
   open, then click the Edit button. In the Application used to perform action
   field, put quotation marks (" ") around the path to Vb32.exe as follows:

   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Basic\Vb32.exe" "%1"

2. Click OK to save the change.

3. Modify the Make EXE File and Run Program selections in the Actions list box
   in the same way as the edit selection in step 1.

Visual Basic now loads/makes/runs the project using its correct long filename.

For Windows File Manager
------------------------

1. From File Manager, select a Visual Basic 32-bit Visual Basic Program file,
   and select the File/Associate option. Select Change Type. Edit the Command
   field, placing quotation marks (" ") around the path to Vb32.exe, as follows:

   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Basic\Vb32.exe" "%1"

2. Click OK to save the change.

Now Visual Basic 32 loads the project using its correct long filename.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
