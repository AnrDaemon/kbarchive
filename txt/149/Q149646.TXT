TITLE   :No DTMF Tones on Presario While Using Speaker Phone
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Phone, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Microsoft Phone software on a Compaq Presario computer,
you cannot send DTMF tones while using Speaker Phone.

CAUSE
=====

DTMF tones are disabled while using Speaker Phone because of problems with the
Presario's preinstalled modem. Sending a DTMF tone while using Speaker Phone
would turn off Speaker Phone, hanging up the call.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DTMF, or touch-tone, is a method used by the telephone system to communicate the
keys pressed when you dial. Pressing a key generates two simultaneous tones, one
for the row and one for the column. These are decoded by the exchange to
determine which key was pressed.
