PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run ISINTEG with the "-fix" option, ISINTEG prematurely aborts
processing in test 22 of 24 when Jet_errReadVerifyFailure is returned within
CHKCNT::ECForcedDelAttach.

The screen output will look similar to the following:

   Starting test 22 of 24, 'reference count verification'
   Number of Ref Count processed = 730710, 85% percent complete. Ref check
   on Attachment returned JET_errReadVerifyFailure

   . . . . . SUMMARY . . . . .
   Total number of tests : 24
   Total number of warnings : 74
   Total number of errors : 0
   Total number of fixes : 862
   Total time : 15h:38m:57s

Additionally, ISINTEG will log something similar to the following:

   Error: Attachment[0036-00000056A015].RefCt: Failed to delete attachment table
   row (JET_errReadVerifyFailure) (Failed to decrement reference count on
   embedded message(ecNotFound-MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND)) Ref check on Attachment
   returned JET_errReadVerifyFailure

   . . . . . SUMMARY . . . . .
   Total number of tests : 24
   Total number of warnings : 74
   Total number of errors : 0
   Total number of fixes : 862
   Total time : 15h:38m:57s

CAUSE
=====

During processing, ISINTEG inappropriately returns an error, which results in a
process exit.
