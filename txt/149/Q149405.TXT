PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows 95 using the Safe Mode Command Prompt Only option, you do
not see the real-mode DriveSpace or DoubleSpace driver listed when you run the
MEM command with the /C or /D switch, even if you are using a compressed drive.

CAUSE
=====

When you start Windows 95 using the Safe Mode Command Prompt Only option, the
memory allocated to the real-mode compression driver appears as part of the IO
System Data entry instead of appearing separately.

RESOLUTION
==========

To view the real-mode DoubleSpace or DriveSpace driver in memory, start Windows
95 with the Command Prompt Only option instead of the Safe Mode Command Prompt
Only option, and then run the MEM command with the /C or /D switch.
