TITLE   :Unable to Install New Software in Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing new software in Windows 95, if you use the Close Program
dialog box to end the Copying Files or Inserting Disk task, you may not be able
to install any new software. If you try to install new software, you may receive
the following error message:

   Rundll32: An error has occurred in your program. To keep working anyway click
   Ignore and save your work in a new file. To quit this program click Close.
   You will lose information you entered since your last Save.

In some cases, the Install Program Wizard may seem to work, but the software is
not actually installed. You do not receive any error message when this occurs.

CAUSE
=====

When you end the Copying Files or Inserting Disk task, Windows 95 unloads
Rundll32.exe from memory, leaving Setupx.dll in memory. Setupx.dll cannot be
unloaded properly by Rundll32.exe because Rundll32.exe has already been
unloaded.

Note that similar situations can occur adding new hardware with the Add New
Hardware Wizard.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, restart Windows 95 and then install the new software.
