The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

Many Microsoft Exchange Administrators would like to automatically configure
certain Public Folder Favorites for all their users. This functionality is not
available in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To make it easier for users to add public folders to their favorites list, the
administrator can send email to the users with the set of public folder
shortcuts in the message. This message could also include directions on how to
add these shortcuts to the list of favorites. For example, the instructions to
the user might read:

Use the following steps to add the attached public folders to your list of
favorites. Follow these steps for each shortcut in this email message:

1. Double-click the shortcut in the mail message to open the folder.

2. On the File menu, click Add to Favorites.

Steps the Administrator Needs to Perform
----------------------------------------

1. Create shortcuts for all the public folders that need to be added to the
   user's favorites. To create a shortcut to a public folder:

   a. From the Microsoft Exchange client (Windows 3.x, Windows NT, or Windows
      95), select (highlight) the public folder.

   b. On the File menu, click Create Shortcut. This brings up the Create
      Shortcut dialog box.

   c. Enter the name that you want the shortcut to have, and click OK. This
      creates a shortcut file.

2. Create a new mail message addressed to all the users that are to receive the
   shortcuts. Attach all the shortcut files created in step 1.

3. Send the message.

Steps the User Needs to Perform
-------------------------------

After receiving the message with the attached shortcuts, the user needs to follow
these steps:

1. From the Microsoft Exchange client (Windows 3.x, Windows NT, or Windows 95),
   open the message that contains the attached shortcuts.

2. For each shortcut in the message, perform the following steps:

   a. Double-click the shortcut. This brings up another client window with the
      public folder open. If the client does not have permissions to that public
      folder, an error message will appear.

   b. On the File menu, click Add to Favorites. This adds the currently open
      public folder to the user's public folder favorites.

   c. Close the current window by double-clicking the icon in the top-left
      corner of the window.
