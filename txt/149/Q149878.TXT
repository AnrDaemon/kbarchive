TITLE   :Protocol Does Not Bind to Token Ring Network Card

SUMMARY
=======

Token Ring congestion and/or error messages may prevent network protocols from
binding correctly to a Token Ring network card. There have been situations where
TCP/IP failed to bind and NetBEUI succeeded to bind.

This article explains why one or more protocols do not bind to the network card.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After initializing, the adapter is opened for ring communication by a
DIR.OPEN.ADAPTER command. This command is issued by every protocol. If a 0x00
return code (success) is received, the adapter is in automatic receive mode and
frames may be transmitted and received using the direct interface.

However, under certain circumstances DIR.OPEN.ADAPTER (NdisOpenAdapter in NDIS
source code) returns NDIS_STATUS_OPEN_FAILED with Adapter Open Error 59 which
means the adapter detected that a ring parameter server is present on the ring,
but that the required response has not been received in the allotted time. This
indicates that the ring might be congested, experiencing a high bit-error rate,
or losing an abnormally high number of tokens or frames (IBM LAN Technical
Reference, page B-57.)

Because an error is returned, the protocol does not bind to the network card. The
physical network should be investigated.
