TITLE   :Unexpected Reinstallation of SMS Client with a New SMSID
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the SMS client software is reinstalled and the SMS client is reinventoried
with a new SMSID, the SMS Administrator will notice multiple SMSIDs for the same
computer from the SMS Administrator UI.

CAUSE
=====

When CLI_DOS.EXE, CLI_NT.EXE or CLI_OS2.EXE (CLISETUP) fails to open the SMS.INI
file (because, for example, the file is locked by another application), CLISETUP
assumes that SMS.INI does not exist and that the reason is because SMS is not
installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to SMS version 1.2.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server version
1.2.
