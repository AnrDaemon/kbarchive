======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP1, 3.0, 4.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to enter the central SNA Server's IP address in the
Distributed Link Service Setup dialog box even though the documentation
does not explicitly state this.

The following is a sample entry in the Distributed Link Service Setup
dialog box:

   

   Remote Link Service: \\100.120.3.4\SNADLC1

where 100.120.3.4 is the central SNA Server's IP address.

Use the TCP/IP address whenever there are difficulties with NetBIOS name
resolution. Using the IP address of the server prevents name resolution
from taking place.

Additional query words: prodsna service pack 1
