 - Microsoft Encarta 96 World Atlas for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Encarta 1996 World Atlas, when you click the Statistics (middle) button on
the Locator, the program appears to stop responding (hang). You are able to move
your mouse cursor around the screen, but clicking the mouse buttons does
nothing, and you cannot activate any of the program menus.

If you press and hold down the CTRL key while you press the ALT and DEL keys
(CTRL+ALT+DELETE), the Close Program window opens. Encarta World Atlas is listed
as not responding.

RESOLUTION
==========

Improperly configured CD-ROM caching can cause this problem. To resolve the
problem, use the steps below to turn off CD-ROM drive caching:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System icon.

3. On the Performance tab, click the File System button.

4. Click the CD-ROM tab.

5. In the Supplemental Cache Size: area of the File System Properties window,
   drag the slider all the way to the Small setting.

6. In the Optimize Access Pattern For: area of the File System Properties
   window, select No Read-Ahead.

7. Click Apply, click OK, and then click Close. If you are prompted to restart
   Windows, click Yes.
