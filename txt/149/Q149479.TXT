TITLE   :BUG: Cannot Scroll to End of Last Field in Format Editor
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot scroll to or view the end of a long character string constant in the
Format Editor when the field containing the character constant is the last in
the FORMAT descriptor, the string length is greater than a single line, and the
cursor has moved out of the custom field's client area. You can only scroll the
client area to the end of the field when a new field is inserted at the end of
the descriptor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a source file using the sample code in Developer Studio.

2. Highlight the FORMAT statement, and then start the Format Editor by selecting
   Fortran Format Editor from the Edit menu.

3. Select the last field in the descriptor list containing the string, "Really
   long character Character String."

4. At the end of the character string, begin and continue typing in the letter
   "x" (without the quotation marks) until the screen is scrolled out of the
   custom field area.

NOTE: Attempting to scroll to the end of the field using the scroll bar will not
work. To view the end of the character string constant, you must insert a new
field after it. This causes the custom field client area to be scrolled beyond
the character string constant to the new field.

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile options needed: none

   110   FORMAT( i4, 'Character String', G10.2, E10.2,
        + 'Really long character Character String')
