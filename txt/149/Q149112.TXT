TITLE   :Some Image Maps Do Not Work with IIS
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Some image map files may not work well with Microsoft Internet Information
Server (IIS) version 1.0 because of the syntax used for creating the map files.

CAUSE
=====

IIS uses the CERN specifications for image maps. Map files that use the
following syntax may work on other World Wide Web (WWW) servers but may not
function well on IIS:

   default file.htm
   file1.htm rect (0,1) (170,53)
   file2.htm rect (264,26) (349,53)
   file3.htm rect (187,23) (264,53)

The correct syntax for the above map data is:

   default file.htm
   rect (0,1) (170,53) file1.htm
   rect (264,26) (349,53) file2.htm
   rect (187,23) (264,53) file3.htm

NOTE: The rectangle range specifications occur prior to the destination HTML
file. For more information on creating image maps for use with IIS, see
Knowledge Base article number Q146573.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the fix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 1.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
