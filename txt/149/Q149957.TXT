TITLE   :SMS Shared Packages Can Change Existing Rights on NetWare
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDespooler kbPGC smsdespooler smsgeneral smspgc kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When sending a sharing package to a NetWare distribution server where a directory
already exists for the package share name, SMS will change the rights on that
directory and all subdirectories beneath it.

CAUSE
=====

When the Despooler places a package on an existing directory structure, it
cannot determine which rights will be adequate for that directory and the
subdirectories below it, and will change the rights for EVERYONE to RWCMEF
(Read, Write, Create, Modify, Erase, File Scan), depending on whether the job
was created with Read or Read Access selected.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, create the package with NO permissions set in the
Access box. Then, the package should inherit the rights from the parent
directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.x. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
