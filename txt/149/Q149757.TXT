TITLE   :Err Msg: The NetWare Compatible Shell Is Not Available
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you start Windows 95 or when
you access the network:

   The NetWare Compatible shell is not available.
   Contact your network administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services
(NDS) is removed but two files updated by the Microsoft Service for NDS are not
replaced with the original files.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want NDS support for a NetWare network, reinstall the Microsoft Service
for NDS. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q138596 Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services Readme.txt

If you do not want NDS support, follow these steps to correctly remove the NDS
services:

1. Reinstall the Microsoft Service for NDS and the Microsoft Client for NetWare
   Networks (if it is not currently installed). To reinstall the Microsoft
   Client for NetWare Networks, double-click Network in Control Panel, click
   Add, click Client, click Add, click Microsoft, click Microsoft Client For
   NetWare Networks, and then click OK. After the client is installed, install
   the Microsoft Service for NDS.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Network. Remove the Microsoft Service for NDS
   by clicking it and then clicking Remove. When you do this, Windows 95
   reinstalls the original files used by the Microsoft Client for NetWare
   Networks. When you are prompted whether to retain the newer versions of the
   Nwnp32.dll and Nwredir.vxd files, click No so that the newer files are
   replaced by the original files.

   NOTE: If you are prompted whether to retain any other files, decide to replace
   them with original versions only if doing so will not interfere with other
   programs.

3. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click No if you do not want
   NetWare support and then skip to step 4. If you want NetWare support without
   NDS services, click Yes.

4. If you do not want NetWare support, remove the Microsoft Client for NetWare
   Networks by clicking it and then clicking Remove. Restart the computer when
   you are prompted to do so.

NOTE: If you cannot complete these steps for some reason, renaming the Nwnp32.dll
file should cause the error message to stop appearing. Note that this method
does not correct the registry or replace the original files.
