TITLE   :XADM: Logon failure During Exchange Server Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You might receive the following error message when you run the Microsoft
Exchange Server Setup program:

   While attempting to start the MS Exchange System Attendant service, the
   following error occurred:

   The service did not start due to a logon failure
   MS Win NT 0xc002042d

CAUSE
=====

There are two reasons why this error might occur:

 - When the Microsoft Exchange Service Account was created, the checkbox labeled
   User Must Change Password at Next Logon was marked. If you haven't logged
   into Windows NT using this account and reset the password, when the Microsoft
   Exchange Setup program attempts to start the Microsoft Exchange System
   Attendant service, the service will be asked to change the account password.
   The service will not know how to change the password and it will fail to
   start.

 - An incorrect password for the Microsoft Exchange Service Account was
   specified.

RESOLUTION
==========

At this point, the Microsoft Exchange Setup program will display a dialogue
prompting you to enter the correct account name and password. If you entered an
incorrect password, you can simply enter the correct one in the dialogue box. If
the checkbox was marked, you will need to use the Microsoft Windows NT User
Manager for Domains to clear the checkbox. Then you can go back and enter the
account information in the dialogue box. In either case, once the correction has
been made, the Microsoft Exchange Setup program will be able continue.
