TITLE   :MoveFileEx API Does Not Work After Applying SP4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply Service Pack 4 for Windows NT 3.51 Server or Workstation, the
MoveFileEx API stops responding. Files that are marked for deletion or rename
upon next restart are not deleted or renamed when you restart the system.

CAUSE
=====

When you use the MoveFileEx API with the MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT parameter,
a setup program can mark a file for deletion, or rename, upon the next system
restart. This is needed when a specific file is currently in use by the system
and cannot be deleted.

The API appears to work, returns the correct error code, and the registry keys
are created. However, on restart the files still exist and the registry keys are
not deleted.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
