SYMPTOMS
========

Data transfer can occur very slowly when you are reading a video CD in an IDE
CD-ROM drive if the following conditions are true:

 - The IDE CD-ROM drive is configured as the slave device on an IDE channel,
   with another device (such as a hard disk) configured as the master device on
   the chain.

 - You are using protected-mode drivers to access the IDE devices, including the
   CD-ROM drive.

For example, playing an MPEG file from a video CD can cause the computer to seem
to stop responding (hang) due to the very slow rate at which data is being read
from the CD.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in the Ios.vxd file that causes excessive seeks on data
requests from the CD-ROM drive under these conditions. This results in
degradation in the rate of data transfer from the drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has released an updated version of the Ios.vxd file that corrects this
problem. The file is:

   IOS.VXD version 4.00.953 (3/19/96, 68,825 bytes) and later

To install the updated Ios.vxd file, follow these steps:

1. Download the IOSUPD.EXE file from one of the online services listed below to
   an empty folder.

2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the IOSUPD.EXE file you
   downloaded in step 1.

3. Follow the instructions on your screen.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:
