TITLE   :Redirected TREE /F Command Does Not Work in Windows 95 GUI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing a redirected MS-DOS TREE /F command at a command prompt within the
Windows 95 graphical user interface results in incomplete output. This behavior
occurs in both windowed and full-screen MS-DOS sessions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, issue the redirected TREE /F command after
restarting the computer in MS-DOS mode, or after booting the computer to a
command prompt.

To restart the computer in MS-DOS mode, click the Start button, click Shut Down,
click "Restart the computer in MS-DOS mode," and then click Yes.

To boot the computer to a command prompt, restart the computer. When you see the
"Starting Windows 95" message, press the F8 key, and then choose Command Prompt
Only from the Startup menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The TREE command is used to display the structure of a folder. The /F switch
displays the names of the files in each folder. The following examples
demonstrate the use of the TREE command with redirection:

To display the files in all the folders on drive C one screen at a time, use the
following command:

   tree c:\ /f | more

To print the list of files displayed using the previous example, use the
following command:

   tree c:\ /f > prn

NOTE: The TREE command (Tree.com) is an MS-DOS command. Tree.com is not installed
by Windows 95, but is available on the Windows 95 CD-ROM or from online
services. For information about installing the old MS-DOS tools included with
Windows 95, please see the following article:
