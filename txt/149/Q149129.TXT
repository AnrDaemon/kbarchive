TITLE   :PRB: LOCKING Replaced with SHARE= in OPEN Statement
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortran

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The compiler (Fl32.exe) included with Microsoft Fortan PowerStation version 4.0
for Windows 95 and Windows NT does not support the LOCKING statement used in
previous versions of the Microsoft Fortran compiler.

RESOLUTION
==========

The OPEN statement's SHARE= option replaces the LOCKING feature.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SHARE= option does not have the same functionality that the LOCKING
statement had. The SHARE= option does not support the locking of individual or
groups of records. The SHARE= option can only be used to lock or restrict access
to an entire file's contents.
