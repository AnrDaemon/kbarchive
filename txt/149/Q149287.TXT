KEYWORDS:kbsetup smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you upgrade an existing Systems Management Server site server by running
setup from the Systems Management Server compact disc, the "Systems Management
Server" program group will be deleted and recreated by the Setup program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to upgrade a primary site server, Setup.bat must be executed from the
SMSSETUP directory on the Systems Management Server compact disc. Next choose
"Upgrade Site" from the setup menu that is presented.

At the end of the upgrade process, the existing "Systems Management Server"
common program group will be deleted and then recreated with all of the standard
icons. Any additional icons, like the Crystal Reports icons or other custom
icons, will be deleted.

To avoid losing custom icons and those created by installing Crystal Reports,
rename the "Systems Management Server" group prior to performing the upgrade.

NOTE: Applying a Systems Management Server service pack does not affect the
program group in any way.
