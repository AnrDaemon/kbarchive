The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, the Platform field of a form (.scx file) or a
visual class library (.vcx file) shows WINDOWS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In a Visual FoxPro for Macintosh form, the Platform field contains the string
WINDOWS. This is different from FoxPro for Macintosh version 2.6 where the
Platform field of a form holds the string MAC.

The value stored in the Platform field affects the behavior of the COMPILE FORM
command. This command compiles only the records that are marked as WINDOWS and
ignores any other records. If an older .scx or .vcx file in your application
contains the string MAC, use the following steps to update the file and to
ensure that all the records are compiled:

1. Use <filename.scx> or use <filename.vcx>.

2. Change all Platform fields containing platform= MAC to WINDOWS.

3. Compile the form (.scx or .vcx) file by using the COMPILE FORM command.

NOTE: If you edit a form in the Form Designer, Visual FoxPro writes WINDOWS in
the Platform field regardless of the operating system you are using. Similarly,
if you transport a FoxPro 2.6 form to Visual FoxPro, the WINDOWS string will be
stored in the Platform field.
