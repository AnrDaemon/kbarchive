TITLE   :Interlnk May Report Drive Letters Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msdos

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Interlnk.exe driver to connect to a computer running
Intersvr.exe, the drive letters reported by Interlnk may be incorrect if your
computer is using disk compression or PC Card (PCMCIA) drives.

CAUSE
=====

Interlnk chooses drive letters based on the MS-DOS convention, which does not
apply if you are using disk compression or PC Card drives.

For example, on a computer with two floppy disk drives and a compressed hard disk
with host drive F, Interlnk displays redirected drives starting at drive G,
although the actual redirected drives start at drive D.

To determine the correct drive letters, assume that neither disk compression nor
PC Card drives are active, and determine the next drive letter after the last
physical drive. Assign drive letters from that point on, skipping any letters
that are actually assigned. Using the example in the paragraph above, three
drives redirected by Interlnk would be drives D, E, and G. (Note that drive F,
the host drive for drive C, is skipped.)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the Interlnk.exe program
included with MS-DOS versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, and 6.22. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
