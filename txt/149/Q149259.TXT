TITLE   :FIX: Class Not Registered Error When Starting Class Browser
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenvkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Class Browser, one or more of the following errors appears:

   OLE error code 0x80040154: Class not registered. OLE object is being ignored.
   Record number 13. OK, or Cancel

Clicking OK and selecting a class library from the Open dialog box causes the
following Class Browser error to appear:

   Unknown member OLECLASSLIST.
   Browser: classbrowser
   Object: classbrowser
   Method: setbusystate OK, or Cancel

When you click OK or Cancel, the following message appears where xyz is the name
of the class library you selected:

   Unable to create class list for xyz.vcx

CAUSE
=====

The Class Browser depends on the Outline Control (Msoutl32.ocx) to be registered
correctly in the Windows 3.x Reg.dat file. The outline control registration in
the Reg.dat file is missing or invalid.

RESOLUTION
==========

Register the Msoutl32.ocx OLE control by running the following command in
Windows:

   

      C:\VFP\SAMPLES\OLE\REGSVR32.EXE C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MSOUTL32.OCX

To run this command in Windows 95, click Run on the Start menu. To run it in
Windows 3.x, click Run on the File menu in File Manager.

If running the command does not fix the problem, rebuild the Reg.dat file, and
run the command again.

For information on how to rebuild the Reg.dat file, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q80393 How to Rebuild the Default Windows Reg.dat File


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft product listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual
FoxPro 3.0b for Windows.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is specific to Visual FoxPro 3.0 running under Microsoft Windows
3.x. When running Visual FoxPro 3.0 under Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft
Windows NT, the outline control will autoregister itself if needed.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Windows 3.x, unregister the outline control by running the following
   command (on the File Manager File menu, click Run):

   

      C:\VFP\SAMPLES\OLE\REGSVR32.EXE C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MSOUTL32.OCX /U

2. Start Visual FoxPro, and then start the Class Browser.
