   And Fax icon in Control Panel, click the set of personal folders in the list
   of information services, and then click Properties.

   to create a new .pst file or specify the location of an existing .pst file.
   If you want to create a new .pst file, type the path and file name for the
   new .pst file in the File Name box, and then click Open. If you want to use
   an existing .pst file, type the path and file name of the existing .pst file
   in the File Name box, and then click Open.

   If you are creating a new .pst file, the Create Microsoft Personal Folders
   dialog box is displayed after you click Open. Click OK to close the dialog
