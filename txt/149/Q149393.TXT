TITLE   :CrashOnAuditFail Activates on Shutdown with ProcessTracking
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.1,3.5,3.51,3.51 (all service packs)
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51 (all service packs) 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\CrashOnAuditFail is
enabled in the registry, and Auditing of ProcessTracking is turned on, then
during shutdown the system will always fail with a Stop error message reading:

   c0000244 (STATUS_AUDIT_FAILED)

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q140058
   TITLE : How To Prevent Auditable Activities When Security Log Is Full

CAUSE
=====

The failure occurs because an attempt is made to log the termination of a
process after the event-logging service has already been shut down. Therefore,
audit logging fails, and the blue screen is generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server version
4.0 or install the fix mentioned below.

To work around this problem, turn off the ProcessTracking auditing if
CrashOnAuditFail is enabled or install Server Pack 5 or later for NT 3.51

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT Workstation or Server version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
