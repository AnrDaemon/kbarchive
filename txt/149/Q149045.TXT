The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange 4.0 clients use Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) to communicate
with the Microsoft Exchange server. The support for RPC is built into the
operating system for both Windows NT and Windows 95. In MS- DOS and Windows 3.x
however, the supporting files are installed when the Microsoft Exchange client
is installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following is a list of the RPC files that are installed with the Microsoft
Exchange clients for MS-DOS and Windows 3.x:

Banyan Vines                      RPC16C8.DLL

NOTE: In the list, the C after the 16 indicates that the file is for client side
RPC using the listed transport. The DG indicates Data Grams. The last number in
the file name indicates the transport. You can use this to locate the RPC files
on Windows NT and Windows 95.

If one of the client-side RPC files is deleted, the client may not be able to use
the listed transport to communicate with the Microsoft Exchange Server by way of
RPC.
