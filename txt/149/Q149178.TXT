======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Systems Management Server uses a SQL Server database to store its
system information and computer inventory. When you upgrade the SQL Server
computer that contains the database for a Systems Management Server version 1.0
or 1.1 site, additional procedures are required to re-create some of the stored
procedures for the Systems Management Server database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the stored procedures are not restored, the Systems Management Server
Scheduler is unable to activate jobs that use the Include Subsites option. Jobs
will remain in a Pending state and will never be activated.

To re-create the stored procedures for a Systems Management Server database, use
the following steps:

1. Run the SQL script Sp_site.sql against the SQL Server that contains the
   Systems Management Server database. When you run the script, make sure that
   the Systems Management Server database is the active database. The
   Sp_site.sql script is located in the
   <Smsdrive>:\<Smsdirectory>\<Site>.srv\<Platform>.bin
   directory of the Systems Management Server site server.

2. You can use ISQL/w to run the script file. To use ISQL/w to run the script,
   start ISQL/w, connect to the SQL Server computer that contains the Systems
   Management Server database. Select the Systems Management Server database in
   the Database box, open the Sp_site.sql script that is located on the site
   server, and run the script. If the script has run successfully, only the
   following text is returned in the Results tab:

   This command did not return data, and it did not return any rows

3. If the Results tab displays "Invalid Object Name errors," you have run the
   script against a non-Systems Management Server database.

NOTE: You do not need to manually run the Sp_site.sql script for Systems
Management Server version 1.2 databases.
