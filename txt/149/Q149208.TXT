TITLE   :Large File Transfers Fail w/MS-DOS Router and IBM PC Support
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

File transfers that use the IBM PC Support Program's RTOPC utility to transfer
data from an AS/400 to a IBM-compatible computer may fail when you use the
MS-DOS SNA Server client's ROUTER.EXE.

One possible symptom of the failure is an unknown error 9999 returned by the IBM
PC Support program.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server MS-DOS Router was not properly handling an APPC verb timeout
condition if the APPC verb did not complete in 65 seconds. Instead of returning
a timeout error, the MS-DOS Router was returning AP_OK (no error).


RESOLUTION
==========

The ROUTER.EXE has been updated to correct the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.0, 2.10,
2.11, and 2.11.sp1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA
Server 2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack,
