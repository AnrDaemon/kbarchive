TITLE   :File Manager Can't View Permissions After NWCONV.EXE Is Run
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You create a subdirectory on the NetWare server, assign a user to the
subdirectory, and then revoke all permissions to the user. When you run
Nwconv.exe, you are unable to view the permissions on any subdirectory below
\APPS in File Manager, security, permissions on the subdirectory or any
subdirectory below that. You will receive the following error message when you
try to view the permissions:

   The security information for (directory path) are not standard and cannot be
   displayed. Do you want to overwrite the current security information?

Example
-------

On a NetWare server:

SYSVOL
   \APPS USER [           ] Assign no permissions assigned.
      \A
      \B

On the Windows NT server, after you run Nwconv.exe:

SYSVOL
    \APPS      No permissions have been assigned to the subdirectories
      \A       below APPS including groups that should have permissions
      \B       assigned.

CAUSE
=====

During the conversion, an ACE (access control entry) was added for the user with
no permissions, but not all of the NTFS attributes were correctly added to the
file. Therefore File Manager is unable to view the permission on the
subdirectories.

RESOLUTION
==========

Nwconv.exe code no longer adds an ACE to the ACL (access control list) for a
user that does not have any permissions assigned to subdirectories.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
