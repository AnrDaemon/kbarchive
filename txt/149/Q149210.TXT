Page 93: "Error: not a file you can link"
-----------------------------------------

When performing Step 3 on page 93, you might not have Paradox listed in the Files
of Type drop-down box. Furthermore, if you manually enter the Shipping.db
filename without selecting Paradox in the Files of Type field, you might receive
the following error when trying to perform Step 4:

   Error: not a file you can link.

This could be caused by not having the proper Paradox data filter installed for
Microsoft Access. To add or check the proper Access data filter, please use the
following steps:

1. Click the Start button, then click Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Control panel.

3. In the Install/Uninstall list, double-click Microsoft Access. If Microsoft
   Access is not listed, double-click Microsoft Office Professional.

4. When the setup program appears, click the Add/Remove button.

5. In the Options list, click the Data Access option (on the wording, not on the
   check box) and then click the Change Option button.

6. Click the Database Drivers option, and then click the Change Option Button.

7. Make sure a check is present for all filters related to Paradox database
   files. If some Paradox filters are not selected, click on the empty check-box
   to add these filters.

8. Click OK for each screen to return to the main setup program. The final OK
   should begin the setup of any new components that you added a check mark to.

   Once the Paradox filter is properly installed, you will be able to select
   Paradox in the Files of Type field as shown on page 93.
