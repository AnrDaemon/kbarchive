SYMPTOMS

In Developer Studio, if you use !ms$fixedformlinesize or the $fixedformlinesize
metacommand at the beginning of a fixed-form source file in the editor and type
in 132 or more characters on a single line, Developer Studio hangs or quits with
the following error:

Under Windows NT version 3.51:

   The instruction at "0x77f87dd1 referenced memory at "0xd072a417".
   The memory could not be "read".

Under Windows 95:

   No error message - Developer Studio hangs

beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In Developer Studio, create a new text file with the .for extension.

2. On the first line in column 1, type the following and save the file:

   " !MS$FIXEDFORMLINESIZE: 132 " (without the quotation marks)

3. On the next line, press the TAB key to move to column 7, and type the
   character x repeatedly beyond the 132 column mark in the editor.

4. Press the ENTER key to get to the beginning of the next line, and then press
   the UP ARROW key followed by the END key to get to the end of the text you
   typed in step 3. This causes Developer Studio to either hang or generate an
   Access Violation.
