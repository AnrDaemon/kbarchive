TITLE   :XSRV: Using the 1.0b Connection Gateway with Microsoft Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Although Microsoft Exchange provides the Microsoft Mail Connector for
connectivity with Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, administrators might
choose to use the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks Connection Gateway
version 1.0b.

This is accomplished by changing the Microsoft Exchange Connector postoffice to
route mail through the actual postoffice that hosts the 1.0b gateway.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A copy of the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks Connection Gateway 1.0b
Setup program is supplied with Microsoft Exchange for this purpose. The program
can be found in the following location:

   <exchsrvr>\connect\msmcon\bin\macsetup.exe

The steps to perform are:

1. Run MACSETUP.EXE and press ENTER after the first screen.

2. Choose to Remove (option #3).

3. Enter the path to the Exchange MAILDATA directory:

        <exchsrvr>\connect\msmcon\maildata

4. The following message will be displayed at the bottom of the screen:

      Convert Gateway Postoffice to Downtream Postoffice (Y/N):
      Choose "Y" to continue

5. On the next two prompts, enter the Network and Postoffice name through which
   Mac-bound mail should be routed. This is the postoffice where the old 1.0b
   gateway is installed.

6. Enter the path to the Microsoft Exchange Connection executables:

      (<exchsrvr>\connect\msmcon\bin)

7. Enter the path to the Microsoft Exchange Connection postoffice:

      (<exchsrvr>\connect\msmcon\maildata)

   Press ENTER after this last step.

Failure to complete these steps causes all outbound Mac mail to be queued up in
the 00000002.MBG mailbag because Microsoft Exchange assumes that the ATMTA will
pick it up from there.
