TITLE   :PC Rmt: Err Msg: ProcessRecvMail, fp_read Fails. Out of Memory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for MS-DOS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to retrieve a message addressed to 300 or more total individual
recipients, during the retrieval of the message, you may get the following error
message:

   ProcessRecvMail, fp_read fails.
   Out of memory.

CAUSE
=====

When you retrieve a message addressed to 300 or more individually addressed
recipients, the MS-DOS Mail Remote client may encounter a memory limitation that
results in the above error message.

NOTE: Other mail messages pending in the your mailbag will be retrieved
successfully during the session. However, the client will have to exhaust the
number of required retry attempts on the failing message to eliminate the error
condition and have the message returned to the originator with a non-delivery
report.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem can be corrected by creating a group definition on the postoffice
that contains the desired recipient list. Therefore, the retrieval of the
message by the MS-DOS Mail Remote client will not fail if the same number of
recipients are delivered via a group alias.
