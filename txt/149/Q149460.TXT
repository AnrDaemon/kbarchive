-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The 16-bit Visual Basic setup program does not detect a previously installed
32-bit Visual Basic installation.

CAUSE
=====

The 16-bit setup program does not detect a directory with a long file name, and
therefore cannot find the 32-bit Visual Basic installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Select the Custom option for the 16-bit Visual Basic setup program and select
the short file name version of the directory containing the 32-bit Visual Basic
installation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this issue and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install the 32-bit version of Visual Basic into the default directory. The
   default directory is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Basic.

2. Install the 16-bit version of Visual Basic. Note that the setup program
   recommends C:\VB as the default directory instead of the directory containing
   the 32-bit Visual Basic installation.
