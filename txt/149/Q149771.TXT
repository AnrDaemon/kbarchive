TITLE   :BUG: Rebind Fails if Retrieve Fields Are Set at Design Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you execute the Rebind method after changing the data on a Data control
bound to a DBGrid control with fields retrieved by clicking the right-mouse
button on the DBGrid control, clicking on Retrieve Fields clears the DBGrid
control but does not display the changed data.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this issue and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use a Recordset to retrieve Field names instead of using Retrieve Fields from
the right-click pop-up menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start the 16-bit or 32-bit Visual Basic 4.0. If it is already running, on the
   File menu, click New Project.

2. Add a Data control and a DBGrid Control to the Form1 form. Set the properties
   of the following controls:

   Control          Default Name        Property            Value
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

   Data Control     Data1               DatabaseName       BIBLIO.MDB
                                        RecordSource       Authors
   DBGrid           DBGrid1             DataSource         Data1

3. Right-click on the DBGrid control and click Retrieve Fields on the menu. The
   Column headers on the DBGrid control contain the names of the Fields.

4. Copy the following code to the Code window of the Form1 form:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Form_Click()
            'Change the RecordSource to the Titles table
            Data1.RecordSource = "Titles"
            Data1.Refresh
            DBGrid1.Rebind
         End Sub

5. On the Run menu, click Start, or press F5. Click on the form and note that
   the DBGrid control is cleared of all data.
