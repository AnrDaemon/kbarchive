   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

When you run Setup.exe from the Microsoft Exchange Server compact disc, a
message is displayed:

   Setup is searching for installed components.

The Setup program is looking for an installation of the Exchange Server services
and other related information in the registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To detect a previous installation of Exchange Server on your computer, the Setup
program checks the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under the following subkey:

   \Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup

The settings in this registry sub-key are similiar to this:

   AdminDest: REG_SZ : C:\EXCHSRVR\BIN
   MSMailConnector: REG_SZ : C:\EXCHSRVR
   Internet: REG_SZ : C:\EXCHSRVR
   Services: REG_SZ : C:\EXCHSRVR
   X400: REG_SZ : C:\EXCHSRVR

NOTE: C:\EXCHSRVR is the default path, but the path can be changed and the
settings in this registry sub-key display the actual installation directory
selected during Setup.

To Hide a Previous Installation of Exchange Server from Setup.exe
-----------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

of Exchange Server, perform one of the following steps:

 - Select the SETUP key and save it to a file, and then delete the key.

-or-

 - Temporarily modify these settings by completely removing the path.
