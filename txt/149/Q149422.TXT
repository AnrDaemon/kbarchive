SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to cause the Microsoft Exchange Server message
transfer agent (MTA) to create a crash dump file when a fatal error occurs
instead of stopping unexpectedly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the message transfer agent (MTA) encounters a fatal error on a computer
running Microsoft Exchange Server, the MTA normally stops unexpectedly. When
this occurs, a severity 16 event appears in the event log and the Services tool
in Control Panel indicates that the MSExchangeMTA service has stopped.

For troubleshooting purposes, you may want to configure Windows NT so that the
MTA creates a crash dump file when a fatal error occurs instead of stopping
unexpectedly. To do so, use the following steps.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Verify that Dr. Watson for Windows NT is configured correctly. To do so,
   follow these steps:

   a. Click Start, click Run, type "drwtsn32 -i" (without the quotation marks)
      in the Open box, and then click OK.

   b. Click OK again.

   c. Click Start, click Run, type "drwtsn32" (without the quotation marks) in
      the Open box, and then click OK.

   d. Verify that the Create Crash Dump File check box is selected.

   e. Verify that the locations in the Log File Path and Crash Dump boxes refer
      to the Windows NT folder. In Dr. Watson for Windows NT, the Windows NT
      folder is typically represented by the %windir% variable.

   f. Click the Visual Notification check box to clear it. This allows the MTA
      to create the crash dump file without any input from you. If this check
      box is selected, a dialog box is displayed when a fatal error occurs and
      the crash dump file is not created until the dialog box is closed.

   g. Click OK to close Dr. Watson for Windows NT.

After you perform these steps, the following registry values exist:

      Value name: Auto
      Value type: REG_SZ
      Value data: 1

      Value name: Debugger
      Value type: REG_SZ
      Value data: drwtsn32.exe -p %ld -e %ld -g

      Value name: UserDebuggerHotKey
      Value type: REG_DWORD
      Value data: 0

These values are located under the following registry key:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version
      \Aedebug

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

2. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe as appropriate for your
   version of Windows NT).

3. Locate the following registry key:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA
      \Parameters

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

4. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value
   (note case sensitivity):

      Value name: Raise Exception on fatal error
      Value type: REG_DWORD
      Value data: 1

After you perform these steps, the MTA does not stop unexpectedly when a fatal
error occurs. Instead, fatal errors generate exceptions and cause a crash dump
file to be created. The exception generated is 0xE005<xxxx>, where
<xxxx> is a number that represents the specific error that occurred, if
appropriate.
