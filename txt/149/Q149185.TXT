   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to reinstall the NWLINK protocol on a computer running Windows
NT, one of the following error messages may be displayed:

   The registry service subkey already exists.

   The registry subkey already exists.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT is unable to reinstall the NWLINK protocol because key registry
entries already exist in the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Remove all registry components for the NWLINK protocol and then restart the
computer.

You must remove the following registry keys:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NwlnkIpx
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NwlnkNb
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NwlnkSpx
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CCS\Services\NwlnkIpx
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CCS\Services\NwlnkNb
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CCS\Services\NwlnkSpx

NOTE: If the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinSock\Parameters\
Transports value exists, make sure that NwlnkIpx and NwlnkSpx strings are
removed from that value declaration.
