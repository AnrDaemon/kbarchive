TITLE   :XFOR: Failure While Accessing the Process Table
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange Server can be configured to participate in Directory
Synchronization as a Requestor (DXA Requestor) to a MSMail PostOffice DirSync
Server. Improperly including the DXA Requestor in the MSMail PO's Dispatch
program (from the command line or Dispatch.ini) will result in the following
error:

   Failure while accessing the process table.

This error can be found in the MSMail Dispatch Monitor and Dispatch.log.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error is a result of the MSMail Dispatch program's inability to read the
Process.glb file of the Requestor. The Dispatch program polls PostOffices on the
LAN for DirSync events. Dispatch.exe connects to PostOffices by logical drives.
You specify the location of the PostOffices to be connected and indicate how
they are to be connected from the command line, or in the Dispatch.ini. In this
scenario, the Microsoft Exchange Server is a DXA Requestor and is erroneously
included in the Dispatch process. While polling the DXA Requestor for DirSync
events, the Dispatch program tries to read the DXA Requestor Connector
PostOffice's Process.glb file. Although the Connector PO has a GLB subdirectory
(Exchsrvr\Connect\Msmcon\Maildata\Glb), the Process.glb file is not present.

Unlike MSMail Requestors, the DXA Requestor does not rely on the Dispatch program
for DirSync processing, rather it processes its own T1 and T3 times. T1 is
scheduled through the Configuration, Connections, <DXA Requestor>,
Schedule property page. As for T3, the DXA Requestor dynamically applies the
changes as soon as they arrive.

Adding MSMail Requestors to the Dispatch.ini is routine for MSMail PostOffices;
however, a Microsoft Exchange Server should not be added to the Dispatch
process.

NOTE: This error message will not prohibit the DirSync process from completing
successfully.
