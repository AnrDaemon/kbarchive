TITLE   :STOP Msg: "c000021a "- Using Local Path for Mandatory Profile
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you specify a local path for a mandatory profile location in User Manager for
a non-administrator account, the user will get the following error when logging
on at the server console:

   Unable to log you on because your mandatory profile is not available.

The following STOP message appears after the user clicks OK:

   STOP: c000021a

CAUSE
=====

Note that this problem only occurs for users logging on locally at the server
where their profiles are located. There are two situations that will cause this
problem. First, the profile may not actually be in the specified location.
Second, users may have a local path for the profile instead of a network path.
That is, if the profile is located in c:\users\default on the server A1 and the
Default directory is shared as \\A1\Default, the correct profile path
is\A1\Default\<profilename>. If c:\Users\Default\<profilename> is
specified, the profile won't be found, and you will get the above error
messages.

Administrators can use either the local path or the network path without
problems.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in Service Pack 4 for Windows NT version 3.51
and Windows NT 4.0 .

Administrators and other users can use either the local path or the network path
without generating errors.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3. 50 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
