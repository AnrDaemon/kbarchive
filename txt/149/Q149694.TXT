KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Pcmcia.sys fails with the following error on the Austin Business Audio DX4 100
Color Notebook computer:

   Could not start the Pcmcia service on \\<server name>.
   Error 0020: The system cannot find the device specified.

CAUSE
=====

The Pcmcia.sys that ships with Windows NT 3.51 Server and Workstation is not
compatible with the PCMCIA slot of the Austin Business Audio DX4 100 Color
Notebook.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Service Pack 3 or higher or copy Pcmcia.sys
from SP3 to the \\winnt35\sytem32\drivers directory, overwriting the existing
copy of Pcmcia.sys. Then go into the Windows NT Control Panel, open Devices, and
set PCMCIA to either manual or automatic start-up. If you set it to manual, you
will need to start the device through the Devices dialog box; if you choose
automatic, start-up will be automatic when a PCMCIA device is inserted in the
slot.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem was corrected in Service Pack 3 for Windows NT. For
