The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0

SYMPTOMS

In the Developer Studio editor, hanging indents beyond column 7 are not
preserved when editing fixed-form source code files. This does not occur when
editing free-form source code files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. From the Developer Studio Tools menu, choose Options. Click the Tabs folder,
   and set the auto-indent option to Default.

2. Create a new text file, and save it with the .for file extension.

3. Type in a new line of text in any column beyond column 7, and press the ENTER
   key. This will position the cursor in the same starting column on the next
   line.

4. Type some text on the new line to move the cursor back to column 7.
