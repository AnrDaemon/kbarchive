   C Compile options needed: none

         integer i

         string = "1"

         read(string, *) i
         print *, i             ! prints 0 (should print 1)

         read("7", *) i
         print *, i             ! prints 0 (should print 7)

         read(string, '(i1)') i ! work-around, perform a formated READ
         print *, i             ! prints 1

         read("17", *) i
         print *, i             ! prints 17
