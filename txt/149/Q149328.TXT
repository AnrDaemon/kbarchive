-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With the SSTab control, switching to a tab that has been previously made
invisible can cause application errors or GPFs. In testing these, exceptions
were raised in both TABCTL16.OCX and TABCTL32.OCX at these addresses:

   TABCTL16.OCX   0001:00004D88
   TABCTL32.OCX   0137:0578B4E5

This problem may also manifest itself at other addresses on different
configurations.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce
------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a single SSTab control to the form.

3. Add this code to the Form_Load event of Form1:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            SSTab1.TabVisible(0) = False
            SSTab1.Tab = 0
         End Sub

4. Press F5 or select Start from the Run menu to run the application. An
   application error or GPF will occur before the form finishes loading. This
   problem also occurs if an EXE is made and run.
