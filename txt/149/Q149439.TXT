TITLE   :Err Msg: "STOP 0x0000007B" on DEC AXP 2100 Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up Windows NT version 3.51 on a DEC AXP 2100A, Setup will stop with
the following error message shortly after you select the computer type:

   STOP 0x0000007B

CAUSE
=====

The 2100A does not work with the standard 2100 Series 5 hardware abstraction
layer (HAL) that comes on DEC's version of the 3.51 installation media.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you select the computer type during Setup, rather than accepting the
default (2100 Series 5), select Other and use the disk that DEC provides along
with the installation media. This disk contains the 2100A HAL. Setup will
continue normally.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DEC AXP 2100A is manufactured by Digital Equipment Corporation, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
