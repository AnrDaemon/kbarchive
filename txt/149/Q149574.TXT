KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer version 2.0 for Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to some Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enabled Internet Information
Servers (IIS), you may get one or more of the following messages:

   HTTP/1.0 403 Access Forbidden (Secure Channel Required - This Virtual
   Directory requires a browser that supports the configured encryption
   options.)

   -or-

   Unable to connect to (servername)

While this may happen with Internet Explorer for Windows 95, other SSL capable
browsers may connect normally with no errors. Currently, the only Microsoft
browser with SSL support is Internet Explorer 2.0 for Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

Internet Explorer version 2.0 for Windows 95 has problems connecting to some SSL
certificates. A new certificate will generally NOT fix the problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been fixed in the latest version of Internet Explorer 2.0 for
Win95. This new version of Internet Explorer is available to the public for
downloading on http://www.microsoft.com to address this issue.
