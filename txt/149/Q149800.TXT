SUMMARY
=======

When 3D Movie Maker starts, it automatically switches the resolution of the
screen to 640 x 480 pixels if the resolution is currently set to anything above
640 x 480 pixels. This allows 3D Movie Maker to fill the entire screen. If you
do not want 3D Movie Maker to automatically switch the resolution, disable
switching by changing the default display setting.

   simultaneously on the keyboard. The Product Info window will be displayed.

After following these steps, 3D Movie Maker will start in a 640 x 480 resolution
window if your current resolution is greater than 640 x 480.
