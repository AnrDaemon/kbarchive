======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An MFC application that statically links to the MFC library may cause strange
problems when it's run under Win32s.

One known problem with static MFC applications in Win32s occurs when one static
MFC application is started and then two instances of another MFC application
that dynamically links to MFC in the Shared Library (Mfc40.dll) are run. The
second instance of the Shared Lib MFC application will fail and return this
message:

   Win32s - Error. Initialization of dynamic link library failed. The process is
   terminating abnormally.

CAUSE
=====

The static MFC library uses the static version of the C Run-Time Library.
However, the static version of the C Run-Time Library was not designed to be
used in Win32s.

Visual C++ versions 4.2 and later do not support building Win32s applications.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the build settings for the application linking to MFC in the static
library to use MFC in the Shared Library (Mfc40.dll).

There are special versions of the Mfc40.dll and Msvcrt40.dll for running under
the Win32s platform that can be found in the \Win32s\Redist directory on the
Visual C++ 4.0 CD-ROM. These two DLLs will need to be distributed with the new
application.
