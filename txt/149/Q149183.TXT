TITLE   :PRB: Insufficient Memory If You Use PGUP or PGDN Key w/ Lists
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you press and hold the PGUP or PGDN key to navigate through lists in FoxPro
screens, then after a few times, you'll receive this error:

   Insufficient Memory


STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form, and place a list box on it.

2. Select the From Fields option in the list box's List Items, and select a
   field from a table such as Customer.Contact.

3. Generate, and run the form.

4. Open the Debug window, and enter SYS(1016).

5. Press and hold the PGUP or PGDN key on your keyboard to navigate up or down
   through the list.

Note the number returned by SYS(1016) in the Debug window. After a few times of
scrolling all the way down and all the way back up in the list, you should see
the number displayed in Debug increase because more and more memory is used by
the object. At some point (this varies from one system to anther), the error
occurs.
