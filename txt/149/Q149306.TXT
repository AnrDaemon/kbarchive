TITLE   :Unable to Open Oemnadd3.inf During Update of Service Packs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run the self-extracting executable file for Windows NT 3.51
Service Pack 4 and Service Pack 5, you may encounter a warning:

   PKSFX: (W18) Warning! OEMNADAP.INF already exists. Overwrite (y/n)?

If you continue, the extraction will complete but, subsequently, while running
Update.exe from the source just extracted, you may receive the following error
message:

   Noncritical Error

   An error has occurred.

   Unable to open the file <drive>:\<directory>\NTAS\OEMNADD3.INF

where <drive> and <directory> are the drive letter and directory name
from which the Service Pack 4 and Service Pack 5 files were extracted.

CAUSE
=====

The service packs were not properly extracted with the -d option. The -d option
extracts subdirectories needed for the update to function correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To extract the service packs, copy the self-extracting executable file to a
directory on your hard disk drive and type either of the following commands:

   <USERINPUT>sp4_351i.exe -d</USERINPUT>
   <USERINPUT>sp5_351i.exe -d</USERINPUT>

NOTE: This example applies to the x86 (Intel) Service Packs.

After you correctly expand the service pack files, run Update.exe again to
replace files that may have been missed during the first application.
