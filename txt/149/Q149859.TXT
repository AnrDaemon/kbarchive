SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft SQL 6.0 Setup does not provide mapping for invalid characters found in
computer names.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft SQL 6.0 provides mapping for invalid characters encountered in domain
and user names. By default, SQL 6.0 provides the following mapping for these
invalid characters:

   A backslash(\) in the domain name is mapped as an underscore (_).
   A hyphen (-) in user name is mapped as a number sign (#)

For example, the user name "domainname\a-username" will be mapped as
"domainname_a#username."

Such mapping is not available for computer names that contain invalid characters.
During Setup, an invalid character in the computer name will cause Setup to
display an error message; however, SQL setup will continue. Invalid characters
in the computer name will cause some problems in SQL connectivity.

SQL 6.0 considers the following characters invalid in computer names:

backslash (\)
space ( )
hyphen (-)
single quotation mark (')
at sign (@)
percent sign (%)
exclamation point (!)
ampersand (&)
period (.)
