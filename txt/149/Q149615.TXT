SYMPTOMS
========

A C1004 (Unexpected End of File) or C1060 (Compiler is out of heap space) error
may occur when comments are misused within inline assembly code.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Semicolons are used in assembly code to begin source comments. They behave
exactly the same way as using the C++ comment specifier (//). All text following
a semicolon is considered to be a comment. Comments terminate at the end of the
current line.

Sample Code
-----------

   void main(void)
   {
      _asm { int 3; }    // The closing curly brace is ignored because it's
                         // part of the assembly comment line

      _asm {             // This code works because no valid code follows
         int 3;          // the semicolon comment specifier
      }

      _asm { int 3 }     // This also works and is valid code
   }
