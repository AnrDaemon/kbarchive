TITLE   :XFOR: MSMI Terminating with Memory Access Violation, Event ID 23
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MS Mail Connector Interchange (MSMI) may terminate unexpectedly with the
following events reported to the application log:

   Event ID: 2380
   Source: MSExchangeMSMI
   Description:
   A memory access violation has occurred that prevents further processing of a
   message. The access violation that occurred is an attempt to read from
   0x480df78. Please refer to the immediately following event(s) logged by MS
   Mail Connector Interchange for more information on the message that could not
   be processed. (Exception address: 0x4496c2.)

NOTE: The exception addresses above are examples; they will not match exactly

CAUSE

The MSMI is freeing a block of heap memory before the actual process is done
with it. When the process tries to access this freed area of memory, an access
violation occurs.
