The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Netscape Atlas and other newer web browsers may fail to connect to Microsoft
Internet Information Server (IIS) when the server is using SSL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 1.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

IIS version 1.0 supports SSL version 2. Newer web browsers, such as Netscape's
Atlas, support the newest version of SSL (version 3). When the web browser
connects to IIS, it states that it is will use version 3 SSL. IIS does not
recognize version 3 SSL clients; as a result, the connection is immediately
dropped. This happens because the client never requests to use version 2 after
version 3 is rejected by the server.
