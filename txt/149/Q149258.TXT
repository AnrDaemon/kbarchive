KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove (or uninstall) Windows 95 on a computer that dual-boots with
Windows NT, you may receive the following error message when you restart the
computer:

   OS Loader V3.5 (or "OS Loader V4.0")

   Windows NT could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:

   <Windows NT folder>\System32\Ntoskrnl.exe

   Please reinstall a copy of the above file.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you installed Windows NT after Windows 95. The system
configuration and boot partition are both changed when Windows NT is installed.
In this case, these changes take place after Windows 95 has saved the uninstall
information, and the Windows NT-specific changes are not restored.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Run the Windows NT Repair Disk.

 - Reinstall Windows NT.
