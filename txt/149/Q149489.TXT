MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start 16-bit or 32-bit Visual Basic 4.0, or if it is already running, click
   New Project on the File menu.

2. Add a TextBox control to the Form1 form.

3. On the Insert menu, click Module to create a module. Copy the following code
   to the Module1 Code window:

         Option Explicit

         Sub Main()
            Load Form1
            Stop
         End Sub

4. Copy the following code to the Code window of the Form1 form:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Me.Show
            Text1.SetFocus
            'Uncomment the next line for Workaround
            'DoEvents
         End Sub

         Private Sub Text1_GotFocus()
            Text1.Text = "GotFocus"
         End Sub

5. On the Tools menu, click Options to display the Options dialog box. Click the
   Project tab and set Sub Main as the Startup Form.

6. Step through the application by pressing F8. Note that after the SetFocus
   event, the GotFocus event is skipped. If the DoEvents statement is
   uncommented, the GotFocus event will be fired if the application is not run
   in debug mode. If F8 is used to step through each line of code, the GotFocus
   event will still not be fired.
