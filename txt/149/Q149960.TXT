TITLE   :Macs Unable to Connect to PCM Server in Zones with Long Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


The Package Command Manager (PCM) for the Macintosh may report an error 5016 when
attempting to launch a package. A look at the Sms.ini file confirms that the
server list is correct. A manual connection to the server with the Chooser
application also works.

CAUSE
=====

This can occur if the zone and server names, including the '@' separator, exceed
32 characters. The Windows NT 'Services for Macintosh' (SFM) documentation
states that it will support 31 characters for the Zone name, plus the length of
the server name. This combination can exceed the 31 character length that is
being used by the Macintosh version of PCM.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, reduce the zone or server name so the combined
length is 31 characters or less.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
