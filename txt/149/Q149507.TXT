TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Change QuickWin Application Status Bar Color
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortran

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot change the status bar color in a QuickWin application.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In a Windows application, the status bar color is the same as the "Button Face"
Screen Element color in the Control Panel. However, status bars in QuickWin
applications are not true Windows status bars. Instead, they are their own
window created by the Fortran QuickWin subsystem and not part of or controlled
by Windows system services.

To illustrate this behavior, build a QuickWin application using the source code
below. Next, change the status bar color by selecting the Colors applet in the
Control Panel. From the Screen Element combo box, choose Button Face. Then
select a new color from the palette, and click OK. Note that the status bars in
all Windows applications assume the Button Face color except for QuickWin
applications.

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile options needed: /MW

         print *, 'hello, world'
         end
