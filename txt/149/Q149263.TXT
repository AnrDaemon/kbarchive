SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Exchange clients for Windows, when you edit a Microsoft Word
freedoc and choose to close it and return to Microsoft Exchange, you will be
asked if you want to save changes. You can choose either yes or no but there is
no cancel button. However, when you close and return from any other type of
document, you will also be given the cancel button.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of the Microsoft
Exchange clients for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
