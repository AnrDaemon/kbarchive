SUMMARY
=======

The Personal Forms Library is one of the containers available to Microsoft
Exchange users to house Electronic Forms Designer forms. The Personal Forms
Library is maintained by the default mailbox the user has configured in their
profile (this can be determined by selecting Tools, Options, Delivery, from the
Microsoft Exchange client).

Therefore, if the default Inbox is in a Personal Information Store (PST), the
forms are maintained in the PST. Since PST's are local to the computer, the
forms available in the Personal Forms Library will also be local to that
computer.

If the default Inbox is on a Microsoft Exchange Server (the default location),
the Personal Forms Library will be located and maintained on that Microsoft
Exchange Server in the Microsoft Exchange database file Priv.edb. If local
replication is being used, the Personal Forms Library will also be available
locally. This will allow the forms that are only available in the Personal Forms
Library to be available offline.

However, in the above case the Inbox and the Personal Forms Library are still two
distinct stores. If you install or copy a form to your Inbox, it will not appear
in the Personal Forms Library.
