The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With the 16-bit version of Visual Basic 4.0, the IniPath property of the
DBEngine object could be set to an application's .ini file. With the 32-bit Jet
engine, setting the IniPath property of the DBEngine object to
"C:\Windows\MyApp.INI" does not load the Paradox ISAM settings.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. The 32-bit Jet engine retrieves its settings from
the registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. To use the ISAM settings with the 16-bit Jet engine, place the following code
   in the Load Event for the project:

         DBEngine.IniPath = "C:\Windows\MyApp.INI"

   where the following appears in the MyApp.INI file:

         [Paradox ISAM]
         ParadoxNetStyle=4.X
         ParadoxNetPath=F:\ 
         ParadoxUserName=JoeUser

2. To place the Paradox ISAM settings into the Registry under
   "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VB and VBA Program Settings," use the following
   code:

       SaveSetting "AppName", "Engines\Paradox", "ParadoxNetStyle", "4.X"
       SaveSetting "AppName", "Engines\Paradox", "ParadoxNetPath", "F:\"
       SaveSetting "AppName", "Engines\Paradox", "ParadoxUserName", _
       "JoeUser"

3. To obtain the ISAM settings from the Registry, place the following code in
   the Load Event:

         DBEngine.IniPath = _
            "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VB and VBA Program Settings\AppName"
