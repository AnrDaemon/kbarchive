======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Right-clicking the mouse on the Remote Data Control (MSRDC) displays the
Properties menu item. Then select Properties, and a dialog box appears with the
Password field as one of its selections. The Password field only accepts up to 8
alphanumeric characters; any characters after that are ignored.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this issue and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


WORKAROUND
==========

When the Remote Data Control (MSRDC) is selected, the Microsoft Visual Basic
Properties window shows the Password property and allows you to enter more than
8 characters in the Password field.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 Enterprise Edition, 32-bit project.
   Form1 is created by default.

2. Add the MSRDC control to Form1.

3. Right-click the mouse on the MSRDC control, and select Properties.

4. Type "123456789" (without the quotation marks) into the Password field,
   watching what is actually being accepted by the field. Notice that you cannot
   type in more than 8 characters.
