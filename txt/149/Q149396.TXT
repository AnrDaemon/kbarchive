The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Dial-Up Networking to connect to a Microsoft Windows NT Remote
Access Service (RAS) server and your password has expired, you are disconnected
without an option to change the password.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you connect to a Windows NT RAS server with an expired password, you
receive the following error message:

   Password Expired. Contact your network administrator.

When you click OK, you are disconnected.

This behavior is by design. The updated files add the ability to change an
expired password using the Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking client.
