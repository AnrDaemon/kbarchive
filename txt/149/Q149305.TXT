TITLE   :PCMCIA Network Cards May Fail to Start During NT Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Installing Windows NT on a machine using certain PCMCIA network cards may cause
the following error message:

   The dependency service or group failed to start.
   This error prevented the network from starting.

To correct this problem, choose Yes to return to the network dialog box to
reconfigure the software. After you finish installing Windows NT and reboot your
computer, the network driver should start normally, giving you access to the
network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These messages usually occur when you use OEM network drivers. Windows NT can
only dynamically start PCMCIA network cards that are autodetected by the Windows
NT Setup program. OEM drivers, by design, are not autodetected by the Setup
program. Windows NT PCMCIA.SYS handles this special case by starting the network
driver without rebooting. This issue has nothing to do with the OEMSETUP.INF
file or OEM driver supplied by the network card manufacturer.

Currently, the following PCMCIA network cards can be autodetected and installed
without rebooting if the defaults are accepted and nonconflicting:

   3Com 3C589 Etherlink III PCMCIA Ethernet Adapter
   3Com 3C589B Etherlink III PCMCIA Ethernet Adapter
   IBM PCMCIA Ethernet Adapter II
   Kingston EtherRx PCMCIA Adapter
   National InfoMover NE4100 PCMCIA Ethernet Adapter

NOTES:

 - The Toshiba T4900 and IBM ThinkPads cannot use IRQ=10 (reserved for onboard
   soundcard).

 - The Compaq LTE-5x00 cannot use 2, 5, 10, or 11 if a docking station is using
   an NE2000-compatible network card.

Additional query words: autodetect autostart unattend unattended
