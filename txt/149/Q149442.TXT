TITLE   :Remote OLE Links Between Documents Are Broken
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the component files used by an application are created on a shared network
drive, the links established in the compound documents do not contain relative
path specifications. An application based on the exchange of data between the
various documents through OLE links will exhibit the following symptoms: If the
users move the client files to their local drives, the links between the
component files cannot be reestablished without unreasonable user intervention,
and the application cannot function properly. The application will report
various errors, such as "file not found."

CAUSE
=====

When the component files are created on or saved to the network directory and
then moved to identical relative positions on a different machine, the OLE links
in compound documents are being broken. The same functionality works correctly
if the files are originally created on the local drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT. For
