SYMPTOMS
========

A control added to a form at design time, such as a text box, is no longer
visible on that form during design time.

CAUSE
=====

The Left and Top properties of the control are set to a value outside the
boundaries of the form or set to a negative number. The SSTab control may also
reset these properties to a value outside the boundaries of the form.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Property windows, click the Object list box and click the control. Check
the Left and Top properties to make sure they are the appropriate values. If the
control is still not visible, set these values to 0 to place the control in the
Top Left corner of the form.
