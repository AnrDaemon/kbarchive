TITLE   :XCLN: Renaming Attachment Doesn't Change File Association
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you rename an attachment, the file association for that attachment does not
change. Therefore, the original application will still start when that
attachment is activated.

CAUSE
=====

When you attach a file in a mail message, the name and extension are stored
internally. If you rename the attachment giving it a different extension, the
file association is not changed. For example, if you receive a Test.dat
attachment and rename it to Test.doc, double-clicking it will not launch Word as
expected.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is by design. This way the user can change the name to something like "My
most excellent document" with having to worry about adding a .doc extension to
it. If you choose the Save As option, you will still see the original attachment
name.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
