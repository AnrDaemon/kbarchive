-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an SSTab, SSFrame or SSPanel control has the focus and a key is pressed, then
all of the Form level key events (Form_KeyDown, Form_KeyPress, and Form_KeyUp)
will be fired twice. This problem occurs only if the KeyPreview property of the
form is set to True.

RESOLUTION
==========

It may be possible to write code to ignore the second key event if focus is on
the tab control. This could be done by utilizing a global flag variable to
represent whether or not the key event had been raised before. Aside from this,
the best option is to avoid writing code that depends on this functionality.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE Project in Visual Basic, Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Draw a single SSTab control onto Form1.

3. Change this property of Form1:

   KeyPreview: True

4. Add this code to the form:

         Private Sub Form_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
             Debug.Print "Form KeyDown"
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_KeyPress(KeyAscii As Integer)
             Debug.Print "Form_KeyPress"
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_KeyUp(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
             Debug.Print "Form KeyUp"
         End Sub

         Private Sub SSTab1_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
             Debug.Print "SSTab KeyDown"
         End Sub

         Private Sub SSTab1_KeyPress(KeyAscii As Integer)
             Debug.Print "SSTab KeyPress"
         End Sub

         Private Sub SSTab1_KeyUp(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
             Debug.Print "SSTab KeyUp"
         End Sub

5. Press F5 or select Start from the Run menu to run the application. Click once
   on the SSTab to ensure that it has the focus. Then press a single key on the
   keyboard. Observe the output in the debug window to see that each form key
   event has been fired twice.
