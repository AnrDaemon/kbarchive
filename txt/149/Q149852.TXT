The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Automatic Profile Generator (Newprof.exe) reads a Profile
Descriptor File (.Prf) and creates a profile based on the information in this
file.

This article describes the changes that need to be made to the Default.prf file,
present in the client installation directory, in order to create a profile with
the default delivery location set to a local PST file. If the Default.prf is not
present in the client installation directory, run the Microsoft Exchange Setup
Editor.

After the Default.prf file is modified with the changes outlined in this article,
when users run the Microsoft Exchange Client Setup program, a profile will be
automatically created for them and this profile will have a PST file which will
be set as the default delivery store.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to set a local PST file as the default delivery location for a profile,
follow the steps below:

1. Edit the Default.prf file on the client installation share point.

2. Search for the [Service List] section which lists all the services to be
   added to the profile.

3. Look for an entry with the value Personal Folders. If it is present, note the
   entry name. For example if the entry was:

      Service2 = Personal Folders

   The entry name is Service2.

4. If an entry with the value of Personal Folders is not present, add a new
   entry to the [Service List] section with Service2. If Service2 was already
   taken with another service, make sure to change that service to the next
   available service entry. So, if the Microsoft Exchange Server was Service2,
   modify Microsoft Exchange Server to the next available Service entry. For
   Example, if the last entry in the section has the name Service3, then the
   next available entry will be Service4. Add the following lines to the
   section:

     Service2 = Personal Folders
     Service4 = Microsoft Exchange Server

5. In the Default.prf file, search for the [General] section. Make sure the
   following line is present in the [General] section:

      DefaultStore= Service2

6. Add the following section:

   [Service2]
   PathToPersonalFolders= c:\exchange\mailbox.pst
   RememberPassword=TRUE
   EncryptionType=0x40000000
   Password=

After making the changes outlined above, the Default.prf in the client
installation share point should have the following sections:

   ; ***********************************
   ; Section 1 - Profile defaults.

   [General]
   ProfileName=Delivery to  Local PST
   DefaultProfile=Yes
   OverwriteProfile=Yes
   DefaultStore=Service2

   ; *************************************
   ; *************************************
   ; *************************************
   ; Section 2 - Services and clients in profile.

   [Service List]
   Service1=Microsoft Exchange Client
   Service2=Personal Folders
   Service3=Personal Address Book
   Service4=Microsoft Exchange Server

   ; *************************************
   ; *************************************
   ; *************************************
   ; Section 3 - Default values for each service and client.

   [Service2]
   PathToPersonalFolders=c:\exchange\mailbox.pst
   RememberPassword=TRUE
   EncryptionType=0x40000000
   Password=
   ; *************************************

After the above changes have been made to the Default.prf file in the client
installation directory, users will have to run the Microsoft Exchange Client
Setup program for the profile to be automatically generated. This profile should
have the file Exchange\Mailbox.pst set as the default delivery store.
