PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0a; Win95:7.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you repeatedly switch between Outline view and Slide view, PowerPoint 7.0a
may stop responding. When this happens, you must force PowerPoint to quit, and
all unsaved work will be lost.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a screen redraw problem in PowerPoint 95a that causes
PowerPoint not to release GDI resources. If you exit and restart PowerPoint
before it stops responding, all the GDI resources are released.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft
PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0b.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain Office for Windows 95 version 7.0b.

If you have PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0a, you can obtain a patch to
correct this problem. For information about how to obtain this patch, please see
the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
