TITLE   :Serial Mouse Not Installed; Err Msg: STOP 0x0000001E
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you change the OverrideHardwareBitstring in the registry, the serial mouse
is not installed during the boot process and the following STOP error message
appears in Windows NT:

   STOP: 0x0000001E : (C0000005, 80118C84, 00000000, 0061008C)
   KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED

NOTE: The parameters may not all be exactly the same.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q102990 defines the OverrideHardwareBitstring
as follows:

   OverrideHardwareBitstring REG_DWORD 0x1 or 0x2 This entry is not usually
   present. When present, it specifies that regardless of whether it was
   actually detected, a serial mouse is present on the system. Add this value to
   tell the driver to assume the serial mouse is on COM1 (specified by the value
   0x1) or COM2 (specified by the value 0x2). This entry is useful if the serial
   mouse has not been automatically detected.

Windows NT expected the mouse to be present.


WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the OverrideHardwareBitstring from the registry, or make sure the mouse
is connected to the computer when Windows NT starts.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can
be solved.

Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
