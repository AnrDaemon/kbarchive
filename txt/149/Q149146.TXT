TITLE   :BUG: Incorrect Output with CARRIAGECONTROL='fortran' Option
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a formattted write operation to a file explicitly opened with
the CARRIAGECONTROL='fortran' option, the leading space passed with the input
data is not used as a carriage control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the following sample code, the File1.out file opened with the option
CARRIAGECONTROL='fortran' does not use the space created with the "1X"
positional edit descriptor in the WRITE statement as a carriage control.
Instead, the very first character in the variable "line" is incorrectly
interpreted as a carriage control. File2.out does not use the Fortran carriage
control option, so both the space and the character string are correctly written
to the file with no problems.

Sample Code to Illustrate Problem
---------------------------------

   C Compile options needed: none

         character*50 line

         line = 'carriage control'

         open(12,file='file1.out', carriagecontrol='fortran')
         open(14,file='file2.out')

         WRITE(12,'(1X,A50)') line  ! 1X not used as carriage control
         WRITE(14,'(1X,A50)') line  ! 1X used as carriage control
         WRITE(*,'(1X,A50)') line

         close(12)
         close(14)

         end

   Output - Screen:

   carriagecontrol

   Output - File1.out:

    arriagecontrol

   Output - File2.out:

    carriagecontrol
