-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using the Windows 95 Server Admin tools provided in the Windows NT Resource
Kit Version 3.51 Update 2 to look at security options on a mapped share, you may
not be able to select the Permissions, Auditing, or Ownership option buttons on
the properties sheet security tab.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem can occur if the location of the server tools is not in your path
statement. The Server Tools readme file states that the Windows 95 Server Admin
tools require that the path to the Srvtools be included in the Autoexec.bat file
(for example, path c:\srvtools).

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the path to the server tools directory to the path statement in the
Autoexec.bat file.
