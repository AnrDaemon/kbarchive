The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to use AppleScript to run a Visual FoxPro program and return a
value to AppleScript.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the following example, the AppleScript portion asks the user for a Customer
ID and then calls a Visual FoxPro program. The Visual FoxPro program then opens
a database, sums the order amounts for the Customer ID that was entered, and
returns the sum to the script. Then the script displays the result in a dialog
box.

1. Save the following FoxPro program file as MyQuery.prg in the Visual FoxPro
   folder:

     PARAMETERS lcCustID
      SET DEFAULT TO HOME()+"Samples:Data"
      OPEN DATA TestData.DBC
      SELECT SUM(Order_Amt) AS Tot_Ord_Amt ;
         FROM Orders ;
         WHERE Cust_Id=UPPER(lcCustID) ;
         INTO CURSOR Temp
      SET DEFAULT TO HOME()
      IF _TALLY > 0   && Check to see that any records where found
         RETURN Temp.Tot_Ord_Amt
      ELSE
         RETURN _TALLY
      ENDIF

2. Use the AppleScript Script Editor to save and run the following script.

   IMPORTANT: When typing the code listed below, replace the semicolons with the
   AppleScript line continuation character by typing Option+Enter in the Script
   Editor.

      copy (display dialog "Please enter the Customer's ID" buttons ;
         {"OK", "Cancel"} default answer "") to dialogResults

      if the button returned of dialogResults is "OK" and ;
         {the text returned of dialogResults} is not "" then

         tell application ;
            "Macintosh HD:Microsoft Visual FoxPro:Microsoft Visual FoxPro"

               activate
               Do Script "SET DEFAULT TO HOME()"
               Do Script ;
                  "myquery(["&{the text returned of dialogResults}&"])"
               display dialog the result

         end tell

      end if
