TITLE   :XCLN: '!' at End of URL Not Incorporated into Shortcut
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an Internet shortcut (embedded URL) is inserted into a message from within
Microsoft Exchange Windows clients, a '!' at the end of the URL is not included
in the shortcut.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you add the Internet Shortcut HTTP://WWW.<SOMEPLACE>.COM/TEST! into a
message, only the HTTP://WWW.<SOMEPLACE>.COM/TEST portion of the link will
be hot (noted by being the only part underlined).

This behavior is by design. Microsoft Exchange does not permit some punctuation
as termination. If it did, URL's inside of parenthesis or ending sentences could
be broken.
