======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Systems Management Server uses a SQL Server database to store its
system information and computer inventory. Before you upgrade an early version
(1.0 or 1.1) of SMS to version 1.2, you must consider the version of SQL Server
that contains the SMS database. Different versions of SMS require different
versions of Microsoft SQL Server, as detailed in the following list:

 - SMS version 1.0 supports SQL Server version 4.21a only.

 - SMS version 1.1 supports SQL Server version 4.21a and SQL Server 6.x.

 - SMS version 1.2 supports SQL Server SQL Server version 6.x.

SQL Server version 4.21a is supported only during the upgrade phase to version
6.x. SQL Server 4.21a is not supported for usage with SMS version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Upgrading SMS 1.1 to SMS 1.2
----------------------------

If your SMS 1.1 site has its database on SQL Server version 4.21a, complete the
following steps, in order, to complete the upgrade:

1. Shut down the site. To do this, run Setup.exe from the SMSSETUP directory on
   the SMS compact disc, click Continue twice, click Operations, then click
   Shutdown Site.

2. Back up the SMS database.

3. Upgrade SQL Server 4.21a to SQL Server 6.x.

4. Reset the site. To do this, run Setup.exe from the SMSSETUP directory on the
   SMS compact disc, click Continue twice, click Operations, then click Reset
   Site.

5. Upgrade SMS 1.1 to SMS 1.2.

Note that SMS 1.1 supports both SQL Server versions 4.21a and 6.x. This means
that you can upgrade SQL Server before upgrading from SMS 1.1 to SMS 1.2.
However, you must perform the SMS upgrade after the SQL Server upgrade.

If you plan to continue using SMS 1.1 with SQL Server 6.x, you need to run the
sp_site.sql script to restore the stored procedures used by SMS. For more
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q149178 Upgrading SQL Server Used for an SMS Database

Note that SMS 1.2 automatically restores the stored procedures if SQL Server is
upgraded.
