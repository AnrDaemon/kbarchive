TITLE   :File Manager Performs a Move Instead of a Copy
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to copy a compressed file from a Windows NT file system (NTFS)
partition located on a Windows NT 4.0 server or workstation using a down-level
client (for example, Windows 95 or Windows for Workgroups), the file is moved
instead of copied. This will only happen if you are using the File Manager
included with a down-level client.

If you do not have permissions to delete the file, the file will not be moved and
will instead be copied correctly. Windows NT File Manager and Windows Explorer
work correctly.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 4.0 is sending additional information about the file that down- level
clients cannot understand correctly. The File Manager on the down- level client
then attempts to move the file instead of copy it.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 4.0 has been changed so that the server will not send the additional
information to a down-level client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For
