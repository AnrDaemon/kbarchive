OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

SYMPTOMS
========

A Visual Basic program contains two forms with the second form containing a
RichTextBox control. When the first form executes a command to hide the
RichTextBox control on the second form and then the focus is set to the second
form, the RichTextBox control appears but the Visible property of this control
remains False.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start 32-bit Visual Basic 4.0, or if it is already running, click New Project
   on the File menu.

2. On the Insert menu, click Form to insert a second form into the project.

3. Add two RichTextBox controls and a Command button to the Form2 form.

4. Copy the following code to the Code window of the Form1 form:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Form_Click()
            Form2.RichTextBox1.Visible = False
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            'Show the second form as modeless
            Form2.Show
         End Sub

5. Copy the following code to the Code window of the Form2 form:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            'Show the Visible Property of the RichTextBox control
            'in the Debug window
            Debug.Print "The Visible Property is " & RichTextBox1.Visible
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Command1.Caption = "Show Visible Property"
         End Sub

6. On the Run menu, click Start or press the F5 key to start the program. Click
   the Form1 form and note that the RichTextBox control on the Form2 form
   disappears. Set the focus to the Form2 form and note that the RichTextBox
   control appears. Click the Command1 button on Form2 and note that the Visible
   property is False.
