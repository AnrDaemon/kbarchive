SYMPTOMS
========

After you download and install Unimodem V, you may receive the following error
message when you try to connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network:

   Cannot locate the Microsoft Network Data Center. Please try again later.

CAUSE
=====

If you click Open (rather than Save As) when you download the Unimodv.exe file,
the installation program places a copy of the Wsock32.dll and Wsock.vxd files in
the Windows folder. The Wsock32.dll and Wsock.vxd files required by MSN are
already located in the Windows\System folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove or rename the Wsock32.dll and Wsock.vxd files in
the Windows folder.
