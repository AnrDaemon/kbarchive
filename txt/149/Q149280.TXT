TITLE   :XCLN: Win16 Client Fails on Real Mode TCP/IP Protocol
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0; winnt:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Windows 3.x Exchange client with Windows 3.1 and the real mode
Microsoft Client 3.0 TCP/IP protocol, the Exchange client may not be able to
communicate with the server. The following errors may occur when trying to
perform a Check Name in a profile including the Exchange Server provider:

   The name could not be resolved. The Microsoft Exchange Address Book was
   unable to log on to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer. Contact your
   system administrator if the problem persists.

CAUSE
=====

The default installation of The Microsoft real mode Network Client TCP/IP
version 3.0 for MS-DOS does not copy one of the files (Wsahdapp.exe) that is
necessary for Windows Sockets support. This file is located on the Windows NT
versions 3.5 and 3.51 Server CD-ROM. You may find this file in uncompressed
format in \Clients\Msclient\Netsetup directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem follow these steps:

1. Manually copy Wsahdapp.exe from the CD-ROM to the directory where the Network
   Client for MS-DOS is installed; by default it is C:\Net.

2. Manually configure the Microsoft client, not the Exchange client, for Sockets
   support. For information on how to configure sockets support for Windows
   manually, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q128751 No "Advanced" button in Client TCP/IP Configuration

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0
for Windows 3.x. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
