TITLE   :BUG: 3426 and 3020 - Different Error Number With 16-bit/32-bit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:4.00 | 4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Recordset.Update is issued without first issuing an AddNew or an Edit
method, Visual Basic 4.0 correctly raises an error, because the Update method
can only be invoked after an AddNew or an Edit method. However, the error number
raised by the 16-bit and 32-bit editions of Visual Basic differs.

The 32-bit edition of Visual Basic version 4.0 for Windows returns the following
error:

   '3020' - Update or CancelUpdate without AddNew or Edit

The 16-bit edition of Visual Basic version 4.0 for Windows returns the following
error:

   '3426' - The action was cancelled by an associated object

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps To Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start the 32-bit edition of Visual Basic version 4.0 for Windows. Form1 is
   created by default.

2. Add a single text box and data control to the form.

3. Set the properties of the data control to the following:

      DatabaseName:     BIBLIO.MDB
      RecordSource:     Authors

4. Set the properties of the text box to the following:

      DataSource:    Data1
      DataField:     Au_ID

5. Add the following code to the Form_Click event of Form1:

         Private Sub Form_Click()
            Data1.Recordset.Update
         End Sub

6. Press F5 or click Start on the Run menu to run the application. Change the
   text in the text box and click the form. With the 32-bit version of Visual
   Basic version 4.0 for Windows, error '3020' is raised. If these steps are
   repeated with the 16-bit version of Visual Basic version 4.0 for Windows, the
   error raised is '3426'.
