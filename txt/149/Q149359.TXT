TITLE   :XADM: Configuring Mailboxes to Reject Distribution List Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0,5.5

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange administrators have the ability to set Delivery Restrictions
on individual mailboxes so that mail can be rejected or accepted based on who
the sender of the message is. If you use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator's
program to specify a Distribution List (DL) in the Reject Messages From listbox
on the Delivery Restrictions tab of a Mailbox's properties page, you should
expect the following behavior (where user is a member of the DL specified):

 - Any messages sent to the DL by members or non-members will be received by the
   user.

 - All members of this DL will be unable to send explicitly to the user. An
   important repercussion here is that the user will not be able to send mail to
   themselves because they are a member of the DL that has been restricted. The
   sender will receive the following Non-Delivery Report (NDR) generated by the
   MSExchangeMTA:

   A restriction in the system prevented delivery of the message.

In summary, the Reject Messages From option is not designed to prohibit delivery
of messages sent to a DL. It is designed to Reject Messages From senders who are
members of the DL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you want to stop delivery of incoming mail sent to a particular DL, use the
Inbox Assistant. For more information about the Inbox Assistant, please refer to
Online Help in the Microsoft Exchange client.
