OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a VI editor and try to open a Read-Only file on a File and Print
Services for NetWare (FPNW) server, it may open a new file for editing as if the
original was not there. However, when you use the VI editor on the same file on
a NetWare server, the file opens with no problems.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
