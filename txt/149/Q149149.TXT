TITLE   :No Network Access with LAN Workplace and TCP/IP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows 95 on a computer with LAN Workplace and the TCP/IP
protocol installed, you may not have network connectivity in Windows 95. For
example, Network Neighborhood displays only the Entire Network icon. Attempting
to open this icon results in the following message:

   Not connected to a working network

CAUSE
=====

LAN Workplace sets the Frame Type setting for the TCP/IP protocol to
ETHERNET_II, which is correct. However, the method it uses to do so causes
Windows 95 to assume that every protocol is using the ETHERNET_II setting, which
is not correct. This causes the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol to use the
ETHERNET_II setting, which causes the lack of network connectivity.

RESOLUTION
==========

Adjust the Frame Type setting for the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol. To do so,
follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. Click the Configuration tab.

3. Click the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol, and then click Properties.

4. Click the Advanced tab.

5. In the Property box, click Frame Type. In the Value box, click the
   appropriate setting.

6. Click OK, and then click OK.
