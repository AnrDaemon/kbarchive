TITLE   :BUG: ListView in Report View Mode Truncates First ListItem
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the View property of the ListView control is set to 2 - List, ListItem
objects may have portions of their Text property truncated. This results in, for
example, an entry of "Thi..." instead of "This is my text".

The following article details a somewhat similar problem with the Listview
control in List mode (rather than Report Mode) and can be found in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q149320 BUG: First ListItem Truncated with ListView in Report View

This article outlines the different symptoms of that problem in addition to
providing a different workaround.

RESOLUTION
==========

To fix this problem, set the column width of the ListView control before
displaying the items. Knowledge Base article Q147666 explains how to set the
width of columns in a ListView control in both List and Report modes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce
------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a single ListView control to the form.

3. Add this code to the form:

      Private Sub Form_Load()
         Dim lv As ListItem

         ListView1.View = lvwList
         Set lv = ListView1.ListItems.Add
         lv.Text = "This is a long text string"
      End Sub

4. Press F5 or select Start from the Run menu to run the application. Observe
   that the text of the ListItem is truncated.
