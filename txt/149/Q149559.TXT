 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51

SYMPTOMS

The Login.exe file in Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) does
not prompt the user to change the password after the password has expired. This
only occurs when the exit command is entered into the system login script (the
exit command is put into the system login script to ensure no user scripts are
run at login).

==========

To resolve this problem, install the fix mentioned below.

Remove the exit command from the system login script.
