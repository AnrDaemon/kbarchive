TITLE   :CACLS /C Doesn't Work with /T switch
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the CACLS/T parameter to change an access control list (ACL), the
command does not finish if the CACLS command also has the /C parameter provided
and an "access denied" error is reached. The CACLS command stops at the first
occurrence of an "access denied" error.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Cacls.exe security utility located in the %Systemroot%\System32 directory
displays or modifies access control lists (ACLs) of files. The CACLS /? command
yields the following output on its usage:

  CACLS filename [/T] [/E] [/C] [/G user:perm] [/R user [...]]

                 [/P user:perm [...]] [/D user [...]]
     filename      Displays ACLs.
     /T            Changes ACLs of specified files in
                    the current directory and all subdirectories.
     /E            Edit ACL instead of replacing it.
     /C            Continue on access denied errors.
     /G user:perm  Grant specified user access rights.
                   Perm can be: R  Read
                                C  Change (write)
                                F  Full control
     /R user       Revoke specified user's access rights (only valid with
                   /E).
     /P user:perm  Replace specified user's access rights.
                   Perm can be: N  None
                                R  Read
                                C  Change (write)
                                F  Full control
     /D user       Deny specified user access.

Wildcards can be used to specify more that one file in a command.
You can specify more than one user in a command.
