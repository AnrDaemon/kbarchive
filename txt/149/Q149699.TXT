            "SendMessageA" (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal wMsg As Long, _
            ByVal wParam As Long, lParam As Long) As Long

         Const MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP = &H4
         Const WM_LBUTTONUP = &H202

2. Place the following code in the DblClick event for the RichTextBox:

         Private Sub RichTextBox1_DblClick()
            Dim retval As Long
            retval = SendMessage(RichTextBox1.hwnd, WM_LBUTTONUP, 0, 0)
         End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default. Add a
   RichTextBox and a CommandButton to the form. Their names become RichTextBox1
   and Command1 by default.

2. Add the following code to the CommandButton's Click event:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            MsgBox "Click Event!"
         End Sub

3. Run the project. Double-click on the RichTextBox and click once on the
   CommandButton. The Click event will not fire on the first click. After the
   first click, everything functions normally.
