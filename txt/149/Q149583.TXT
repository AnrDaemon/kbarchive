The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a client sends a message, they receive an error message from the
MSExchangeMTA that states:

   An error occurred while transferring in a message C=<country>;A=<
   >; P=<Organization>;L=<servername> because the Directory could
   not be expanded to an O/R address.

   Event ID 178.

CAUSE
=====

The account designated as the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC)
administrator is missing an X400 address.

RESOLUTION
==========

You need to either give the administrator's account an X400 address or assign a
different account as the IMC administrator. Adding an X400 address is done on
the E-Mail Addresses tab of the account's property page. Assigning a different
administrator account is done by clicking the Change button on the IMC's
property page.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the IMC service is stopped with the administrator's X400 address missing, it
will not restart with a Dr. Watson and a 1067 error.
