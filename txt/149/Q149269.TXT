SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a printer queue using Line Printer Remote (LPR) printing to a
QMS printer that is connected directly to the network with a QMS CrownNet
Ethernet network card, you must enter the IP address in both the Host and
Printer Name fields of the Add LPR Compatible Printer dialog box. If the IP
address is only listed in the first field, the print job will not print. This
does not affect QMS printers with the QMS Classic network cards with Firmware
version 5.097 or above.

WORKAROUND
==========

To configure QMS printers with CrownNet network cards, do the following:

1. Select the printer in Print Manager and select Properties on the File menu.

2. In the Printer Properties window, select Other in the Print To box.

3. In the Printer Destinations dialog box, highlight LPR Port and click OK.

4. In the Add LPR Compatible Printer window, type the IP address of the printer
   in the "Name or address of Host providing lpd" and "Name of printer on that
   machine" fields. Click OK.
