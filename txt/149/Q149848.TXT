SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the correct use of the SQLMORERESULTS() function to
clarify the description in the Visual FoxPro for Windows documentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you read about the SQLMORERESULTS() function in the Language Reference, you
might expect that the function is used to return records sequentially from a
single query. This is not the case.

The purpose of SQLMORERESULTS() is to return results of multiple queries either
synchronously or asynchronously, batch mode or non-batch mode. These strategies
are for processing multiple result sets from multiple queries. Here are the uses
of these strategies:

 - Synchronous Batch Mode - if you want multiple queries to execute sequentially
   and then return all results at the same time.

 - Synchronous Non-Batch Mode - if you want multiple queries to execute
   sequentially, and you do not want the user to wait until all result sets are
   in to begin processing.

 - Asynchronous Batch Mode - if you want multiple queries to execute
   simultaneously and return the result sets at the same time.

 - Asynchronous Non-Batch Mode - if you want multiple queries to execute
   simultaneously and do not want the user to wait for all result sets to
   return.

Each of these strategies has its advantages and disadvantages. The developer
needs to choose the strategy to implement.

For further information on these strategies, please see Chapter 3 of the Visual
FoxPro Professional Features Guide.
