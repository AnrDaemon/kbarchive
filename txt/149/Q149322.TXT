TITLE   :FIX: Tag Changed Incorrectly After Linking to Invalid ImageList
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp400bug kbVBp600fix kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setting the Icons property of a ListView control to an invalid ImageList control
will correctly result in error '35613 - Uninitialized ImageList'. However, if
the Listview.Icons.Tag property is examined after this aborted attempt has been
made, it will have been set to the tag of the ImageList control. It should be
blank after an unsuccessful attempt to link to an ImageList control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add an ImageList control, a command button, and a ListView control to Form1.

3. Add this code to the form:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            On Error Resume Next

            ListView1.Icons = ImageList1
            MsgBox "Tag after linking to invalid imagelist: " & _
               ListView1.Icons.Tag
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            ImageList1.Tag = "ImageList1"
         End Sub

4. Press F5 or select Start from the Run menu to run the application. Click the
   command button. The message box that is displayed will indicate that the tag
   for the ImageList linked to the ListView control is 'ImageList1'; it should
   be blank.
