TITLE   :XCLN: The Form You Selected Could Not Be Displayed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a form on a Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client
computer that is running the Windows NT File System (NTFS), you will get the
following error message if restrictive permissions have been applied to the
Winnt\Forms subdirectory:

   The form you selected could not be displayed. An error occurred while
   installing a form.

CAUSE
=====

This is expected behavior and it will only occur if the form has not previously
been downloaded to, or purged from, the forms subdirectory.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the permissions on the Winnt\Forms subdirectory to include Change
Permissions for all users who will be using the Microsoft Exchange Windows NT
client on this computer.

You can also change the permissions, compose the form (this will cause the file
to be copied locally), and then reset the permissions.

NOTE: It is not recommended that you to restrict access to the forms subdirectory
because you may get the above error message again.
