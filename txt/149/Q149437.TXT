The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

When you set up Windows NT in a token ring environment, the token ring card
fails to bind if the card is not currently on a ring or if a hardware
loopback adapter is not installed. This is indicated by Event Log errors
about dependency services relating to the adapter card's failure to start.

For a token ring  card to initialize properly, it must either have
connectivity to a Multiple Access Unit (MAU), a Control Access Unit (CAU),
or a Lobe Attachment Module (LAM); or it must have a simulated connection,
such as a hardware loopback adapter, installed. Make sure the computer on
which you want to install Windows NT either is connected to a correctly
functioning ring or has a hardware loopback adapter installed.

The components of a correctly functioning ring are interrelated as follows.
CAU and LAM components can replace a MAU. The CAU adds power and port
monitoring capability to any connected LAMs. The LAM looks like a MAU but
has 20 connections instead of 8. The ring-in and ring-out connections
on the CAU extend the connectivity of token ring networks. You can intermix
MAUs with CAUs and LAMs but you cannot provide any monitoring capability to
the MAU ports. One CAU can support up to four LAMs for a total of 80
connections.
