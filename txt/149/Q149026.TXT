TITLE   :Encarta 1996: Generic Icon Appears for CD-ROM Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 96 Encyclopedia for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert the Encarta compact disc into your CD-ROM drive, a generic-
looking icon represents the disc on the screen.

The icon is white and contains the Windows logo.

CAUSE
=====

The Encarta 96 compact disc contains an incorrectly named icon file.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no resolution to this problem. No program functionality is lost.
However, Windows will not automatically update the CD-ROM icon for other Autorun
compact discs after the Encarta compact disc has been inserted. Restart Windows
to solve this minor problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Encarta Encyclopedia 1996a
edition. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you insert the disc, Windows looks for a particular file containing
information about icon appearance. Because the file isn't found, Windows uses a
generic icon.
