TITLE   :CSNW Clients May Cause Clipper Index Corruption
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Clipper applications that are run on a Windows NT client using Client Services
for NetWare (CSNW) may corrupt Clipper database index files maintained on a
Novell or Novell-compatible server.

CAUSE
=====

In some cases, a file with a read-associated cache can become old when a write
overlaps the read cache.

The corruption is caused by old data being read in from the read cache; Clipper
then uses that data to build the index file. For example, the following sequence
on reads and writes results in index corruption:

1. A Clipper application builds a database and index from data set 1.

2. The Clipper application reads data set 2.

3. The Clipper application reads the database file with data set 1 and caches
   it.

4. The Clipper application writes to the database with data from data set 2.

5. The Clipper application re-reads the database with data from set 1 using the
   stale read cache.

6. The Clipper application builds the incorrect index file from the stale
   database read from the cache.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Window NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT Workstation
or Server version 3.51. For information on obtaining this update, query on the
