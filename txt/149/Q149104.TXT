TITLE   :New Users Not Prompted to Change Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a new user and select the "User Must Change Password at Next
Logon" option, the new user may not be prompted to change the password the first
time he or she logs on. This problem will occur if a new global group has been
created and then set as the primary group for the new user, and all other group
memberships removed. Even though the password option is enabled when the new
user is created, the setting is maintained during the initial creation of the
account. This only applies to new users that are created after a new global
group has been created.


RESOLUTION
==========

After adding the new user, the administrator will have to edit the user account
properties and reselect "User Must Change the Password at Next Logon." The user
will then be prompted to change the password at the first logon.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.51 and 4.0.
