TITLE   :IBM CA/400 Gathers Incomplete List of Partner APPC LU Aliases
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.1,2.11,3.0 (all SP)
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.1, 2.11, 3.0 (all SP) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use IBM Client Access/400 v3r1 on top of the SNA Windows 3.x client,
and you select the Cancel Button in the SNA Server EHNAPPC Security dialog, it
will not cycle through all of the partner APPC LU aliases available in SNA
Server Admin.

This security dialog will appear when you start the IBM Client Access/400 Setup
applet during installation. An incomplete list may also appear in the Systems
list in the Browse Folders dialog box of the Network Connections (Folders)
applet.

NOTE: This problem has been seen with IBM CA/400 v3r1, but it does not seem to be
an issue with v3r1m1.

CAUSE
=====

In the SNA Server EHNAPPC Security dialog box, CA/400 gathers a list of all the
APPC LUs partnered with the local LU. If CA/400 reaches a Remote APPC LU on a
pending or inactive connection, it will stop at that LU.

To test what LUs are available to the client:

1. Start the SNA Server 5250 applet.

2. Click Session Configuration on the Session menu.

3. In the Session Configuration dialog box, open the Partner LU Alias list box.
   It should contain the complete list of partnered APPC LUs.

WORKAROUND
==========

In SNA Server Admin, un-partner any unavailable Remote APPC LUs. They can be
left un-partnered or re-partnered to place them at the bottom of the list. Save
the configuration and restart SNA Server service.
