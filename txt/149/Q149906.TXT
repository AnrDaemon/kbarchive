TITLE   :NetWare Server Can't Be Added to New Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you add a NetWare server to the DSMN in a Windows NT domain and later abandon
the domain, you will be barred from adding that NetWare server to a different
Windows NT domain.

CAUSE
=====

When Windows NT tries to add a NetWare server to its domain, it looks to see if
the account Winnt_Synch_Agent is already on the NetWare server. If that account
is present, you will receive the following error message:

   <servername> has already been added to a Windows NT Domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

To solve this problem, either release the NetWare server in DSMN from the
original domain or delete the Winnt_Synch_Agent account on the NetWare server.
If you delete the account, you may need to restore the bindery before you'll be
able to add the NetWare server to the new Windows NT domain. For more
information, see page 41 of the DSMN Administrator's Guide.
