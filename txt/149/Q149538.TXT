======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Server version 4.0 may perform a hardware reset every five hours for
no apparent reason. No errors are recorded in the system log.

CAUSE
=====

In rare cases, when you upgrade from Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 with
Service Pack 1 to Windows NT Server version 4.0, a registry key may become
corrupted. This does not occur if Windows NT Server version 4.0 with the
slipstreamed version of Service Pack 1 was used to perform the upgrade.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
