-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changes to command button positions made in a class based on CommandGroup are
not inherited properly in forms containing that class.

WORKAROUND
==========

Delete the instance of the class from the forms where it is contained.
Reinstantiate the class on the form. The changes in command button positions
will be displayed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a new project in Visual FoxPro called "Test" (without the quotation
   marks).

2. With the Test project maximized, click the Classes tab. Click the New button
   in the Project Manager to create a new class.

3. Enter Cmdtst as the class name. Base the class on CommandGroup, and save it
   in C:\Vfp\Repro.vcx. (This path assumes C: is the current drive and Vfp is
   the Visual FoxPro root directory. This may need to be modified to suit
   individual configurations.)

4. When the Class Designer window appears, drag the border surrounding the
   command group out enough to provide room to reposition command buttons. Save
   the class. The Repro class library should now appear in the Classes tab of
   the Test project.

5. Click the Documents tab in the Test project. With Forms highlighted, click
   the New button in the project manager to create a new form.

6. When the Form Designer window appears, make sure the Form Controls toolbar is
   visible. Click the View Classes button in the Form Controls toolbar, and
   select Add from the menu. Add C:\Vfp\Repro.vcx. The Form Controls toolbar
   should now change so that it contains the Cmdtst class. Click the Cmdtst
   class, and add it to the form.

7. Save the form as REPROTST.

8. Click the Classes tab on the Test project, and modify the Cmdtst class. When
   the Class Designer window appears, select and move one of the command buttons
   in the group to another position inside the border. Move the command button
   enough to be noticeably out of place. Save the class.

9. Click the Documents tab from the Test project, and modify the Reprotst form.
   The change in position made in the class is not inherited by the instance of
   the class on the form.
