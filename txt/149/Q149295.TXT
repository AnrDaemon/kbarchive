TITLE   :Win 95 SNA Client May Hang on Startup with Anti-cmos Virus
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.1,2.11,3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Infection by the anti-cmos virus can cause the Microsoft Windows 95 SNA client
to hang or return the following error message:

   No SNA server found in domain.

CAUSE
=====

You will get the above error when you start the SNA Server Windows 95 client
SNABASE process when it is configured for named pipes over the NetBEUI transport
only, though may occur over other named pipes transports.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the virus from the client computer to resolve this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SNA Server client internal traces and network captures show two behaviors
when you use named pipes over NetBEUI.

 - The client makes an IPC$ connection to the SNA Server; it posts a Server
   Message Block (SMB) Read Request, and then hangs.

 - If the Local Domain option is selected, the SNA client repeats the mailslot
   broadcast, but does not appear to see the SNA Server's response.

The client's other network connections are unaffected. The anti-cmos virus is a
boot sector virus. Because of the nature of viruses, it is not possible to know
with any accuracy what part of the system this virus affects or the true
identity of the virus.

It has also been reported that the FORM_A virus may cause the same results as
listed above. In each case, running a virus program will resolve the problem.
