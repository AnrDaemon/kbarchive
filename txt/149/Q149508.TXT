TITLE   :PRB: SETTEXTPOSITION() Does Not Scroll Window to New Location
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortran

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the SETTEXTPOSITION() graphics subroutine to move the cursor to a new
location outside the current client view area in a QuickWin program does not
cause the client view area to move to this new location, so it is not made
visible.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the following sample code, the call to the SETTEXTPOSITION() subroutine moves
the cursor to a location outside of the current client view, but the window is
not scrolled to the new location. Consequently the cursor is not visible, and
the user cannot see the text specified in the call to OUTTEXT.

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile options needed: /MW

         include 'flib.fi'
         include 'fgraph.fi'

         implicit none

         include 'flib.fd'
         include 'fgraph.fd'

         integer*2 i
         record /rccoord/ rc

         print *,"Please size the child window so that the last line"
         print *,"   is not visible, then press a key..."
         i=incharqq()
         call settextposition(30,1,rc)
         call outtext('Enter an integer*2 value : ')
         read (*,*) i

         end
