-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A form containing a bound Data Control disables the Validate event when the form
is unloaded.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this issue and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are steps to reproduce this behavior. The Cancel property is set
to true in the Unload event of the form to prevent the form from unloading. When
you edit a record and then unload the form, the validate event, containing a
beep instruction, executes only one more time.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start 16-bit or 32-bit Visual Basic 4.0, or if it is already running, click
   New Project on the File menu.

2. Add the following controls and set the following properties:

      Control              Default Name   Property              Value
      --------------------------------------------------------------------

      Data Control            Data1       Database Name         BIBLIO.MDB
                                          RecordSource          Authors

      TextBox Control         Text1       DataSource            Data1
                                          DataField             Author

      Command Button          Command1

3. Copy the following code to the Code window of the Form1 form:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Unload Me
         End Sub

         Private Sub Data1_Validate(Action As Integer, Save As Integer)
            Beep
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
            'The next line stops the form from being unloaded
            Cancel = True
         End Sub

4. On the Run menu, click Start or press the F5 key to start the program. Scroll
   through the records and click the command button. Note that a beep occurs
   with each action.

5. Edit a record and click the command button. Scroll through the records and
   note the a beep occurs only once. Scrolling through the records or clicking
   the command button does not execute the Validate event.
