SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a new Microsoft Exchange profile, the The Microsoft Network
Online Service information service may not be an option. Or, the Remote Mail
command on the Tools menu may be unavailable in Microsoft Exchange.

   file is missing or damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method:

Method 1

NOTE: If the MSN 2.0 CD-ROM is available, run the Msn13.exe file from the CD-ROM
to install the Moscfg32.dll, Mosabp32.dll, and Mosrxp32.dll files to their
correct locations. Extraction of the files is not necessary.

If the MSN 2.0 CD-ROM is unavailable, extract a new copy of the Moscfg32.dll,
Mosabp32.dll, and Mosrxp32.dll files from your original Windows 95 CD-ROM or
disks. to do so, follow these steps:

1. If the Moscfg32.dll, Mosabp32.dll, or Mosrxp32.dll files exist in the
   Windows\System folder, rename them so they have an .xxx extension.

2. Extract a new copy of the Moscfg32.dll, Mosabp32.dll, and Mosrxp32.dll files
   from your original Windows 95 CD-ROM or disks to the Windows\ System folder.
   These files are located in the Win95_07.cab cabinet file on the Windows 95
   CD-ROM or disk 7 of the floppy disk set.

   For information about using the Extract tool, type "extract" (without
   quotation marks) at a command prompt, or see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
