TITLE   :XADM: Setup Cannot Connect To Remote Directory Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program and add a Microsoft
Exchange Server to an existing Site with Netbeui as the only protocol running on
the computer, the Setup program will end abnormally with the following error
message:

   Error:

   A connection could not be made to the remote directory service, possibly due
   to network failure. Be sure that both directory services are running and that
   your network is available, and then try connecting again."

RESOLUTION
==========

Install either the IPX/SPX or TCP/IP protocols on the Windows NT Server. Netbeui
is not supported for Microsoft Exchange Server to Server communications. A
network protocol that supports RPC is required for the Microsoft Exchange
services to communicate with each other.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information, please check section 1.1 of the Readme.wri file on the
Microsoft Exchange Server CD.
