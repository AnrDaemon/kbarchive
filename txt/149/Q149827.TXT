Additional Installation Information
-----------------------------------

World of Nature version 1.2:

Your Explorapedia disk includes two versions of Explorapedia:

 - A 16-bit version for Windows 3.x

 - A 32-bit version for Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 3.51 and later.

Setup automatically installs the appropriate Explorapedia software for your
operating system. The version of the software for Windows 95/98 and Windows NT
is most appropriate for those operating systems. If you upgrade your Windows 3.x
operating system to Windows 95/98 or Windows NT, you should run Explorapedia
Setup again to install the 32-bit version of the software.
