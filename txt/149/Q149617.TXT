The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are browsing a page on the Word Wide Web with Microsoft Internet
Explorer, clicking an e-mail address may cause the Eudora Internet mail client
to be started instead of Microsoft Exchange.

CAUSE
=====

When you install Eudora, the registry is modified so that Eudora is called to
handle mail requests from Internet Explorer instead of Microsoft Exchange.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)before you
edit the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

Eudora updates the registry when it is installed and each time it runs. You must
restore the registry settings after running Eudora every time you run Eudora. To
do so, follow these steps:

1. Modify the following registry key

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\mailto\shell\open\command

   by changing the (Default) value to:

   rundll32.exe url.dll,MailToProtocolHandler %1

2. In Registry Editor, navigate to the following key:

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\mailto\shell\open\command

3. On the Registry menu, click Export Registry File.

4. Type a name for the registry file, and then click Save. This creates a file
   on the desktop.

5. Double-click the file you created in step 4 after you run Eudora to restore
   the registry settings.
