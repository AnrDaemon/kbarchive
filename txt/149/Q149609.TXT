-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to search for duplicate character strings by
using macro substitution to examine each field of each record. When found, the
duplicate character string, the field name containing the string, and the
corresponding record number are displayed on the FoxPro desktop. This code can
be modified to search for as many character strings as needed.

================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a free table called Names that contains six fields of Character type
   with a width of 10. Name the fields field1, field2, field3, field4, field5,
   and field6.

2. Load 10 records. Populate some fields with the name SMITH and the rest with
   names of your choice. Make certain that in some records SMITH appears in more
   than one field.

3. Create a program and insert the following code:

      CLOSE DATABASES
      CLEAR
      USE names
      SCAN                            && Search through each record
        FOR i = 1 TO FCOUNT()         &&Search through each field
            x = FIELD(i)              && Assign the field name to a variable
            IF UPPER(&;x) = "SMITH"
              ? &x + "   " + FIELD(i) + "   " + "Record # " ;
                 + LTRIM(STR(RECNO()))
            ENDIF                     && Insert needed IF ENDIF statements
            NEXT i
        ENDFOR
      ENDSCAN

4. Run the program, and notice that the information that is displayed on the
   FoxPro desktop.
