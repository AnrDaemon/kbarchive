TITLE   :XADM: Information Store Fails To Start With 1011 Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Information Store service fails to start and Event 2048
or 1087 is reported in the application log, along with one or more of the
following error messages:

   Unable to start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store. Error 0x3f3.

   -or-

   The Information Store was restored from an off-line backup. Run ISINTEG
   -PATCH before restarting the Information Store.

   -or-

   Windows could not start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store on Local
   Computer. For more information, review the System Event Log. If this is a
   non-Microsoft service, contact the service vendor, and refer to
   service-specific error code 1011.

   -or-

   The Microsoft Exchange Information Store service could not be started. A
   service specific error occurred: 1011.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) used by the
restored information store are old, and matching GUIDs may already exist. The
GUIDs for this restored information store need to be replaced to ensure that
they are unique.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is by design. You need to patch the information store to replace the GUIDs
used by the restored information store by running Isinteg - patch. Isinteg in
patch mode will run against the entire Information Store (both the Pub.edb and
Priv.edb files). It will generate new GUIDs and also patch replication
information to prevent incorrect backfilling.

To run Isinteg -patch:

1. Ensure that the Directory and System Attendant Services are running. If
   either of these services are not running, Isinteg will fail with a
   DS_COMMUNICATIONS_ERROR message.

2. Change to the Exchsrvr\Bin directory, and type Isinteg -patch. The GUIDs will
   be replaced, and Isinteg will report that the Information Store has been
   updated successfully.

3. Restart the Information Store service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT Backup utility will automatically patch the Information Store
when it is restored from an online backup only. If the Information Store is
restored from an offline Windows NT Backup, you must run Isinteg.exe.

Isinteg.exe run in patch mode performs no integrity checks of the database. To
check database integrity, please see pages 617 and 618 of the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator's Guide. Running Isinteg.exe with no parameters will print a help
screen describing command line switches and syntax.
