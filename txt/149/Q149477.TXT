TITLE   :BUG: Run-Time Error F6511 - Variable Name Not Found
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode kbFortranPS kbLangFortran

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When reading a file using namelist directed input, you may get the following
error:

   run-time error F6511
   - variable name not found

CAUSE
=====

The file wasn't opened with the DELIM="{QUOTE|APOSTROPHE}" option in the Fortran
OPEN statement used to open the file for writing.

Microsoft Fortran PowerStation 4.0 requires the DELIM="{QUOTE|APOSTROPHE}" option
if you are opening a file that is to be written with delimiters. However, when
opening and using the file for a namelist directed I/O operation, the DELIM=
option is not needed. Previous versions of Fortran did not include this option
and character variables were always written with delimiting apostrophe's.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Sample Code to Illustrate Problem and Workaround
------------------------------------------------

   ! Compile options needed: none

         PROGRAM ChangeInBehavior

         CHARACTER*20 CHA
         INTEGER IA
         REAL RA

         DATA CHA /'Character A'/ 
         DATA IA /1000/ 
         DATA RA /100.0/ 

         NAMELIST /TheNameList/ CHA,IA,RA

   !     Uncomment the following line to get proper behavior
   !      OPEN(UNIT=1,FILE='TEMP.DAT',STATUS='UNKNOWN',DELIM='APOSTROPHE')

   !     Comment out the following line to get proper behavior
         OPEN( UNIT=1, FILE='TEMP.DAT', STATUS='UNKNOWN')

         WRITE ( 1, TheNameList )
         CLOSE( 1 )

         OPEN( UNIT=1, FILE='TEMP.DAT', STATUS='UNKNOWN' )

         READ( 1, TheNameList )
         CLOSE ( 1 )

         WRITE ( *, TheNameList )

         END
