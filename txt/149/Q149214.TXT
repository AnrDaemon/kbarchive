TITLE   :Windows NT Server Stops Responding To Macintosh Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Macintosh computers may temporarily stop responding when you access information
from a Windows NT Server that is running Services for Macintosh (SFM). If the
double network arrows displayed in the upper left corner no longer flash, this
may indicate that the Macintosh client is trying to access the Windows NT
Server. The Macintosh client will usually start communicating within 30 to 40
seconds. This has only occurred in production servers with large Macintosh
volumes, (for example, more than 5 GB and more than 100 Macintosh clients). When
you run large programs and files off the server, these same symptoms may appear
due to the bandwidth required to carry the information across the network.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT Server rebuilds an index related to each of the Macintosh volumes,
based on the number of changes to the volume (usually 1,000 changes),or the time
since the previous re-index (usually 10 minutes). This process may take up to a
minute to accomplish, depending on the size of the database, and is directly
dependent on the number of files and directories in the volume. During this
operation,a request from a Macintosh client is put on hold; this causes the
Windows NT Server to appear to stop responding.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
