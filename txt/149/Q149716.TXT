TITLE   :New Hardware Is Added to All Hardware Profiles
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you add new hardware on a docking station with the Add New Hardware
Wizard, Windows 95 may become unstable or generate hardware-oriented error
messages when the computer is undocked.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Windows 95 has installed the new hardware in all
configurations (both docked and undocked).

RESOLUTION
==========

Use either method:

 - If the hardware was added in the docked state and the hardware is not present
   in the undocked state, remove the device in Device Manager. If the hardware
   was added in the undocked state, remove the device from the docked
   configuration.

   NOTE: Disabling the device in the unwanted configuration in Device Manager may
   not resolve the conflicts. Be sure to click the missing device and click
   Remove, and then confirm which hardware profile you want to modify.

 - Boot the computer in the docked configuration first. Run the Add New Hardware
   Wizard, and allow it to detect the devices. Then, boot in the undocked
   configuration, and run the Add New Hardware Wizard again.

   Windows 95 will detect that the device is not present in the alternate
   configuration and prompt you to remove the device from that configuration.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
