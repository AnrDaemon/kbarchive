TITLE   :Mac Srv: Name of Mail Server Does Not Appear in Chooser
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On an AppleTalk network with more than one AppleTalk zone, the Mail server may
be visible in the Chooser on some workstations, but not on others.

CAUSE
=====

There may be a problem on the AppleTalk network or there may be a problem with
the workstation itself. The names shown by the Chooser are found by the Chooser
software, not Mail software.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the network router or bridge, INITs (extensions), network card, System,
and so forth.

From the server machine, check if you can see the name of the server in the
Chooser. If you can see the name on the server machine itself, the server is
operating correctly.

Names of Mail servers, AppleShare servers, network printers and other network
devices are stored by each router on the network. Programs can query the
network/router to gain information about the status of the network.

Additional query words: 2.00 3.00 3.10
