The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, at six-month intervals, Schedule+ in Windows for Workgroups 3.1
displays a message asking if you want to archive and delete old appointment
information. The message reads as follows:

   There is information stored in your schedule file which is older than the
   limit set for discarding data. Would you like to delete it?

There is no way to disable this message. The message continues to display at the
start of Schedule+ until you archive and delete the old information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The full retail version of Schedule+ has an administrator utility that allows
variable time periods for archiving old appointment information.

After you archive the Schedule+ data, the data doesn't appear in Schedule+
anymore. However, you can access this data by selecting the File menu option,
then selecting Open Archive, and then opening the correct archived data file.

Additional query words: 3.10 schedule plus error 6 3.11
