TITLE   :FIX: Data Access Setup Can Give Incorrect Error Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbIISAMkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When adding an SQL server with the Microsoft ODBC Setup program, you may receive
the following incorrect message when the server name is actually correct:

   The server <your server name> was not found on the network. Are you
   sure you want to use it?

CAUSE
=====

The cause of this problem has not yet been determined. We are researching it.


WORKAROUND
==========

Although Visual Basic Data Access Setup generates this incorrect message, Visual
Basic still adds the correct information to the ODBC.INI file and the ODBC
driver is set up correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in Visual Basic
version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Run the Data Access Setup program.

2. Select SQL Server in the Install Drivers dialog box. Then click the OK
   button. If the ODBC drivers were installed previously, you will get a message
   box that asks if you want to replace your driver; choose Yes.

3. Select the Add option in the Data Sources dialog box.

4. Select SQL Server in the Add Data Source dialog box, and click the OK button.

5. In the ODBC SQL Server Setup dialog box, type the name of the data source in
   the Data Source Name field and a valid SQL server name in the Server field.

6. Click the OK button. At this point, Visual Basic may generate a message box
   with the following text

   The server <your server name> was not found on the network. Are you
   sure you want to use it?

7. Click the Yes button, and the setup will continue as usual.
