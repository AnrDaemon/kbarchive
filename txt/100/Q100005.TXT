TITLE   :Drive Letters Unavailable for Interlnk with MS-DOS 6.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you use Interlnk with MS-DOS, certain drives may be unavailable on the client
machine. To make all drives available for use with Interlnk, place the DEVICE
line for INTERLNK.EXE at the end of your CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When INTERLNK.EXE loads from the CONFIG.SYS file, it redirects the next
available drive letter on the client machine to the drives on the server
machine.

For example, if the device driver for INTERLNK.EXE is loaded before the device
driver DBLSPACE.SYS in the CONFIG.SYS file, the drive letter for the compressed
or host drive may not be accessible on the client machine. Therefore, the device
driver line for INTERLNK.EXE should appear after all other block device drivers
and reside at the end of the CONFIG.SYS file.

When you change the location of the INTERLNK.EXE command in your CONFIG.SYS file,
you may cause your DoubleSpace host drive letter to change. If you are using
Windows (and a permanent swap file [PSF]) and the host drive letter changes, you
receive a corrupt swap file error.

For more information on re-creating your PSF, query on the following words in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   " doublespace and psf and corrupt " (without the quotation marks)

For more information on how DoubleSpace assigns drive letters, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   " order and assigns and drive and letters " (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and
filenames.

Additional query words: letter config 6.00 6.20 last double space interlink dblspace
