The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5

You can change the size and name of the font used by Program Manager for
icon titles. To do so, go to one of the following Registry subkeys:

   HKEY_USERS\Default\Control Panel\Desktop HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control
   Panel\Desktop

Change the following two values

   IconTitleSize IconTitleFaceName

to the size and name (respectively) of the font you want. For example,
the default values are:

   IconTitleSize : REG_SZ : 9 IconTitleFaceName : REG_SZ : Helv

The value

   IconTitleStyle

which can currently be implemented in Windows 3.1 to change the Program
Manager font to bold, cannot be used to change the font in Windows NT 3.1.
While the value is documented, changing it from the default of "0" to "1"
in the Registry does not work. However, in Windows NT 3.5 this entry works
as expected.
