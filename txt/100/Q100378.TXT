SYMPTOMS
========

In the products listed at the top of this article, you receive the following
error message:

   

   Multimedia Viewer MCI

   Filename extension of the specified multimedia file
   is not associated with any installed device.
   file: <filename of file>

This occurs if any of the following lines are missing from the [MCI extensions]
section of the WIN.INI file and that Application accesses a file with that
extension:

mid=sequencer
wav=waveaudio
MMM=MMMovie
AVI=AVIVideo

RESOLUTION
==========

If any of the above lines are missing, you need to add them. If any of the lines
has a semi-colon as the first character, you need to remove the semi- colon.

For more information about editing the Windows initialization (.ini) files see
your Windows documentation or online help.

NOTE: The semi-colon at the front of the line has the effect of remarking out
that line so that it is not read by Windows.
