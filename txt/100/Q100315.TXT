The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

The following steps are performed by the Emergency Repair Disk:

1. Runs CHKDSK on the partition containing Windows NT system files. On Intel x86
   machines, also runs CHKDSK on the system partition (this is optional and must
   be enabled manually).

2. Verifies that each file in the installation is good, through a checksum
   algorithm. If files are missing or corrupt they are restored from the
   installation disks.

3. Replaces the default system and security (SAM) Registry hives, subject to
   user confirmation.

4. Reinstalls Boot Loader (that is, the boot sector, BOOT.INI, NTLDR, etc.)

Note: The Emergency Repair disk is machine specific, and should only
be used on a system on which it was created.
