-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Redirecting the output of a wide directory list to a parallel port connected
over a network using Windows for Workgroups 3.1 may not list the contents of the
directory. For example, the following format results in listing only the
directory header and footer

   DIR /W > LPTx

where "x" ranges from 1 to 9.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1.
