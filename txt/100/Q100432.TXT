The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the command LABEL FORMAT c:\foxprow\test.lbx SAMPLE is used with FoxPro for
Windows, the keyword SAMPLE has no effect and the samples are not displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because SAMPLE can be only used to test label alignment in
character-based labels created in FoxPro for MS-DOS.
