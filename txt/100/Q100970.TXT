======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Distribution Kit, version 1.1 
 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

This article describes how to distribute a secure application with the Microsoft
Access Distribution Kit or Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit and still give
your users the ability to change their passwords.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To achieve this functionality, do the following:

1. Make the Database window active so that you can access the Security menu.
   (The best method for this is to select an object in the Database window
   through a macro).

2. From the Security menu, choose Password. The user then changes the password.

3. Once the user has closed the Password dialog box, set the focus back to the
   form that you called the macro or function from.

   Here is a sample macro:

         Macro Name         Actions
         -------------------------------
         Change Password    SelectObject
                            DoMenuItem
                            SelectObject

         Change Password Actions
         ----------------------------
         SelectObject
             Object Type: Macro
             Object Name: Autoexec
             In Database window: Yes
         DoMenuItem
             Menu Bar: Database
             Menu Name: Security
             Command: Change Password
             Subcommand:
         SelectObject
             Object Type: Form
             Object Name: Form1
             In Database window: No

The Database window appears, as well as the dialog box to change the password.
You cannot select anything in the Database window because the Change Password
dialog box is modal.

In the Microsoft Access Distribution Kit or Developer's Toolkit, the
functionality is identical except that the Database window is not displayed.
