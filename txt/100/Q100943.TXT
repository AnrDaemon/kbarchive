SUMMARY
=======

If you want to always print to the same file in Microsoft Windows or Microsoft
Windows for Workgroups, you can place an entry for that particular filename in
the [Ports] section of the WIN.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The new entry appears in the Printer Setup dialog box of Windows-based
applications or in the Connect dialog box of Control Panel. The following is an
example of the [Ports] section of the WIN.INI file:

      [Ports]
      ; A line with [filename].PRN followed by an equal sign causes
      ; [filename] to appear in the Control Panel's Printer Configuration
      ; box. Printers connected to [filename] direct output to this file.
      LPT1:=
      COM1:=2400,n,8,1,x
      EPT:=
      FILE:=
      LPT1.DOS=
      LPT2.DOS=
      C:\MY.TXT=

The example above includes the new entry for the filename MY.TXT at the root
directory of drive C.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 every time
