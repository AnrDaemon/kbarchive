-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

When you install MS-DOS on a computer running Windows 3.1, MS-DOS Upgrade Setup
modifies Windows File Manager to include a Tools menu and an Undelete command,
even if you did not choose to install the optional MS-DOS utilities (Backup,
Undelete, and Anti-Virus). Microsoft Windows for Workgroups users also have four
tool icons added to the File Manager toolbar.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MS-DOS Upgrade Setup offers the option to install the Windows and MS-DOS
versions of the Microsoft Backup, Undelete, and Anti-Virus utilities. Regardless
of which option you select (Windows only, MS-DOS only, Windows and MS-DOS, or
None), MS-DOS 6 Setup installs the MSTOOLS.DLL file and modifies Windows File
Manager. Setup creates a Tools menu containing the Backup, Anti-Virus, and
DoubleSpace Info commands and adds the Undelete command to the File menu.

If you choose a menu item or a tool for an optional utility that has not been
installed, you receive a "Cannot Run File" error message stating the utility was
not found in the MS-DOS directory. This error message also explains that to
install the utility, you should run SETUP /E from the MS-DOS command prompt.
