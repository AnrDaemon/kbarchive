The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Schedule Distribution (SCHDIST.EXE) among several Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks postoffices from version 1.0 of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows,
the free and busy times from one or more postoffices will not transmit or be
received by one or more postoffices.

One or more postoffices participating in Schedule Distribution will never receive
updates from other postoffices. For example, the following log file indicates
that a message from RB/SMPO2 is generated; however, the line immediately
following indicates a message received, but without a "From:" line.

   [16:07:41] - <m:> RB/SMPO: Checking for schedule updates ...
   [16:07:41] - Sending schedule update
   [16:07:41] -          From: RB/SMPO
   [16:07:41] -            To: RB/SMPO2
   [16:07:41] -
   [16:07:41] - <n:> RB/SMPO2: Checking for schedule updates ...
   [16:07:42] - Sending schedule update
   [16:07:42] -          From: RB/SMPO2
   [16:07:42] -            To: RB/SMPO
   [16:07:42] - Received schedule update
   [16:07:42] -            To: RB/SMPO2
   [16:07:42] -

CAUSE
=====

When multiple postoffices have similar network and postoffice names, the
Schedule Distribution program does not fully validate the entire
Network/Postoffice/Mailbox name address to which the Free/Busy times are
addressed. In the example above, RB/SMPO2 actually picks up the message meant
for RB/SMPO and processes it without indicating an error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, change either the network name or the postoffice name.
For example, if you rename RB/SMPO to RB/SMPO1, Schedule Distribution will
work.

NOTE: This problem will also affect a mail user's Personal Address Book (PAB)
making the old addresses (before the name/network change) invalid.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 1.0 and 1.0a of
Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows. This problem was corrected in SCHDIST.EXE
version 1.0a.2. If you do not have version 1.0a.2 (or later), a self-extracting
file is available for download.
