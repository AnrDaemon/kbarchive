TITLE   :Error 2 Stops OTN Installation of DCA Token Ring Adapters
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

When performing an over-the-network (OTN) installation for LAN Manager on an
MS-DOS workstation using DCA's token ring adapter (IRMATRAC), the installation
copies all files from the server onto the MS-DOS workstation, then displays this
error message:

   An error occurred while reading the file: PROTOCOL.INI
   Error Code:2

CAUSE
=====

There is an error in the [IRMATR] section in NSETUP.INF file on server
(LANMAN\NINSTALL). The NSETUP.INF file contains information for finding the
adapter driver (IRMATR.DOS) and the PROTOCOL.INI, but its PROTOCOL.INI path in
section [IRMATR] is defined: RIVERS\TOKENTNG\IRMATRAC\PROTOCOL.INI. The
"TOKENTNG" should be TOKENRNG.

"Error Code:2" is an extended error message number that means "file not found."
These errors are listed in the "MS-DOS Programmer's Reference."

RESOLUTION
==========

Correct the PROTOCOL.INI path in NSETUP.INF, then perform the OTN installation
again.
