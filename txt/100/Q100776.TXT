======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to use the header files provided with the Microsoft Windows NT
Pre-Release Development Kit (PDK) in Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, can cause
problems ranging from incorrect results to General Protection Faults(GPF).

CAUSE
=====

Several data structures changed between the Windows NT Pre-Release and the code
that Visual C++, 32-bit Edition supports. Most of the changes converted data
from type short to type int or from type unsigned short to type unsigned int.
Code developed with the PDK header files passes incorrectly sized items to the
functions in the C run-time library.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that the version of the header files used to build your application match
the version of the library.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine which directories are in the compiler search path for files and
libraries, type "SET" (without quotation marks) at the Windows NT system prompt
or choose the System icon in Control Panel.
