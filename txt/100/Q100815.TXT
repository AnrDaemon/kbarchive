======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

FoxCentral's default directory setting does not affect the FoxBASE+ default
directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FoxBASE+/LAN interacts differently with FoxCentral than the single-user product
does. When FoxCentral is called from the LAN version, a dialog box asks for a
default drive and directory. This drive and directory is where FoxCentral's work
files (CENTRAL.ADX and CENTRAL.DBM) will be located. This location has no
bearing on the default drive and directory specified for FoxBASE+. The default
drive and directory for FoxBASE+ are specified through FoxCentral's menu.

Additional query words: 2.10
