======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In CodeView for Windows, the single screen mode may display one or more "a"
characters. The "a" will appear in the title bar, the status bar, or both. This
does not affect any of the functionality of CodeView.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a problem in the currently set OEM font, and is not
specifically related to CodeView.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, modify or add an OEMFONTS.FON line in the [boot]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file. The OEMFONTS.FON line should point to one of the
OEM fonts provided with the C/C++ compiler (either OEM10.FON or OEM08.FON from
the BIN directory). For example, the line would appear as follows if you install
Visual C++ in the default C:\MSVC directory:

   OEMFONTS.FON=C:\MSVC\BIN\OEM10.FON

MORE INFORMATION
================

Changing the OEM font used will probably change the size of the CodeView window
on the screen.

Additional query words: 4.00
