======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing a ? print command with a FONT clause sometimes prints the text double
spaced.

CAUSE
=====

The screen font or print font is smaller than the font used by the question mark
command.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure the screen font or the print font is the same as the font used in the
question mark command. You can change the print font by issuing the SET PRINT
FONT command. Actually if you set the screen or printer font ahead of time,
there is no need to use the font clause on the question mark command unless you
wish to change fonts briefly.

In FoxPro for Windows 2.6 the screen font can be changed by issuing the following
command:

   MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN FONT "ARIAL", 10

In Visual FoxPro the screen font can be changed by issuing the following
command:

   _SCREEN.FONTNAME="ARIAL"
   _SCREEN.FONTSIZE=10

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FoxPro 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, and 2.6
for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Issue the following commands:

      MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN FONT "ARIAL", 8    && FoxPro 2.6

   -or-

      _SCREEN.FONTNAME="ARIAL"                && Visual FoxPro
      _SCREEN.FONTSIZE=8

      ? "Hello there?"
      ? "Hello there?"

   These commands cause the text to be displayed single spaced, with one line of
   text directly on top of the next.

2. Issue the following commands:

      ? "Hello there?" FONT "arial",10
      ? "Hello there?" FONT "arial",10

   The text appears double spaced with one full blank line between each line.
   This phenomenon occurs both on screen and in printed output.
