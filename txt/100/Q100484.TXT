The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SoundBits (all collections), version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you launch SND.CPL (the Sound dialog box included with SoundBits 1.0) and
then switch back to Windows, you may receive a general protection (GP) fault
that hangs Windows. This problem only occurs if at least one session of SND.CPL
is already running (it only occurs with second or subsequent sessions).

This problem does not occur while using the original Windows 3.1 Sound dialog
box. You are using the original Windows 3.1 Sound dialog if the SND.CPL file on
your system is dated 03/10/92 and has a size of 8,192 bytes.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SoundBits version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Run File Manager.

2. From the File menu, choose Run.

3. In the Command Line field, type the following

   "CONTROL SND.CPL" (without the quotation marks)

   and choose OK. The Sound dialog box should now appear.

4. Leave the Sound option running and switch back to File Manager by pressing
   ALT+TAB.

5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until Windows crashes.

Many applications use this method of starting the Sound dialog box. By running a
few applications or utilities that run the Sound dialog box, you may
inadvertently cause Windows to crash. For example, this behavior occurs when
running applications such as the Windows Clock and Minesweeper.
