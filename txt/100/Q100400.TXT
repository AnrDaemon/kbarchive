SUMMARY
=======

When you switch away from Musical Instruments, any open pop-up windows will
disappear. For example, if you have a pop-up window on the screen and then
choose the Finder, the pop-up window disappears. The pop-up window does not
reappear when you click on Musical Instruments again.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Musical Instruments for the
Macintosh, version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
