SUMMARY
=======

The Hewlett-Packard (HP) OmniBook 300 contains DBLSPACE.EXE, which is taken from
MS-DOS 6.0. The OmniBook implementation of DoubleSpace sets the uncompressed
drive letter to drive E. Hewlett-Packard set drive E as the default; this
default does not adhere to the MS-DOS 6.0 standard for setting DoubleSpace
drives.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Hewlett-Packard chose this default to coordinate with internal OmniBook
configurations, such as the use of Stacker on the Flash RAM. Note that the
Stacker functions provided with the OmniBook 300 on Flash RAM always use drive F
as the default for the uncompressed drive.
