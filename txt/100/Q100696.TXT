The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Flight Simulator 5.0 is backward compatible with some features of Flight
Simulator 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. The Flight Simulator 4.0 default scenery, Aircraft and Scenery Designer .SC1
   files and Sublogic/Mallard scenery files in .SCN format are compatible with
   version 5.0.

2. You can use the Microsoft Flight Simulator Aircraft and Scenery Designer 4.0
   files in conjunction with the Flight Simulator 4.0 database, but these files
   will not work with the Flight Simulator 5.0 scenery database. In other words,
   you will be looking at Flight Simulator 4.0 scenery in Flight Simulator 5.0
   if you use the Flight Simulator Aircraft and Scenery Designer 4.0 files.

3. Old "Mode" and "Demo" files are supported (MOD and VID files).

4. Microsoft Flight Simulator Aircraft and Scenery Designer will be updated to
   take advantages of Flight Simulator 5.0 features.

As we receive more information, this article will be updated.
