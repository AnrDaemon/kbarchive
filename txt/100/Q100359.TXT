SUMMARY
=======

The description of the ExitWindows function does not list the code that you can
use to terminate Windows and return control to MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 290 of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) "Programming
Reference, Volume 2: Functions" manual for version 3.1 states that the
ExitWindows function can be used to terminate Windows and return control to
MS-DOS. However, the description doesn't list the code needed to exercise this
feature of the ExitWindows function.

To allow the ExitWindows function to terminate Windows and return control to
MS-DOS, pass a zero as the dwReturnCode parameter.
