-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) or Dell system and you use the
BIOS option to logically swap drives A and B, Microsoft Backup and Microsoft
Backup for Windows cannot back up or restore files to those drives.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Microsoft Backup reads from the floppy disk drive
through BIOS disk services but writes to the floppy disk drive directly through
the I/O ports.

Microsoft Backup can work successfully with logically swapped floppy disk drives
that are implemented by physically exchanging the hardware signals.

WORKAROUND
==========

You may be able to work around this situation by using MS-DOS Path as your
backup destination.
