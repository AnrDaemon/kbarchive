-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk networks, the workstation
software may display the following status dialog box during login:

   Reading Resources from Server

While this message is displayed, the workstation downloads into the MS Mail Cache
file all resources necessary to work offline. These resources include:

 - The All list

 - All message forms

 - All one-off addressing screens

 - Contents of the Personal Address Book

 - Personal Group definitions

The offline preference is enabled by default. If you do not need offline
operation, you can prevent the information from being downloaded by disabling
the offline preference. You can do this while you are logged into the user
account.

To ensure the offline information is kept up to date, the workstation downloads
the information from the server. The frequency of the download depends on the
preference setting for the workstation. The default is seven days.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may encounter the Reading Resources message more frequently than the
specified download time in the Preferences section. The workstation keeps a
version number of the Personal Address Book (PAB). This version number matches
the information stored on the local workstation with the information stored on
the server to ensure synchronization.

Updates of the PAB are not controlled by the Preferences setting. If the user
allows all message recipients to be added to the PAB, this may cause frequent
updates to the PAB. The next time the user logs into the server, the PAB version
numbers will be compared and if they are different, the address book is
downloaded. To minimize the download of resources, you should not automatically
add users to the address book.

A corrupt MS Mail Cache may also repeatedly download the resources from the
server. You can create a new cache by removing the cache file and restarting the
computer. The next time the user signs in to the mail server, the resources will
be fully read one time. After they are fully read, download will only occur
based on the download preference or when the PAB has been updated.
