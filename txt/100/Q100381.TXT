The Character Map program included with Windows and Windows for Workgroups
provides you with extended characters and special characters that you can insert
into other Windows-based applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Characters from Character Map can be inserted into an application by following
the steps listed in Help under the subject "Inserting a character into a
document." You can also do this is by pressing the key(s) displayed in the
bottom-right corner of the the status bar of Character Map. Numeric keys must be
typed on the numeric keypad.

You can use the following steps to insert special characters into a Windows-based

2. Select the same font that you selected in Character Map.

3. Position the cursor where you want the characters to appear.

4. Press the key(s) listed next to "Keystroke:" in the status bar.

NOTE: The above steps do not work if the CTRL key is part of the sequence.

Printed results may differ depending on the font you use and the printer and
video drivers installed.
