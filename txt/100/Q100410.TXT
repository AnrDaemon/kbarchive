TITLE   :Defrag: Error Writing Cluster nnn,nnn in CVF (But CVF Is OK)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Microsoft Defragmenter (Defrag) and your DoubleSpace compressed
volume file (CVF) is full or nearly full, Defrag reports the following:

   Error writing cluster nnn,nnn

   Use a disk repair program to fix, and then run DEFRAG again.

CAUSE
=====

If CHKDSK shows no problems and a surface scan utility, such as Symantec's
Norton Utilities Norton Disk Doctor (NDD.EXE), shows no problems, the error
message is occurring because Defrag is unable to write the information that it
has read. Defrag is trying to copy a cluster before moving it, but since the
DoubleSpace-compressed drive is too fragmented or full, there is no space large
enough to write the cluster.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Increase the size of your DoubleSpace-compressed drive and then run Defrag.

-or-

 - Delete enough files to allow Defrag to run.
