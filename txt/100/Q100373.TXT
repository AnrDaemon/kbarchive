======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

Central Point Software (CPS) BootSafe reports the following error message after
you install MS-DOS 6 or 6.2, or when you resize your DoubleSpace- compressed
drive:

   W A R N I N G

   Partition / Boot Sector was Modified

CAUSE
=====

This situation occurs because the BIOS parameter block (BPB) is rewritten when
you install MS-DOS and when you resize a DoubleSpace-compressed drive.

BootSafe stores BPB information in a hidden-system file called BOOT.CPS. When
BootSafe sees the BPB has changed, it displays the above error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the situation, choose Update when you receive the warning message
from BootSafe.

MORE INFORMATION
