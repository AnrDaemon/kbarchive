TITLE   :PRB: SDK Install Makes Microsoft Tools Group Unavailable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), the Microsoft Tools
groups created by the MS-DOS 6 installation program is no longer available.

CAUSE
=====

When you install Microsoft Windows 3.1 SDK, the installation program does not
correctly handle the comments in the PROGMAN.INI file. As a result, Microsoft
Tools group is not available in Program Manager.

The Windows 3.1 SDK installation program uses an exiting group number when the
PROGMAN.INI file contains comments made by the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup program.

For example, if you have the following [Groups] section in your PROGMAN.INI file
before you install Windows 3.1 SDK

   Group1=C:\WINDOWS\MAIN.GRP
   Group2=C:\WINDOWS\ACCESSOR.GRP
   Group3=C:\WINDOWS\GAMES.GRP
   ;======== MS-DOS 6 Setup Modification - Begin ========

Group4=C:\DOS\WNTOOLS.GRP
   ;======== MS-DOS 6 Setup Modification - End ========

you have the following [Groups] section after you install the Windows 3.1 SDK:

   Group1=C:\WINDOWS\MAIN.GRP
   Group2=C:\WINDOWS\ACCESSOR.GRP
   Group3=C:\WINDOWS\GAMES.GRP
   Group4=C:\WINDEV\SDKTOOL1.GRP
   Group4=C:\DOS\WNTOOLS.GRP
   ;======== MS-DOS 6 Setup Modification - End ========

As a result, the Microsoft Tools (WNTOOLS.GRP) is not available in Program
Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, edit the PROGMAN.INI file and change the
"Group<n>=" value for the WNTOOLS.GRP line. For example, if you have
"Group4=C:\WINDEV\SDKTOOL1.GRP" and "Group4=C:\DOS\WNTOOLS.GRP", change the
second "Group4" to Group5, or another unused value.
