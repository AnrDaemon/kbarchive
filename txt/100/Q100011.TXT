SUMMARY
=======

There are several issues that need to be addressed in order to ensure smooth
interoperability between Windows NT and Windows for Workgroups. When setting up
your network, note the following three issues:

Browsemaster Conflicts
----------------------

Browsemaster contentions can occur between Windows for Workgroups workstations
and Windows NT workstations when a workgroup or domain contains at least one
machine of each type. You may have difficulty seeing servers in a Windows NT
network from a Windows for Workgroups workstation if the workstation is a backup
browsemaster and not registered in the Windows NT network. To work around this
problem, do the following:

 - Make sure there is a guest account enabled in the Windows NT domain.

-or-

 - Add the following line to the [network] section of the SYSTEM.INI files in
   all Windows for Workgroups machines on the network:

   MaintainServerList=no

   This workaround stops all Windows for Workgroups workstations from trying to
   be browsemasters. If you use this workaround, you need to ensure that at
   least one Windows NT machine (workstation or server) in the workgroup or
   domain is running at all times. Until a Windows NT machine is running or a
   user changes the value of the MaintainServerList variable to "auto" and
   reboots, no browsing can occur (you receive error 6118).

   -or-

 - Log on to the domain or workgroup with a valid account (even a guest account
   works).

Guest Accounts
--------------

Guest accounts should remain enabled on domain controllers. Instead of removing
guest accounts to restrict access to certain services, simply remove any of the
undesired or all of the guest account rights in User Manager.

User Name Duplication
---------------------

There should not be user name duplicates on different domains. If a user name is
duplicated across different domains, there will be inconsistent results when a
logon is attempted from a Windows for Workgroups workstation on that Windows NT
network.
