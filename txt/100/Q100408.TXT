SUMMARY
=======

On page 568 of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)
"Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions" manual, the documentation for
LineDDA incorrectly describes the lParam parameter. The explanation for lParam
reads:

   lParam

      Points to 32 bits of application-defined data that is passed
      to the callback function.

The description of the lParam parameter should read as follows:

   lParam

      Specifies a 32-bit application-defined value that LineDDA passes
      to the callback function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An application calling LineDDA can pass more than 32 bits of data to the
callback function by allocating a buffer and passing a pointer to the buffer in
lParam.
