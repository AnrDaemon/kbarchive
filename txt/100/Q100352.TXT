TITLE   :SMTP: 550 Huh? Extended HELO (EHLO) Not Supported
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP does not accept the extended hello
greeting (EHLO). If a host contacts the SMTP gateway computer with "EHLO"
instead of "HELO," the gateway replies with a "550 Huh?" and promptly closes the
connection so the host can't send the standard "HELO."

STATUS
======

Gateway to SMTP. This problem was corrected in version 3.0.2 of SMTPGATE.EXE. If
you do not have version 3.0.2 (or later), you can obtain the latest version from
the Microsoft Software Library (MSL). Download SMTPGW.EXE (S14223), a
