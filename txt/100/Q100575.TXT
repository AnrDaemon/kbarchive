CAUSE

terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program in the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file
that does not exist on the specified path.

The second error occurs when the driver or TSR program that caused the first
error is in the CONFIG.SYS file, but does not exist, or the path is incorrect,
or the filename is spelled incorrectly.
