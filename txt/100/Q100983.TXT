SYMPTOMS
========

The original Hewlett-Packard (HP) PaintJet printer may print vertical lines
through all lines containing graphics or TrueType fonts. The printer may print
garbage characters also.

CAUSE
=====

The lines through the characters may occur if the parity for the RS-232 serial
interface is set incorrectly. The printer may print garbage characters if the
other interface settings do not match the settings in the serial interface
dialog box in Control Panel.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, check the serial interface settings in Control Panel.
The common settings for this printer are 9600 baud, no parity, 8 data bits and 1
stop bit, and XON/XOFF protocol. To set the DIP switches to match this
configuration, set them all to the OFF position. (The OFF position is marked
with an open circle on the printer.)

The DIP switches are as follows:

   DIP #     Setting         ON          OFF
