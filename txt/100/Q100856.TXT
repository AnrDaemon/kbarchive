TITLE   :Compressed Waveform Files Don't Rewind or Repeat
PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Windows Products

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you play compressed waveform (.WAV) files from Media Player 2.0 that ships
with Microsoft Video for Windows 1.0 and 1.0a, the Auto Rewind and Auto Repeat
options may not work as expected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Options dialog box in Media Player 2.0 contains a check box for Auto Repeat
and another for Auto Rewind. When active, these check boxes should cause the
playback of the current device to automatically rewind and then automatically
repeat the active file. However, certain compressed waveform files will not
rewind or repeat when these check boxes are active.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following steps require that you have the Hanna Barbara edition of Microsoft
SoundBits installed on your system:

1. Run or switch to Media Player version 2.0.

2. From the Device menu, choose Sound. The Open dialog box should appear.

3. Select BLIP.WAV from the SNDBITS/HB subdirectory and choose OK.

4. From the Edit menu, choose Options and select the Auto Rewind and Auto Repeat
   check boxes.

5. Choose the Play button. (Note that the waveform file will not repeat or
   rewind.)

This problem affects only certain compressed waveform files, but has been
reproduced in files from Microsoft's Windows Sound System and SoundBits.

Workaround
----------

If any of the file attributes are changed, the file automatically repeats and
automatically rewinds. These attributes include the file description, the
picture associated with the file, and the file label. These attributes can be
changed from Quick Recorder that ships with Windows Sound System.
