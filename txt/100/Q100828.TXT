SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail MS-DOS Message Transfer Agent (MTA) and version
3.2 of Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA employ a new file- locking mechanism to
increase the robustness of mail transmission.

This file locking mechanism creates and deletes temporary files when the MTA
polls the postoffices for mail to be delivered. The number of files created and
deleted depends on how often the MTA polls the postoffice and on the number of
MTAs servicing the postoffice. When running Mail with NetWare 3.x and later, the
number of deleted files and the frequency at which they are deleted can affect
disk storage on the file server. Because of this, Microsoft recommends that the
P1 subdirectory for each postoffice serviced by an MTA be flagged as Normal
Purge.

To flag the P1 subdirectory as Normal Purge, Microsoft recommends that you
perform this procedure on each file server where a postoffice is installed and
is being serviced by a version 3.2 MTA.

1. Log in to the file server as Supervisor, Supervisor Equivalent, or a user who
   has Access control and Modify rights to the P1 subdirectory.

2. Change directories to the subdirectory where the mail database resides.

3. Type the following to set the P1 directory for Normal Purge:

   " flagdir P1 NP" (without the quotation marks)

Deleted files in the P1 subdirectory will immediately purge from the file system
and the disk space used by these files will be available.
