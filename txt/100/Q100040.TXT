======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the updates to Messaging Application Program Interface
(MAPI) for Microsoft Visual Basic versions 2.0 and 3.0 for Windows that were
made for version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer. For an explanation
of the MAPI changes, please refer to the Electronic Forms Designer "Developer's
Guide," Chapter 11, "Simple MAPI for Visual Basic."

NOTE: The MAPI information from Electronic Forms Designer supersedes the MAPI
information in the version 3.2 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks "Technical
Reference" manual.

 - Incorporated the following information throughout Chapter 11 of the
   "Developer's Guide":

   The following two return values are documented in the "Technical Reference"
   manual, but are not used and should be ignored:

      MAPI_E_NO_RECIP
      MAPI_E_BAD_RECIP

   The following three return values are incorrectly documented in the "Technical
   Reference" manual:

      Technical Reference Uses    Header Files Use
      ----------------------------------------------------------------

      MAPI_E_USER_ABORT           MAPI_USER_ABORT
      MAPI_E_AMBIG_RECIP          MAPI_E_AMBIGUOUS_RECIPIENT
      MAPI_E_LOGON_FAILURE        MAPI_E_LOGIN_FAILURE

   Your applications should use the return value names listed in the header
   files.

   This information is in the "Technical Reference" README file and should be
   added to the "Technical Reference" manual.

 - Deleted the Originator field from the MapiMessage type (pages 198-199).

   This field is documented in the "Technical Reference" manual but it does not
   exist; if you use this field, your code will not compile.

 - Added additional information about the Subject field of MapiMessage (page
   199).

   Add the following information to the "Technical Reference" manual:

   " (Messages saved with MAPISaveMail are not limited to 256 characters.)"
   (without the quotation marks)

 - Changed the description of the RecipClass field of MapiRecip (page 200).

   Change the following description in the "Technical Reference" manual

   (Messages can be sorted by recipient class.)

   to:

   " (Recipients can be sorted by recipient class.) " (without the quotation
   marks)

 - Changed the description of the EditFields parameter of MAPIAddress (page
   202).

   Changed the Recips parameter to the Recipients() parameter throughout the
   description. Correct the "Technical Reference" manual to correctly reference
   this parameter.

 - Added a "Flags" parameter to MAPISaveMail (pages 219-220).

   Add this parameter to the MAPISaveMail function in the "Technical Reference"
   manual.
