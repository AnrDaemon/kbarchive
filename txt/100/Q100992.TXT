TITLE   :Incorrect Message Displayed When Retrieving Catalog Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you retrieve a catalog file in Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS, you are
prompted to insert the last disk of the backup set. If the catalog file is very
large, it may reside on multiple disks and the following message may be
displayed:

   Disk #b is currently in drive x. The catalog <catalog filename> starts
   on disk #a. Insert disk #a of the backup set to start catalog retrieval.

NOTE: "a" is the starting catalog disk and "b" is the next catalog disk.

Once you insert the starting catalog disk in the disk drive, Microsoft Backup
indicates that it is retrieving the catalog. After reading the disk, it displays
the following message:

   Disk #a is now in drive x. Insert the next disk to continue the retrieve.

After you insert the next disk, Microsoft Backup incorrectly indicates that it is
retrieving the catalog from the previous disk, even though the next disk is
actually in the disk drive. However, Microsoft Backup does successfully retrieve
the complete catalog file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS,
which ships with MS-DOS 6.0, 6.2, and 6.22. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
