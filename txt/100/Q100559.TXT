======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a file is first imported from MS-DOS to the Macintosh, it is not
automatically tagged as a FoxBASE+/Mac file until it is opened by FoxBASE+/Mac.
This means the file will not appear on the desktop with the proper icon and it
will not show up in the FoxBASE+/Mac File Finder dialog boxes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To open the imported file, click the All Files check box, and select the desired
file.

After FoxBASE+/Mac accesses a file for the first time, the file will thereafter
appear on the desktop with the proper icon and will be listed in the appropriate
File Finder dialog boxes. This information applies to all file types, including
programs, databases, memory variable save files, reporting descriptions, and
label descriptions.

Additional query words: 2.01 import export convert transfer
