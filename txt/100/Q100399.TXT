SUMMARY
=======

SoundBits functionality can be removed from operation in Windows, without
removing the program, by modifying your system.ini file. Use the following steps
to silence SoundBits in Windows 3.x and Windows 95.

Accessing System.ini in Windows 3.x
-----------------------------------

1. From the Program Manager File menu, choose Run.

2. In the Command Line field, type "sysedit" without the quotation marks). This
   runs the System Configuration Editor (SysEdit). Choose OK.

3. In SysEdit, select the system.ini window. This allows you to edit the
   system.ini file.

4. In the [boot] section of the system.ini file, remove all references to
   "sndevnts.drv" (this will be on a "drivers=" line).

5. In the [drivers] section, remove the following statement:

      wavemapper=msacm.drv

6. From the SysEdit File menu, choose Save.

7. Exit SysEdit and restart Windows.

When you restart Windows, SoundBits should be disabled.

Accessing your System.ini file in Windows 95
--------------------------------------------

If you are using Windows 95, most of the functionality of SoundBits is included
in the operating system. However, should you wish to remove the Sound Events
driver for SoundBits, you need only remove any references to SndEvnts.drv in
your system.ini. Making any other changes could impact the normal functioning of
Windows 95.

1. Click Start. Click Run.

2. On the Run command line, type the following and click OK.

      sysedit

3. In SysEdit, select the system.ini window.

4. Remove any references to "sndevnts.drv" (without the quotation marks).

5. On the File menu, click Save.

6. When you restart Windows, SoundBits should be disabled.
