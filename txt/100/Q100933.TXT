start Windows (in any mode), you may receive the following error message:

NOTE: Do not confuse the POWER.EXE file in this error message with the MS-DOS 6

MORE INFORMATION
================

Prohance's POWER.EXE is a program that allows you to configure the buttons of
the Prohance mouse. This program should be loaded in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Load
Prohance's POWER.EXE from the Prohance directory; otherwise, the MS-DOS 6 or 6.2
POWER.EXE may be found first and loaded.

Microsoft's POWER.EXE file ships with MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2 and reduces power
consumption when applications and devices are idle.

For more information on using advanced power management (APM) and Prohance's
POWER.EXE together, call Prohance Technical Support.

The Prohance Power Track multi-button trackball is manufactured by Prohance, a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
