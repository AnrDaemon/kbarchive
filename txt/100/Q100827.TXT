======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The -W option in the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) specifies a postoffice
that is connected through a wide-area network (WAN), and functions differently,
depending on which version of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks you are running.

In versions 3.0, 3.0a and 3.2 of Mail, EXTERNAL.EXE with the -W option transfers
the mail from the local postoffice to the WAN postoffice, but will not deliver
it to the individual users.

In version 2.1, EXTERNAL.EXE with the -W option transfers the mail to the WAN
postoffice and delivers it to the individual users.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To minimize the amount of network traffic, EXTERNAL.EXE was modified in Mail
versions 3.0 and later to transfer mail to the WAN postoffice but not deliver
it. The responsibility for delivering the mail should be handled by a local
workstation running EXTERNAL.EXE. If there is not a local workstation running
EXTERNAL.EXE, the mail will never be delivered to the final recipient.

Additional query words: 2.10 3.00 3.20 MTA
