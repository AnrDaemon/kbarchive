TITLE   :4DOS Causes "Write Protected" Error When Disk Is Full
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

If you are using 4DOS for your command interpreter, you may receive the "Write
Protected" error message if your disk is full.

You may receive the "Write Protected" error when you use COPY, XCOPY, Microsoft
Backup, Microsoft Backup for Windows, and so forth.

CAUSE
=====

This situation occurs because 4DOS incorrectly reports critical error 27h (Disk
Full) as a write-protect error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, obtain an updated version of 4DOS from JP Software.

4DOS is manufactured by JP Software, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make
no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
