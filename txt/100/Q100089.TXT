SUMMARY
=======

An early release of the updated Microsoft Anti-Virus and Microsoft Anti-Virus
for Windows engine files (available from Central Point Software) created
CHKLIST.CPS files instead of CHKLIST.MS files. As a result, you cannot delete
these files with the Delete CHKLST Files option in Microsoft Anti-Virus and
Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows.

If you want to delete the CHKLIST.CPS files, run MS-DOS Shell or Windows File
Manager, search on CHKLIST.CPS (starting from the root directory), and delete
the files.

Additional query words: MWAV 6.00 engine dosshell
