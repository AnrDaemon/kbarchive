TITLE   :PC WRmt: MAPI Ignores Scheduled Connections
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a message is sent from an application that uses Simple MAPI (such as
Microsoft Word version 2.0 for Windows), and you have version 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail Remote for Windows installed but not running, the message is always sent
immediately, despite the Mail Remote for Windows connection-scheduling feature
that tells Mail to wait until the scheduled time.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do either of the following:

 - Choose the Cancel button, which leaves the mail in the Outbox and lets it
   wait for the next scheduled connection.

-or-

 - Leave Mail Remote for Windows running in the background to ensure that it
   manages the scheduled connection.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Mail Remote for Windows is running when a user chooses the Send command from
inside the application, the message is put into the Outbox and sent at the next
scheduled connection or whenever the user activates the Send.

However, if Mail Remote for Windows is not running, performing a Send brings up
the password dialog box, the user is asked to Sign In, and the connection takes
place immediately.
