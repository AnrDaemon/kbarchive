======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Microsoft Mail for Windows, and Microsoft
Schedule+ for Windows may experience problems with meeting responses created
prior to the postoffice upgrade. The problem occurs after the postoffice has
been upgraded from a Windows version 3.1 for Workgroups postoffice to a version
3.0 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice using the Microsoft Mail and
Schedule+ Extensions for Microsoft Windows for Workgroups.

In the Windows client, the message request reply can be read, but will display
the message, "You are not this person's assistant." Usually, the View Schedule
button is displayed.

In Schedule+, if you choose the Reply button, the error message "Unable to access
the file for <Username>," is displayed. This is followed by the reply
appearing. As with the Windows client, the View Schedule button is not
displayed. The message, "Unable to access this person's schedule file," is shown
instead.

CAUSE
=====

This problem will appear if the network and postoffice names are changed during
the upgrade. This is expected behavior. If the postoffice name and network name
remain the same, this information does not apply.
