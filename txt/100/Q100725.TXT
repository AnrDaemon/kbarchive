TITLE   :PRB: SQL Server Driver GP-Faults with More Than 50 Datatypes
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

An ODBC application using a SQL Server driver earlier than version 1.01.2920
causes a general protection fault (GP-fault) when you attempt to connect to a
SQL Server database with more than 50 user-defined data types.


SYMPTOMS
========

When an ODBC application tries to connect to a SQL Server data source that has
more than 50 user-defined data types, it causes a general protection fault in
the module SQLSRVR.DLL. SQL Server has two different kinds of data types: system
defined and user-defined. System-defined data types are those that are defined
by SQL Server, such as CHAR, INT, DATETIME, and so on. User-defined datatypes
allow the user to define their own data types in terms of the system data types.
For example, you can have a data type called EMPID which maps to CHAR(5).

User-defined data types are specific to a database and are not server wide. Thus,
the ODBC application may be able to connect to a different database on the same
SQL Server, if that database has less than 50 user-defined data types. Visual
Basic users can encounter this problem when the Visual Basic application calls
the OpenDataBase function. Microsoft Access 1.0 users can encounter this problem
when they try to attach to a table.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in SQL Server driver version 1.01.2920, and is
available from your primary support provider. To install the new driver, run the
setup program from the update disk and reinstall the SQL Server driver. After
installing the driver, make sure you run the INSTCAT.SQL script that is
contained in the update disk.
