======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When FoxPro is outputting a character field to Microsoft Graph that contains
values that look like dates, the graph will display these numbers in the dd-mmm
(day-month) format. For example, a character field containing "1-10" or "1/10"
will display as "10-Jan" on the graph. Anything larger than "12-31" or "12/31"
displays correctly since there are no months that would correspond with these
numbers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem and display the character fields correctly, place a
blank space at the beginning of the character expression. To do this without
making any modifications to the actual database file, do the following:

1. FoxPro 2.X: In the RQBE window, select the Fields check box. Visual FoxPro:
   In the Query Designer window, select the Fields tab.

2. Remove the character field from the Selected Output list.

3. In the Functions/Expressions box, type the following:

   " "+<char>

   where <char> is the name of the character field.

4. Choose Move to move the expression to the Selected Output list.

5. Output the query to a graph.

The character field now displays correctly.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
