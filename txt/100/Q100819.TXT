TITLE   :NET.TXT: Updating LAN Manager 1.x Enhanced Networks
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After following the procedure for updating LAN Manager 1.x Enhanced and
100-percent compatible networks described in the NET.TXT file that is included
with the MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2 Supplemental Kit, you may receive the following
error messages at startup:

   NET 2413 : incorrect MS-DOS version.
   NET 2413 : incorrect MS-DOS version, error spawning workstation.

CAUSE
=====

These errors occur because the NETWKSTA.EXE file, which is used to start the
workstation, requires an entry in the MS-DOS 6 version table.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, add NETWKSTA.EXE to the Setver version table as MS-DOS
4.01 and ensure that SETVER.EXE is being loaded from the CONFIG.SYS file, as
follows:

1. Make sure that SETVER.EXE is being loaded in your CONFIG.SYS file. For
   example:

   device=c:\dos\setver.exe

2. Once your system has restarted completely, enter the following at an MS-DOS
   command prompt:

   " setver netwksta.exe 4.01" (without the quotation marks)

You should receive a message regarding the application that you are adding to the
MS-DOS 6.0 version table. This is normal. If the version table was successfully
updated, you can reboot your system, and the change will take effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on using the SETVER command with MS-DOS 6, type "help
setver" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt or query on
the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   "setver.exe" (without the quotation marks) and "version" (without the
   quotation marks) and "table" (without the quotation marks) and "6.0" (without
   the quotation marks)
