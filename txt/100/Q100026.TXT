The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for version 1.00 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail
contains an error that can disrupt gateway installation.

Page 22 of the "Administrator's Guide" states that the 3ComGateDomain entry is
PO1:NET1, when it would more commonly be entered as MSMAIL:MS, as follows:

   3ComGateDomain=MSMAIL:MS

Although PO1:NET1 is a legal 3+ name and may work, it is an unlikely name for a
new 3+Mail domain.

In keeping with the example on page 19, the new domain for the example on page 22
is MSMAIL and the original organization is MS, so the entry should be MSMAIL:MS.
This would log the computer on to the 3Com XNS Name/Mail service as:

   _GATEWAY:MSMAIL:MS.


Additional query words: 1.00 err
