SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft FoxPro supports the use of an external editor for the editing of text
files. In Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, this can either be a Windows-based
editor or an MS-DOS-based editor.

You can use the TEDIT entry in the CONFIG.FPW file to control what text editor
will be used.

The normal format for the TEDIT entry in the CONFIG.FPW file is:

   TEDIT=/0 <editor>

The /0 (slash zero) parameter is used to tell FoxPro to give the editor as much
memory as possible. This format can be used to start an MS-DOS-based editor such
as EDIT.COM from MS-DOS versions 5.0 and later, as follows:

   TEDIT=/0 EDIT.COM

If you want to use a Windows-based editor, you must use the /N parameter. This
parameter is used to specify that the program to be run is a Windows-based
program. For example, if you want to use NOTEPAD.EXE as your editor, use the
following line:

   TEDIT=/N NOTEPAD.EXE

For more information on the /0 and /N parameters, see the RUN command in the
Help file, or see the "Language Reference" manual.
