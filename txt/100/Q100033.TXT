TITLE   :Mac Wkst: Color Icons Do Not Appear in Summary Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, the color icons for
forms may not display in the Summary window.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you have an older version of the workstation software, or
if the form has been recompiled and reinstalled.

RESOLUTION
==========

Color icons for forms are not supported when the version 3.0 workstation
software is connected to a version 3.1 server. To display color icons in this
situation, upgrade the workstation to version 3.1.

This problem may also occur if you modify and recompile a form using the Forms
Designer HyperCard stack. This will cause the icon to appear in black and white
when you reinstall the form using the Form Mover button. The icons will install
properly; however, none of the screens in the form are recompiled. If you have
modified and compiled the form, the only way to reset the color icons is to
install the form from the original disk, without modifying it in any way.
