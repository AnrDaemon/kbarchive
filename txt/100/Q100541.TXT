TITLE   :Transferring a LAN Manager Server to a High-end Machine
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager

SUMMARY
=======

To transfer a LAN Manager server to a high-end machine, use the two procedures
below. The first transfers the accounts database, file privileges, logs, etc.
The second works for the ACL permissions on HPFS volumes.

FIRST PROCEDURE
---------------

1. Net stop workstation/server in the old machine.

2. Copy LAN Manager directory to LANMAN.BAK directory.

3. Start server and share the LANMAN.BAK directory as LMBAK sharename in the old
   machine.

4. Setup the new machine as backup domain controller. Transfer the
   LANMAN/ACCOUNTS directory.

5. Net use LMBAK and copy all files to LMBAK directory of the new machine.

6. Copy all directories from old machine except OS/2 and LAN Manager.

7. Net stop workstation/server in the new machine.

8. Copy all files of LMBAK directory to the new machine's LAN Manager directory.

9. Net start the new machine then change the backup domain controller to primary
   domain controller.

SECOND PROCEDURE (FOR EACH HPFS DRIVE)
--------------------------------------

Type:

   " backacc <drive>:\ /f:acl<drive>.acl /s[enter]" (without the
   quotation marks)

and copy the .ACL files to the new server. Type:

   " restacc <drive>:\ /f:acl<drive>.acl /s[enter]" (without the
   quotation marks)

In this case you are copying the ACL files to the new server then using Restacc
to apply the permissions stored in the files to the resources on the server. If
you can access the old server over the network the copy is not really needed;
just specify a redirected drive for the location on the restacc /f switch.
