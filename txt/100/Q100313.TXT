TITLE   :Windows for Workgroups "V86ModeLanas" and TCP/IP
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows for Workgroups setup makes several modifications to
the WFWG SYSTEM.INI file. Although the WFWG resource kit specifies that
SYSTEM.INI should contain the line V86ModeLanas=1, this line is NOT necessary,
and is not added by TCP/IP setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When VNetBIOS comes up, it probes for NetBIOS drivers on LANAs 0 through 7. The
default is to use all drivers found, so the V86ModeLana parameter limits the
drivers probed because some old transports answer on all LANAs even though there
is really only one driver on one card.

Because the Microsoft TCP/IP stack correctly uses the LANA number in the NCB, you
should NOT set the V86ModeLana parameter.
