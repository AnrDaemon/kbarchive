-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 6.0, 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The device driver for Corel optical drives may generate the following error
message when restarting a system:

   Sector size too large

To correct this problem, run the PATCH.EXE program supplied with optical drives
by Corel Corporation. PATCH.EXE modifies the IO.SYS file to allow the
recognition of a sector size greater than 512 bytes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to Corel Technical Support, the PATCH.EXE program executes
automatically the first time you install the optical device driver. However, any
time you upgrade the MS-DOS version, reformat your hard disk drive, or perform
any function that replaces the "patched" IO.SYS file, you must run PATCH.EXE
again.

For more information, call Corel Technical Support.
