-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

IBM Lan Server 2.0 does not directly support Remote Boot with MS-DOS 6.0. It was
released before MS-DOS 6.0 and supports MS-DOS through version 5.0 only.
However, the procedure in this article should allow you to use MS-DOS 6 with IBM
Lan Server 2.0 Remote Boot.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Follow these steps to enable IBM Lan Server 2.0 Remote Boot to work with MS-DOS
6:

1. Using a machine that has a floppy disk drive, run SETUP /F to create a MS-DOS
   6 Startup disk. For more information, see page 178 in the "User's Guide."

2. To free additional disk space, delete DBLSPACE.EXE from the Startup disk you
   created in step 1.

3. Expand RAMDRIVE.SYS to this Startup disk. For example, type "expand
   b:\ramdrive.sy_ a:\ramdrive.sys" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
   command prompt and then press ENTER.

4. At the OS/2 remote boot server, install the DOS Remote IPL Service as
   outlined in your IBM Lan Server manuals.

5. When you are prompted for the programs to copy to the fixed disk choose
   MS-DOS 5.0, even though you will actually be using MS-DOS 6.

6. When asked to specify the total number of MS-DOS disks, press 1.

7. When prompted for MS-DOS disks, insert the MS-DOS 6 Startup disk created in
   step 1.

8. Complete your installation of DOS Remote IPL Service as normal. Your remote
   boot workstation should boot from MS-DOS 6.

9. Install the rest of the MS-DOS 6 files in the directory on the server (the
   default name for this directory is IBMLAN\DOSLAN\DOS) with one of the
   following methods:

    - On a machine with a hard disk drive running MS-DOS 6, run SETUP /Q to a
      directory on the local hard disk drive and then copy the resulting files
      in this directory (and all the MS-DOS 6 files) to the IBMLAN\DOSLAN\DOS
      directory on the server.

   -or-

    - Expand the MS-DOS 6 files from the floppy disks into your
      IBMLAN\DOSLAN\DOS directory on the server.

   -or-

    - If the server is configured for dual boot, boot into MS-DOS and run SETUP
      to the IBMLAN\DOSLAN\DOS directory on the server.
