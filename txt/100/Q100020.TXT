-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you log on to a Microsoft LAN Manager domain when starting Windows for
Workgroups and you are running a logon script that makes network drive
connections, the following error message may appear:

   An error occurred while reconnecting X: to <\\SERVER\SHARE:>
   [SYS0000]
   Do you want to continue restoring connections?

This error may appear for one or more persistent network connections. Although
this error occurs, any persistent connections should still be accessible from
File Manager.


CAUSE
=====

Using LAN Manager logon scripts for network drive connections in conjunction
with Windows for Workgroups is not recommended since Windows for Workgroups
maintains its own list of persistent network connections in the CONNECT.DAT
file. If you need to use a logon script for network drive connections, use the
workaround detailed below.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this error message, rename the CONNECT.DAT file in the Windows
directory to CONNECT.OLD and add the /PERSISTENT:NO (/P:N) parameter to lines in
the logon script that make network drive connections. The following line is an
example:

      net use x: \\server\share /p:n

Any previous Windows for Workgroups persistent network connections that aren't
created with the logon script need to be manually reconnected, which rewrites
the CONNECT.DAT file. Make sure not to create any network connections that are
already in the logon script.

Once the Windows for Workgroups persistent connections are re-created, you should
not have any problems using logon scripts for other network connections as long
as there is a /P:N parameter after the NET USE command so that it does not write
to the CONNECT.DAT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error is caused by the LAN Manager logon script using a NET USE command,
which by default writes the network drive connection to the CONNECT.DAT file
used by Windows for Workgroups for persistent network connections.

The Windows for Workgroups 386 enhanced mode redirector always looks for a
CONNECT.DAT file for any persistent connections and tries to establish any
connections present in the file. Since a connection was already created by the
NET USE command in the logon script, when the 386 enhanced redirector tries to
make the connection, the above error message appears.

This error does not occur if you start Windows for Workgroups in standard mode
since the real-mode redirector should have already been started at MS-DOS and
any persistent network connections are established at that point.
