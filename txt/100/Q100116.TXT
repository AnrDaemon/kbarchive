-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following MS-DOS programs use the MSDOSDATA environment variable to
determine where to put their .INI files:

   Microsoft Undelete
   Microsoft Undelete for Windows
   Microsoft Anti-Virus
   Microsoft Backup

If the MSDOSDATA environment variable is not set, the .INI file is created in the
same directory as the .EXE file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Backup for Windows
----------------------------

Microsoft Backup for Windows uses the WINDIR environment variable to determine
where to place the MWBACKUP.INI file; however, all other files (DEFAULT.SET,
catalog files, and so forth) go in the directory specified by MSDOSDATA, if that
environment variable is set. If MSDOSDATA is not set, Microsoft Backup for
Windows creates the MWBACKUP.INI file in the directory that contains the
MWBACKUP.EXE file.

Once the location of the files (other than the MWBACKUP.INI file) has been
determined, the drive and directory path is saved in the MWBACKUP.INI file. This
path is used to find the files in the future.


Additional query words: 6.00 msav.exe mwav.exe mwbackup.exe 6.20 msbackup.exe "Cannot create the setup file" default.set
