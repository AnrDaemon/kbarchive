SYMPTOMS
========

Versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows add and display the
same user listing to the Personal Address Book more than one time.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you select the Add Recipients To Personal Address Book
option, then send mail to the same person twice. The first time you send mail,
the person's name is selected from the Global Address List; the second time you
send mail, the name is selected from the Postoffice Address List.

======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. This problem was corrected in version 3.2a (which
includes MSSFS.DLL version 3.2.0.4074).
