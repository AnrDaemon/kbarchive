TITLE   :PRB: RQBE Drops Field Name in Output After Saving
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:2.0,2.5; WINDOWS:2.5,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.5 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are selecting output fields in the Relational Query By Example (RQBE)
tool, you can create a new field and specify a field heading. This heading will
appear in the SELECT statement and the query will contain the new field with the
heading. The query will later produce the desired results unless the RQBE window
is saved and opened again, in which case the field heading for the new field
will be dropped and FoxPro will substitute "Exp_<#>", where <#> is a
number signifying the display position of the field.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you need to make a change to an existing query, repeat steps 2-4 above, and
remove "string" from the fields list.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in FoxPro version 2.5a for Windows and in FoxPro
version 2.5a for MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. From the File menu, choose Open, and select the database to open.

2. From the File menu, choose New, select Query, and then choose New.

3. Select Fields.

4. In the text box under the Function popup list, type the following:

   " "string" as Newfield" (without the quotation marks)

5. Choose Move to add "'string' as Newfield" to the Selected Output list. Choose
   OK.

6. Choose See SQL.

   The SELECT statement will contain "'string' as Newfield" in the fields list.

7. Choose Do Query. The query result will have a field titled "Newfield"
   containing the word "string" in every record.

8. Save the query, close it, and reopen it. The Output fields list will now list
   just "'string'" NOT "'string'" as Newfield". However, the See SQL push button
   will still show "'string' as Newfield" and the query result will still label
   the field as "Newfield".

9. Make any other change. Save the query. The field name will be dropped.
   Running the query will produce a field labeled "Exp_#" instead of "Newfield".
