TITLE   :PRB: MASM Code Using CMACROS.INC Does Not Build Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to build a Windows-based application with MASM code using a
CMACROS.INC header file causes errors to be generated by the macro assembler.

CAUSE
=====

The CMACROS.INC file is incompatible with the version of MASM being used.

RESOLUTION
==========

When using MASM version 6.x, use the version of CMACROS.INC that comes with
MASM. When using MASM version 5.1, use the version of CMACROS.INC that comes
with the development product you are using, such as the Windows Software
Development Kit (SDK) or the Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK).

MORE INFORMATION
================

MASM has changed considerably from version 5.1 to versions 6.x; the changes to
the assembler include the removal of the second assembly pass and additions or
modifications to the behavior of assembler directives. A complete list of the
differences can be found in the product documentation of MASM versions 6.0 and
later. Because of these changes, versions of CMACROS.INC compatible with MASM
5.1 are not compatible with MASM 6.x; likewise, versions of CMACROS.INC
compatible with MASM 6.x are not compatible with MASM 5.1.

Most of Microsoft's development products include a version of CMACROS.INC that is
compatible with MASM 5.1. Use this version of CMACROS.INC with MASM 5.1. If MASM
version 6.0 or later is being used, use the CMACROS.INC that comes with it
instead of the one that comes with the development product.
