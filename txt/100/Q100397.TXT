SUMMARY
=======

If you select the Windows default sound scheme after selecting a Sound Bits
sound scheme, the two schemes will both run simultaneously. In other words,
choosing the default sound scheme does not cancel your selection of the Sound
Bits sound scheme. You will hear sounds from both schemes. This behavior is by
design.

To reset your sound scheme to the Windows default scheme only, follow these
steps:

1. From the Windows Control Panel, choose Sound.

2. From the Sound Schemes list box, select None.

3. Choose OK.

4. Run Sound again.

5. From the Sound Schemes menu, select Windows Default.

6. Choose OK.

This resets your sound scheme to the Windows default sounds only.
