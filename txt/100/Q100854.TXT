SUMMARY
=======

MS-DOS Upgrade Setup adds your MS-DOS directory (typically C:\DOS) to each PATH
statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For example, if your MS-DOS directory is
C:\DOS and you have the following two path statements

   PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\BATCH
   PATH=%PATH%;C:\BIN

Setup adds C:\DOS; to both of them, resulting in the following:

   PATH=C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS;C:\BATCH
   PATH=C:\DOS;%PATH%;C:\BIN

If your MS-DOS directory is in the PATH twice, some applications may not behave
as expected. For example, Windows Setup finds MS-DOS-based applications twice
when it searches your hard disk based on the PATH.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 6.20
