SUMMARY
=======

When you are running the Hanna-Barbera sound schemes "Boinks, Splats, &
Zips" or "'Toon Talks," you may receive a general protection (GP) fault if you
rapidly minimize and/or maximize many windows one after the other. These sound
schemes assign sounds to the actions of maximizing and minimizing windows.
Playing these sounds in very rapid succession may lead to the following error
message:

   Application Error
   PROGMAN caused a GPF in module MVPROAUD.DRV at 0001:0A21

This problem does not occur if you are using version 1.2 or later of the
MediaVision sound board driver (MVPROAUD.DRV).

To obtain updated drivers, contact MediaVision technical support at (510)
770-9905. You also can connect to the MediaVision bulletin board service (BBS)
