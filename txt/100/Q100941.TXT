The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In most cases, MS-DOS Upgrade Setup places SETVER.EXE on the first line of the
CONFIG.SYS file. However, if you are loading ASPI4DOS.SYS, Setup places the
command for SETVER.EXE after the command for ASPI4DOS.SYS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have a DEVICEHIGH command for SETVER.EXE in your CONFIG.SYS file before
you run Setup, Setup removes that command and adds the following one to the top
of the file:

      DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE

If you are loading ASPI4DOS.SYS, the above line is added after the command for
ASPI4DOS. In either case, SETVER is loaded into conventional memory.

To optimize your memory configuration after installing MS-DOS 6, run MemMaker.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 6.20
