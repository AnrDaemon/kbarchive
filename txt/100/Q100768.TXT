TITLE   :X400: Downstream Users Receive Multiple Copies of Same Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 downstream postoffice mail
recipients may receive multiple copies of the same mail message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs only when the message is generated by certain foreign X.400
systems and does not occur when backboning Microsoft Mail postoffices through
X.400. In the following text, P1 and P2 apply to X.400 messages only.

When an X.400 message comes into the X.400 gateway with one recipient in P1 (or
one recipient with P1 responsibility bit set to TRUE and the rest FALSE) and
multiple P2 recipients located at a downstream postoffice (not the gateway
postoffice), the X.400 gateway formats the message using all the P2 recipients
for delivery.

The result is that one mail message is created and addressed to the same
recipient, for as many recipients as are listed in the P2.

STATUS
======

This problem has been corrected in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to
X.400.
