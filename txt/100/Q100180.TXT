TITLE   :TrueType Fonts Print Incorrectly on HP DeskJet 500
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you print TrueType fonts to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 500 printer, the
printed page may contain garbage lines, blocks, and characters.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you use the original HP DeskJet 500 driver that ships
with Windows 3.1 (HPDSKJET.DRV version 1.1) with UNIDRV.DLL file (version
3.1.2).


RESOLUTION
==========

You can correct this problem by updating HPDSKJET.DRV to the new version
(version 2.1) from Hewlett-Packard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the HPDSKJET.DRV version 1.1
included with Windows 3.1. This problem does not occur in later versions of the
driver or Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The UNIDRV.DLL file is used by many of the drivers in Windows 3.1 and by many of
the updated drivers. If a driver that uses the newer UNIDRV.DLL is installed and
the original DeskJet 500 driver that ships with Win 3.1 is not updated, the
above problem occurs.

Changing resolution from 300dpi to 150dpi will allow printing without the extra
characters. Change resolution from Printers Control Panel, choose Setup and
change resolution.
