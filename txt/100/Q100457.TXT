======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows user sends mail that is High or Low
Priority and Return-Receipt, it is received. However, the High or Low symbol
does not appear next to the envelope in the recipient's inbox.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The Return-Receipt feature functions correctly. Mail sent
with High or Low priority without the return receipt also functions correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft PC Mail Shared File System (SFS) priority paradigm is as follows:

 - R (registered)

 - C (confirmation)

 - 1-5 (priority)

These priorities are exclusive priorities.

Registered priority takes precedence over high priority in the priority field and
priority is lost.


Additional query words: 3.20
