SUMMARY
=======

An "Invalid File Format" error appears if an outdated or corrupted .VBX or .DLL
file used by MindMaze is encountered. This may occur if a MindMaze file is
deleted or overwritten after installing Encarta.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MindMaze copies and uses these .VBX and .DLL files:

   VBRUN200.DLL
   ANIBUTON.VBX
   CMDIALOG.VBX
   MCI.VBX
   SBC.VBX
   THREED.VBX

When you run MindMaze, it searches for the files in this order:

1. Current directory

2. WINDOWS directory

3. WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory

4. Path directories

To resolve this error, locate and delete duplicate copies of these files on the
hard disk drive, and recopy the above files to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

Note that a "minimum installation" of Encarta corrects this problem. A minimum
installation forces MindMaze to read the correct files from the compact disc
Viewer 2.0

Additional query words: 1.00 game message multimedia multi media multi-media start open begin mindmaze encarta cd launch
