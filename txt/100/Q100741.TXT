-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) version of MS-DOS that uses
logical sectoring, you receive the following message if you start your computer
with the MS-DOS 6 or 6.2 Upgrade Setup Disk 1 in drive A:

   Setup cannot install MS-DOS 6 because there is no operation system on this
   computer.

CAUSE
=====

This error message is displayed because MS-DOS Upgrade does not recognize your
partitioning scheme.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Restart (boot) your computer from the hard disk, your original OEM MS-DOS
   disk, or another floppy disk that boots your current version of MS-DOS.

2. Run Setup from MS-DOS Upgrade Setup Disk 1.

Setup automatically converts your nonstandard (logical sector) large partition to
MS-DOS 5.0, 6.0, or 6.2 compatible large partitions.
