When a 256-color video driver is being used, Microsoft PaintBrush can
open and display an existing 256-color image; however, PaintBrush may
not be able to properly paste and save the 256-color image. When a 256-
color image is pasted and saved in PaintBrush, reopening the file may
reveal that the image has changed to black or nearly black.
