SYMPTOMS

If you run Microsoft MemMaker on a Tandy 3810 or 1100HD laptop computer, you may
receive the following error message:

   MemMaker cannot run on this computer. To use MemMaker, you must have MS-DOS
   6.0, an 80386 or higher processor, and at least 384K of extended memory. To

CAUSE

The Tandy 3810 laptop computer is an 80386-based computer that comes with 2
megabytes (MB) of memory. In the CMOS setting of the computer, there is an

==========

To successfully run MemMaker, disable "Remap Shadow RAM" in the CMOS setting of
the laptop computer.

If you do not know how to change this option, call Tandy Corporation Computer
Support for assistance. Once MemMaker completes its process, the "Remap Shadow
RAM" option can be turned back ON.
