SUMMARY
=======

To assign an owner to ownerless files in Novell NetWare 2.x and 3.x using the
NetWare Filer utility (FILER.EXE), do the following:

1. Log in to the network as Supervisor.

2. At the Mail database directory, change to the subdirectory where the
   suspected ownerless file resides.

3. Run the Filer utility by typing the following and pressing ENTER:

   "filer" (without the quotation marks)

4. From the Available Topics menu, select Directory Contents, then press ENTER.
   A listing of the files in the subdirectory will be displayed.

5. To assign an owner to a single file:

   a. Use the arrow keys to move the insertion point to the suspected file and
      press ENTER.

   b. From the File Options menu, select View/Set File Information and press
      ENTER.

   c. From the File Information For <filename> menu, select the Owner
      field and press ENTER.

      A list of valid NetWare user names will be displayed.

   d. Highlight the Supervisor name and press ENTER. Microsoft recommends
      assigning Supervisor as the owner because this user name will never be
      deleted from the bindery, thus eliminating the chance of the file becoming
      ownerless in the future.

   To assign an owner to multiple files:

   a. From the Directory Contents menu, use the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys to
      select each suspected file and press the F5 key at each file to select the
      file. When you have selected each file, press ENTER.

   b. From the Multiple File Operations menu, select Set Owner and press ENTER.

   c. At the New File Owner prompt, use the BACKSPACE key to clear the previous
      name, then type the name "Supervisor."
