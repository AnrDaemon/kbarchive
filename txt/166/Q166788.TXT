SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to save a document containing an embedded control, such as a
CommandButton, and a Visual Basic for Applications Reference has been added but
is now missing, the following error is displayed:

   The disk is full. Free some space on this drive, or save the document on
   another disk.


WORKAROUND

   References dialog box.

   The References dialog box displays all object libraries and projects that are
   registered with the operating system.

2. Scroll through the list for the library that is indicated as missing.

3. Click to clear the check box for the reference in the Available References
   list and click OK.

4. On the File menu, click "Close and Return to Microsoft Word."
