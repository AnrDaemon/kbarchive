SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT can audit when a user or group is added to or removed from a User
Right. To audit these types of actions, in User Manager, on the Policies menu,
click Audit. In Audit Policy, click Audit These Events and select Security
Policy Changes. This is the only audit category needed to audit these specific
actions. However, the following rights do not show up in the Security log when
Security Policy Changes are being audited. Changes to other rights were
successfully audited.

The following rights are not audited:

 - Access this computer from network

 - Log on as a service

 - Log on as a batch job

 - Log on locally

CAUSE
=====

There was no associated code to log these events.
