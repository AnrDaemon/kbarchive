TITLE   :SNA Server Rejects FMH-5 Attach Intended for TP on NT Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1,2.11 SP2,3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Even though an auto-started invokable APPC or CPIC Transaction Program (TP) is
configured on an SNA Server Windows NT client computer, SNA Server may reject
the host FMH-5 Attach request and log the following error

   Event ID: 60
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: Failed to invoke APPC TP <tpname>, sense data = 084C0000

where 084C0000 refers to AP_TRANS_PGM_NOT_AVAIL_NO_RETRY.

CAUSE
=====

When the SNA Server Windows NT client loses its sponsor connection to the
SnaBase service on the SNA Server, the client does not alway report configured
TPs to the server when the sponsor connection is re-established. This can occur
if SNA Server is restarted while SNA Server Windows NT clients have active
sponsor connections and are not restarted.

A timing window in the SNA Server Windows NT client software causes this problem
to occur; the probability of the problem may increase as the client processor
speed increases.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11, 2.11
Service Pack 1 (SP1), and 2.11 SP2. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
