PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbProgramming kbide kbVC kbVC500bug kbVC600bug kbGrpDSTools kbNoUpdatekbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A header file listed in the SYSINCL.DAT file still appears in the External
Dependencies list.

CAUSE
=====

The directory to the header file is specified with forward slash (sys/test.h)
rather than a backward slash (sys\test.h) in the SYSINCL.DAT file. Specifying
the directory with a backslash in the SYSINCL.DAT file excludes files that are
included in the source file with either forward or backward slashes. For
example:

#include <sys/test1.h>
   #include <sys\test2.h>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The files listed in SYSINCL.DAT should be excluded from dependency scanning and
not be displayed in the External Dependencies folder.
