TITLE   :DUMPCHK.EXE Incorrectly Reports Some Dump Files as Invalid
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbusagekbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

While in the phase where Dumpchk.exe validates all virtual addresses, the
program reports that specific memory dump files are corrupt. These same memory
dump files are not corrupt and may be debugged without any problems.

CAUSE
=====

Dumpchk.exe does not correctly handle a situation where there are "large pages"
in the memory dump file. This leads the program to incorrectly conclude that
memory dump files with large pages are corrupt.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Memory dump files are generated when a system STOP error occurs provided the
system has been correctly configured to save debug information through the
Control Panel.

These memory dump files can often be used to diagnose the cause of the system
STOP error. Because these files are often very large, Dumpchk.exe is often used
to determine whether a given dump file was generated successfully or whether it
might be corrupt and therefore not useful. The problem described here can result
in some files being rejected when they are not corrupt.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
