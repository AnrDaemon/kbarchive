TITLE   :Incorrect File Listing on NetWare Server with DIR /TC Command
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the DIR /TC command to list files on a network drive on a Novell
NetWare server, you may get inconsistent results. The DIR /TC command should
list files along with their creation time.

CAUSE
=====

If a file has a short file name (standard 8.3 naming), Windows NT uses a "Search
File NCP" command for files as if they are stored on a drive using the FAT (File
Allocation Table) file system, which does not return a creation time. If a file
has a long file name, the correct creation time is returned.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
