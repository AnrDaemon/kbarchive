SYMPTOMS

You may not be able to remove Windows Messaging by clearing the Windows

Outlook and restart the computer, you can remove Windows Messaging.

If you want to reinstall Windows Messaging, you should do so before reinstalling
Outlook.

information services. To do so, click Windows Messaging on the Windows NT Setup
tab in the Add/Remove Programs tool, and then click Details.
