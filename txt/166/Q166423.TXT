The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a high frequency of events and the event log is set to overwrite old
entries as needed, Services.exe might hit an access violation in Eventlog.dll.

Since Services.exe hosts several essential Windows NT system services as well as
the service control manager your computer might hang or refuse to shut down
after such a failure.

CAUSE
=====

There have been code paths in Eventlog.dll with insufficient error checking
which only appear under stress conditions.
