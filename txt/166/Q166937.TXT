======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how you can programmatically add images to the ImageList
ActiveX control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An ImageList control contains a collection of ListImage objects, each of which
can be referred to by its index or key. The ImageList ActiveX control acts as a
central image repository to conveniently supply other controls with images.

In order to add an image at run time, you need to use the Add Method of the
ListImages collection.

Syntax
------

The Add method syntax has these parts:

   Object.Add([Index,| Key,] Picture)

 - Index - Optional. An integer specifying the position where you want to insert
   the ListImage. If no index is specified, the ListImage is added to the end of
   the ListImages collection.
 - Key - Optional. A unique string that identifies the ListImage object. Use
   this value to retrieve a specific ListImage object. An error occurs if the
   key is not unique.
 - Picture - Required. Specifies the picture to be added to the ImageList
   ActiveX Control.

Example
-------

The steps below demonstrate how to create an example of one of these controls:

1. Create a form.

2. Add an ImageList ActiveX control to the form and change the ImageList ActiveX
   control name to ImageList1.

3. Add a SSTab ActiveX control and change the SSTab control name to SSTab1. By
   default, SSTab always has three pages. If using Visual FoxPro 5.0a, the SSTab
   control has been renamed to Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control, version 5.0.
   Other development tools, such as Visual Basic, may have replaced the SSTab
   control with the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control even if the Visual FoxPro
   version is 5.0 (not 5.0a).

4. Add a Command button and change the Caption of the command button to "Click
   Me."

5. In the INIT method of the form, put in the following code:

   

         Thisform.ImageList1.Object.ListImages.Add(1,,LoadPicture;
               (HOME()+"samples\graphics\bmps\outline\leaf.bmp"))
         Thisform.ImageList1.Object.ListImages.Add(2,,LoadPicture;
               (HOME()+"samples\graphics\bmps\outline\open.bmp"))
         Thisform.ImageList1.Object.ListImages.Add(3,,LoadPicture;
               (HOME()+"samples\graphics\bmps\outline\closed.bmp"))

6. In the CLICK method of the Command button, put in the following code:

   

          FOR i = 0 TO 2
              Thisform.SSTab1.Object.Tab = i
              Thisform.SSTab1.Object.Picture = ;
                Thisform.ImageList1.ListImages(i+1).Picture
          ENDFOR
          Thisform.SSTab1.Object.Tab = 0

7. Save and run the form. Click the "Click Me" button, and the images will
   display in the SSTab ActiveX control.

NOTE: Due to the Add method requiring an object reference for the image file, you
need to use the LoadPicture function to return the object reference instead of
directly using the image file.

You are not limited to any particular image size; however, the total number of
images that can be loaded into ImageList ActiveX control is limited by the
amount of available memory.

At design time, you can add images using the Image tab of the ImageList Control
Properties dialog box. To access this, right-click (secondary) on the ImageList
control and select ImageListCtrl Properties from the shortcut menu. Omit step 5
above to have images added in this manner show on the tabs when the Command
button is clicked.

The code in step 6 above could be placed in the Init method of the form to have
the SSTab control show the images when the form is loaded.
