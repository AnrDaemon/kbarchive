======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Cinemania for Windows, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 editions 
 - Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Windows 
 - Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 97 Deluxe for Windows 
 - Microsoft Music Central for Windows, 1996, 1997 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click one of the Online buttons in your multimedia program, your modem
attempts to dial a phone number that you did not intend to dial instead of
dialing the access number you use to connect to MSN.

This phone number may be the number of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that
you used previously.

For example, one of the following may occur:

 - When you start Cinemania and click the Online button, the phone number for
   MSN, The Microsoft Network dials, even though you no longer subscribe to MSN.

-or-

 - When you start Encarta, and click Download. The phone number for CompuServe
   dials, even though you no longer subscribe to CompuServe.

CAUSE
=====

The programs listed at the top of this article cannot start the built-in America
Online (AOL) Web browser. They can only start standard (standalone) Web
browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.

The multimedia programs are attempting to start your Web browser. If you have a
standalone Web browser, it will be activated, even if you are currently using
AOL. Because of the way the web browser stores settings, your modem may dial the
number for previous online service, or a default phone number that set by the
distributor of the web browser.

RESOLUTION
==========

You need to dial AOL manually using the method that you normally use to make a
connection to the Internet. Then you can connect to the Online features using a
standalone browser.

1. Start your AOL software and log in.

2. When you receive the "Welcome" message, leave AOL running.

   NOTE: At this point, AOL should be providing an Internet connection that the
   programs listed at the top of this article can use to access a web site.

3. Start your multimedia programs and use any of the online features. Your
   standalone Web browser will open and connect to the Web site. The browser
   will not attempt to dial your modem, since an Internet connection is already
   open.

NOTE: If you are using Windows 95, you should be using "AOL 3.0 for Windows 95."
This version is capable of interacting with other Windows 95 programs, such as
standalone 32-bit Web browsers and Cinemania's Download Wizard. "AOL 3.0 for
Windows" is not.

To find out what version of AOL 3.0 you are using, click the Help menu, and then
click About. For information on obtaining "AOL 3.0 for Windows 95", use the AOL
Keyword "upgrade".

AOL version 3.0 is manufactured by America Online, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
