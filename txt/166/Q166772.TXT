TITLE   :S3 Video Performance Improved in Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Response times on S3 video-based systems are not optimal. Also, periodically
because of the refresh rate, the mouse does not respond as you expect if mouse
move events are requested in quick succession.

CAUSE
=====

For each mouse cursor movement, Windows NT is waiting for a V-refresh. However,
on the current S3 video chipsets, this is no longer required.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, please install the latest Windows NT Service Pack. This
problem is fixed in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3.0 and later.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server and Windows NT
Workstation version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT version 4.0. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
