The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Anomaly Tracking System, version 1.0, included with:
    - Microsoft Visual Studio 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When logging on to the Anomaly Tracking System (ATS), a user who does not have
Administrator rights can make text and property changes to existing records.
These could be records that were entered by other users.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Every time a change is made to an existing record, the details of the change can
be viewed by looking at the History tab of the record. Whenever a change is made
to an existing record, the User ID along with the date of the change is listed
with the description of the changes.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Add a user without Administrator rights to ATS.

2. Log back into ATS as the new user.

3. Run the "All Issues" query.

4. Open one of the existing records shown in the "All Issues" results dialog
   box.

At this point, any of the text and settings on the Detail, History, or Attributes
tabs can be modified. Once any changes have been made, the Save option is
enabled.
