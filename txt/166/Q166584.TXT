TITLE   :XFOR: IMS Does Not Immediately Reject Inbound Connections
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Mail Service (IMS) does not immediately reject incoming connections
after the maximum inbound connection limit has been reached.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the maximum inbound connection limit has been reached, the IMS should
immediately reject any new inbound connections. Instead, the IMS queues the
connection for reverse DNS resolution. This can result in a large queue of
connections to be resolved.

The maximum inbound connection limit is 30 by default. To set the maximum inbound
connection limit in the IMS:

 - Click Connections. On the Advanced tab, type the maximum inbound connection
   limit.


Additional query words: IMS DNS inbound limit SP1
