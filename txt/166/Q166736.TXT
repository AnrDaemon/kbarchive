The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You will receive a User Name dialog box when you start Word 97.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the User Information tab is blank.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent the User Name dialog box from appearing, use the following steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the User Information tab.

3. Select the Name area and press the SPACEBAR to insert a blank space.

   NOTE: You may want to repeat this step for Initials and Mailing Address.

4. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may not want user information recorded on the User Information tab in Word.
If you clear the Name and Initials boxes, Word will prompt you with the User
Name dialog box when you restart Microsoft Word 97.

NOTE: Default entries will be placed in the Name and Initials boxes of the User
Name dialog box when you restart Word. The User Information is shared between
the Microsoft Office applications.

Word uses the User Information for the following items:

 - Property Sheet Information

 - Letters, Envelopes, and Memos

 - Track Changes

 - Comments

In Microsoft Word versions 6.0/95, when you delete the Name and Initials on the
User Information tab, the OK button will become unavailable. To clear the Name
and Initials boxes, you need to enter at least one character or press
CTRL+SHIFT+SPACEBAR.

Additional query words: userinfo username
