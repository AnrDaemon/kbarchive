SYMPTOMS
========

If you have selected text within a table cell and you run the following sample
Visual Basic for Applications code,

      With Selection.Cells.Shading
         .Texture = wdTextureSolid
         .ForegroundPatternColorIndex = wdRed
         .BackgroundPatternColorIndex = wdAuto
      End With

the shading is applied to the selected text only instead of the entire table
cell.

To work around this problem, specify a table cell by index. For example, the
following Visual Basic for Applications code specifies the cell containing the
insertion point:

      If Selection.Information(wdWithInTable) = True Then
         Selection.Cells(1).Shading.BackgroundPatternColorIndex = wdRed
      Else
         MsgBox "The insertion point is not in a table."
      End If

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
