SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document that contains color borders, all or part of the border
is printed as a line in solid black instead of in shades of gray. This problem
occurs when you use the following printer driver:

 - Hewlett Packard IIIsi PS (Postscript)


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Use the PCL Driver
----------------------------

Install and print using the printer's PCL printer driver. This is a
non-PostScript printer driver.

Method 2: Draw Your Borders
---------------------------

1. On the Drawing toolbar, click the Line or Rectangle tool, and draw the line
   or border in the document.

2. The drawing object should be selected after you draw it. If it is not
   selected, click the object to select it.

   You should see the black sizing handles for the object.

3. On the Format menu, click Drawing Object.

4. On the Line tab, change the "Weight" and "Color" to the settings you want,
   and then click OK.

NOTE: If you need to reposition the object, select the drawing object, hold the
SHIFT key down, and use the mouse to drag the drawing object to the correct
position.
