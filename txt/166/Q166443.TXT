TITLE   :Configuring a Novell DOS/Win Client-32 for DHCP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51,4.0; :
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you convert a Novell NetWare Client-32 for DOS/Windows to use DHCP, you
receive the following error message on startup:

   Warning: Interface is not configured.
   Error binding TCP/IP protocols to 3C5X9.
   Could not bind IP/ARP protocol stack to the board.

NOTE: The example above is for a 3Com 3c5x9 network adapter; the error message
you receive may be slightly different.

CAUSE
=====

As a static client, the Net.cfg file contained the following section:

PROTOCOL TCPIP
   BIND 3C5X9 1 ETHERNET_II interface_1
   IP_ADDRESS 130.57.4.126 interface_1
   IP_NETMASK 255.255.252.0 interface_1
   IP_ROUTER 130.57.4.254 interface_1

If you follow Novell's guidelines, your Net.cfg file will look like this:

PROTOCOL TCPIP
   BIND 3C5X9 1 ETHERNET_II interface_1
   IF_CONFIGURATION DHCP

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, remove the BIND statement from the Net.cfg file, so
it contains the below statements:

   PROTOCOL TCPIP
      IF_CONFIGURATION DHCP

NOTE: The Startnet.bat file must contain the frame type ETHERNET_II

MORE INFORMATION
================

You must use the following file to use the following options:

   Tcpip.nlm   215222   1-27-97     10:10:34 PM

The updated file is part of Tcp32d.exe, dated 29 MAR 97, and can be downloaded
from Novell's ftp site.

 - To add a Hostname to the DHCP client, the Net.cfg file should have the
   following:

      PROTOCOL TCPIP
         HOSTNAME <host_name>

 - To prevent the client from caching IP addresses, add the following entry to
   the Net.cfg file. This causes duplicate addresses on the network, if unable
   to contact DHCP server on startup.

      PROTOCOL TCPIP
         DHCPCACHEIP=NO

   Therefore, the protocol TCP/IP section of the Net.cfg file would look like
   this:

      PROTOCOL TCPIP
         PATH TCP CFG C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\TCP
         IF_CONFIGURATION DHCP
         HOSTNAME <host_name>
         DHCPCACHEIP=NO
