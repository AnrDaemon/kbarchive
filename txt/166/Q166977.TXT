TITLE   :WD97: Erratic Scrolling Caused by Large Objects
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui kbusage word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The scroll box on the scroll bar may be erratic (it may "jump" or change size)
when you scroll through your document. This problem occurs if the document
includes tall pictures and if you view the document in online layout view.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by sudden, radical changes in virtual page size. In
online view, the virtual page size varies with the height of the

window and is extended by drawing objects and inline pictures. In documents

with large pictures, the current page size can differ drastically from the
average page size, and the scroll bar calculations (visible height divided by
the approximate total height) will be wrong. This same problem can occur in page
layout view with multiple custom page sizes.

This behavior should only be apparent when the scroll box is on a page with
objects that meet this description.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
