The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the RUNDLL32 application that is provided with Windows NT and
Windows 95 to debug Control Panel applets. Use the following debug settings (set
by selecting Build/Settings in Visual C++ version 4.x, or by selecting
Project/Settings in Visual C++ version 2.x and 5.0):

Executable For Debug Session: C:\winnt\system32\rundll32.exe

   - or -

                              C:\windows\rundll32.exe
Working Directory:
Program Arguments: shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL [path and name of
                                               CPL file]
Remote Executable Path and File Name:

The two choices for "Executable For Debug Session" are for both Windows NT and
Windows 95. You must type in the name "Control_RunDLL" exactly, and you must use
the full path and name of the Control Panel applet (.CPL file). You do not have
to provide information for "Working Directory" and "Remote Executable Path and
File Name."

MORE INFORMATION
================

The technique described here is subject to change in future versions of Windows
and is provided for debugging purposes only. If you want your application to
launch control panel applications programmatically, you should use the
Control.exe program.
