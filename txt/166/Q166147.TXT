TITLE   :XFOR: Error Adding Connection to Microsoft Mail Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a direct connection to a Microsoft Mail postoffice using the
Microsoft Exchange Server Microsoft Mail Connector, the following error message
may be displayed:

   A postoffice with the name already exists on the network. Enter a
   different name.

CAUSE
=====

There may be an erroneous postoffice definition in the Microsoft Exchange shadow
postoffice.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

1. Map a drive to the Exchange Server shadow postoffice. The shadow postoffice
   is shared on Exchange Server with the hidden sharename MAILDAT$.

2. Run the Microsoft Mail Administrator program, Admin.exe, against the shadow
   postoffice and look at the External postoffice definitions. If there is an
   entry for the postoffice you are attempting to connect to, remove this entry.

You should now be able to add a connection for that postoffice in the Microsoft
Mail connector.
