-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you turn off banner pages, printing from MS-DOS-based programs may still
print banner pages.

CAUSE
=====

The program is printing to a UNC printer name instead of to a port.

RESOLUTION
==========

Capture the printer port. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the printer you want to use, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

3. Click the Details tab, and then click the Capture Printer Port button.

4. Click the port to be captured (such as LPT2) and the path to the network
   printer (such as \\ServerName\PrinterShare).

   NOTE: To make this connection available every time Windows 95 is started,
   click the Reconnect At Logon check box to select it.

5. In the printer's properties, in the box that shows the print server and share
   name, look for the entry that shows "LPT<x>," where <x> is the
   port you have captured.

6. Click LPT<x> (\\<Server>\<Printqueue>), and then click
   Apply.

7. Click the Capture tab, disable the banner page setting, and then click OK.
