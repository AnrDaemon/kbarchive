KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Plus! for Kids, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have McAfee WebScan installed on your computer, and you use Microsoft
Plus! For Kids, Protect It! to restrict a family member's access to specific
programs, you may find that everything is restricted. For example, programs you
did not restrict are now restricted.

CAUSE
=====

McAfee WebScan conflicts with Microsoft Plus! For Kids, Protect It! When WebScan
is installed on your computer; all programs will be restricted when you restrict
a user, fully, partially, or not at all, in the "Limit Programs" Protect It!
dialog.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only workaround for this problem is to uninstall McAfee WebScan. To
uninstall WebScan, do the following:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, select McAfee WebScan from the list of
   programs, and then click the Add/Remove button.

4. Remove McAfee WebScan.

Protect It! will now run correctly and restrict restricting those programs that
were designated to be restricted by the Protect It! administrator.
