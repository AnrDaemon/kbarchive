TITLE   :XADM: Database in Inconsistent State After Soft Recovery
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If your system crashes after the Jet database has completed recovery from a
previous crash, but before any subsequent log records are flushed, the database
is in an inconsistent state. A -550 error recorded from source EDB may appear in
the application log.

CAUSE
=====

The RecoveryQuit transaction from the first recovery operation is in the last
log file when another recovery is attempted.


RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the fix described below. Jet's soft recovery was fixed to handle the
existence of a RecoveryQuit transaction in the last log file. This allows the
second recovery to complete.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
