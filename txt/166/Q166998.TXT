======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Postscript print jobs submitted from a Macintosh client to a computer running
Windows NT Server running Services for Macintosh and setup with a Postscript
printer may not print.

CAUSE
=====

To enable the spooler to track jobs from Macintosh clients, an extra line is
prepended to the header information of the print job.


RESOLUTION
==========

The Services for Macintosh print service has been modified so it no longer
tracks jobs using this method. No additions are made to a Postscript job being
sent to a Postscript printer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0 This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
