KEYWORDS:kbtshoot

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your attempts to launch the OS/2-based applications may fail when started as a
service with OS/2 error 1588444941. The error may still occur even though the
application will launch fine in console mode.

CAUSE
=====

The above error indicates a failure loading. This can be because of corruption
in either the application or the OS/2 subsystem files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Try to remove and reinstall the application software before you attempt to
replace the OS/2 subsystem files as corrupt application files are more often the
cause of the error.

To reinstall the OS/2 subsystem use EXPAND.EXE or EXPNDW32.EXE (found in the
Windows NT Resource Kit) for the following files:

   OS2SS.EXE    - %SystemRoot%\System32\ 
   OS2.EXE      - %SystemRoot%\System32\ 
   OS2SRV.EXE   - %SystemRoot%\System32\ 
   NETAPI.DLL   - %SystemRoot%\System32\Os2\Dll\ 
   doscalls.dll - %SystemRoot%\System32\Os2\Dll\ 

Oso001.009 does not need to be expanded, but replace the file in the
%SystemRoot%\System32\Os2\ with a fresh copy.

For steps to remove the OS/2 subsystem registry entries please see the following
