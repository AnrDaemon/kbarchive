PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbhw win95 kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Hewlett-Packard (HP) OfficeJet Series 300 printer driver
and Device Manager software, any attempt to detect new hardware using the Add
New Hardware Wizard may cause a fatal exception error 06, 0E, 0C, or 0D.

CAUSE
=====

The HP OfficeJet Series 300 Device Manager contends with Windows 95 for control
of Plug and Play.

RESOLUTION
==========

Start the Close Program dialog box by pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE. Click HPOJDMAN
in the list of tasks, and then click End Task.


STATUS
======

Contact Hewlett-Packard Technical Support for more information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem occurs only when the HP OfficeJet Series 300 Device Manager
(Hpodjman.exe) is running. The HP installation process sets up a shortcut in the
Startup folder that runs "Hpojdman.exe /AUTOPROMPT." This causes Hpojdman.exe to
run in the background.
