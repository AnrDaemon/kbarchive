TITLE   :XFOR: Msgs With Mixed Japanese Encoding Not Decoded Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Messages received by the Japanese version of Microsoft Exchange Client 5.0 from
the Internet News Service (INS) and Internet Mail Service (IMS) that have mixed
character-set encoding are not decoded correctly. Those portions of the message
not decoded appear as non-standard keyboard characters in the monitor.

These symptoms are seen when the inbound message contains mixed character sets.
For example, if some parts of the inbound message are encoded with JIS, and
others encoded with Shift-JIS, the entire message will not be decoded correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
