PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbusage kbviewer word97 kblayout

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to print a document from Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000 that has
margins set outside the printable area for the current printer, the following
error message appears:

   The margins of section # are set outside the printable area of the page. Do
   you want to continue?

Choosing Yes prints the page with the possibility of having some text cut off.
Choosing No cancels the printing of the document.

You are unable to adjust the margins of the document in Microsoft Word Viewer.

CAUSE
=====

Word Viewer 97-2000 does not have a Page Setup option that allows you to adjust
the margins of the document.

Word Viewer is only for viewing and printing Word documents. To edit a document,
you must use Microsoft Word.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Ignore the Error Message
----------------------------------

Ignore the error by clicking the Continue button.

The document will be printed, but there is a danger that some of the text may be
truncated in the printed version.

Method 2: Open the Document for Editing in Word
-----------------------------------------------

Open the document in Microsoft Word and adjust the margins so that the error does
not occur.

In Word Viewer 97-2000, on the File menu, click Open For Editing. This starts
Microsoft Word, loads the document, and allows you to make changes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most printers cannot print all the way to the edge of the paper due to physical
limitations in the printer and the way it handles the paper.

If you set your document margins closer to the edge of the paper than your
printer is capable of printing, Microsoft Word and Microsoft Word Viewer return
a warning message for each copy you send to the printer.

Most laser printers, such as the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet, cannot print
closer to any edge of the paper than 0.25 inch. Some laser printers, such as the
HP LaserJet Series II, require 0.5-inch margins. DeskJet printers generally
cannot print closer to the bottom edge than .67 inch. Most PostScript and
dot-matrix printers have their own internal printer driver setting for margins.

The unprintable region is determined by the printer that is currently being used.
To correct the margins that are set to close to the edge of the paper, open the
document in Microsoft Word and follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are using the same printer driver that gave you the error in
   Microsoft Word Viewer.

2. In Word, on the File menu, click Page Setup.

3. Click the OK button.

   You see a warning dialog box about the unprintable regions.

4. Click the Fix button.

5. Save and close the document.

You can now open and print the document in Word Viewer without receiving the
error message.
