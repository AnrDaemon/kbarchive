TITLE   :XCON: MTA Work Queue Backlog When Restrictions Used with DL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A backlog in the Microsoft Exchange Server Message Transfer Agent (MTA) may
occur during delivery of specific types of messages. To observe this backlog,
use the Windows NT Performance Monitor to view the MSExchangeMTA counter for
Work Queue Length. This counter may exceed 3,000 and remain there for a long
period of time. This backlog is most likely to occur when there are delivery
restrictions and distribution lists associated with the message.

CAUSE
=====

Large distribution lists and the existence of delivery restrictions can cause
the MTA to enter into CPU and I/O intensive computations.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
