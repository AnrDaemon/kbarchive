TITLE   :XCLN: Mac Attachments Are Unrecognizable After Crossing IMC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A Macintosh attachment in a message comes across as an unrecognizable document
after crossing the Internet Mail Connector (IMC). The message is sent from a
computer running Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) to
a computer running Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client 5.0. Both IMCs are
configured to send attachments in Binhex, always sending rich text.

CAUSE
=====

Macintosh attachments sent from Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 SP3 to Microsoft
Exchange Server 5.0 in Binhex+TNEF are not received properly (wrong icon,
unrecognizable file type, and so on). This is because of the incompatible
Macintosh file handlings for UUENCODE/TNEF between 4.0 SP1 and 5.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
