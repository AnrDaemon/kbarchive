TITLE   :PRB: IME Always Active in Browse Window at VFP Run-Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbvfp kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

"Browse IME Control" can be controlled under General Tab, Option Dialog Box of
the System menu during development. This option specifies that Visual FoxPro
displays an Input Method Editor (IME) when you navigate to a text box in the
Browse window, a TextBox control, or a Grid control under Double- Byte Character
Set (DBCS) operating system environment. But this option is always enabled
during runtime, which means, the IME window is always active when a TextBox
control get its focus, regardless whether the content of the text box is
double-byte characters or not. In Visual FoxPro 6.0, you may use the new
introduced "Set BrowseIME" to determine your desired behavior.

NOTE: By default, "Set BrowseIME" is set to "ON" under Triditional/Simplified
Chinese windows, and "OFF" under Korean Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. The TextBox control: Specifies the <Control>.IMEMode property to
   desired setting of the IME status. 0(Default) - No control, 1 - open IME and
   2 - Close IME.

2. TextBox in a Grid control: Specifies IMEStatus() function in Column.Gotfocus
   event to control the proper setting of the input field. Imestatus(0) turns
   the IME window off and Imestatus(1) turns the IME back on.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
