TITLE   :PRB: No Workspace or Project Files Found in Selected SCC Project
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600 kbVC500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to open a project in Developer Studio from Source Control you
may receive the following error:

   No workspace or project files were found in the selected source control
   project.

CAUSE
=====

The project is a project from an earlier version of Visual C++. Developer Studio
cannot simultaneously open a project from source control and convert it.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Visual SourceSafe Explorer to get the project. Open the project in
Developer Studio and convert it. Either add the project back to the same
location in the Visual SourceSafe database with Developer Studio, or add the
.dsp and .dsw files to the Visual SourceSafe project with the Visual SourceSafe
Explorer.

Now you can use the source control integration in Developer Studio as expected.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
