TITLE   :BUG: Books Online Index Search Field Finds Incorrect Topic
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The index view in Books Online provides a search field you can use to find a
topic. Books Online scrolls to the appropriate section in the index list when
you quickly type the letters for a desired topic into the search field. However,
if you type slowly into the search field, Books Online scrolls to a section in
the index list, but only for the text displayed in the search field. If you
continue to type slowly, the index list scrolls to a different section for each
of the letters you type and these letters are never displayed in the search
field.

CAUSE
=====

Typing slowly into the search field yields control to the Books Online program
and focus is shifted from the search field. Books Online scrolls to the section
in the index list for the text already in the search field but focus is not
returned. If you continue typing slowly, this loss of focus on the search field
causes each letter to be interpreted separately and the index list to scroll to
a different section for each one. The text in the search field is also not
updated correctly for the same reason.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workarounds are:

 - to type the letters of the desired topic into the search field as quickly as
   possible without any pauses,

-or-

 - to paste the string you are searching for into the search field.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open Books Online. "Books Online..." appears under the Help menu.

2. Switch to the Index by clicking the Index toolbar button or selecting "Index"
   under the View menu.

3. Set focus to the search field by clicking the search field with the mouse.
   The search field is above the index list.

4. Press the "s" key and wait for the index list to scroll to the "S" section.

5. Press the "c" key.

At this point, you would normally expect to see "sc" in the search field and the
"SC" section in the index list. Because the focus did not return to the search
field, the "c" key press causes the index list to jump to the "C" section of the
index list instead of the desired "SC" section.
