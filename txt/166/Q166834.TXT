TITLE   :Lost Record Locks from MS-DOS-based Program to NetWare Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An MS-DOS-based application that does record locking on file(s) located on a
Novell NetWare server may experience problems if it shells out of the
application while the locks are held. For example, the application may be
prematurely terminated when it tries to close the locks it originally opened.

CAUSE
=====

If the shell application takes any action that would cause its own record locks
to be closed, the locks held by the parent application are also closed. NWRDR
does not maintain the locks held by the parent application in this scenario.

RESOLUTION
==========

Avoid shelling out of MS-DOS-based applications that open files on NetWare
servers or obtain an updated version of Nwrdr.sys.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
