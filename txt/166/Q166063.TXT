PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbdta kbviewer word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you open a document in Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000 and then open that same
document in Microsoft Word (while it is still open in Word Viewer), Microsoft
Word opens the document as read-only.

Microsoft Word should open the document as read-write because Word Viewer cannot
make changes to the document.

WORKAROUND
==========

Close the document in Word Viewer. You can now open the document as read- write
in Microsoft Word.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word opens a document as read-only if the document is already open
somewhere else. The first program to open the document gets read-write
privileges.
