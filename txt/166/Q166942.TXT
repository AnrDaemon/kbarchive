The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a document in Word 97 containing text formatted for bullets or
numbering, when you open the document in Word 6.0 or Word 7.0 (95), the
"Distance from text" for the bulleted or numbered text has changed from the
original distance from text created in Word 97.

For example, the following bulleted list

   * Line one
     * Line two
       * Line three

will result with an increased bullet-to-text indent when the file is opened in
Word 6.0 or Word 7.0 as follows:

   * Line one.
     *       Line two
       *             Line three

NOTE: This problem occurs regardless of whether you save the document as Word
6.0/95 or if you open the Word 97 document in either Word 6.0 or Word 7.0.

CAUSE
=====

The bulleted or numbered text has been formatted using any of the List Bullet or
List Number styles.

WORKAROUND
==========

Instead of using the List Bullet or List Number styles, format your text using
the bullets and numbering commands (on the Format menu or the Formatting
toolbar). Then, apply indentation using the Increase Indent or Decrease Indent
toolbar buttons.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to open a Word 97 document in an earlier version of Word (6.x and 7.x),
you must use a converter.
