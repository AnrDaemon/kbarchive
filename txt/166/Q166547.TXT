TITLE   :XCLN: Mac Client Will Not Launch on PowerMacs Without Easy Open
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client is unable to run on a Power Macintosh if
the Control Panel Macintosh Easy Open (or Mac OS Easy Open) is not installed.
This issue does not affect the 68-KB Macintosh, only the PowerMac Microsoft
Exchange Macintosh client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following error message appears when you try to start the Microsoft Exchange
Macintosh client without Macintosh Easy Open installed on a PowerMac:

   The application "Microsoft Exchange & Schedule+" could not be opened
   because "Translation" could not be found.

To workaround this problem, Easy Open (either Macintosh and/or Mac OS) must be
loaded during startup. To ensure that Easy Open is loaded during startup, do one
of the following:

 - In Control Panel, Extensions Manager, select Macintosh Easy Open and/or Mac
   OS Easy Open, and then restart.

   -OR-

1. From the finder, go to the System folder.

2. Make sure that the Control Panel(s) Macintosh Easy Open and/or Mac OS Easy
   Open is present in the System Folder, Control Panels folder, and then reboot.

   -OR-

 - Easy Open may not be present in the System Folder or any of its subfolders.
   To install Easy Open you will need to re-install the Macintosh Operating
   System.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh
client, version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange
