TITLE   :PRB: SQLSetDescField Appears to Call Itself
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When SQLSetDescField is called, the ODBC 3.0 trace log may show two calls made
to SQLSetDescField. The second call to SQLSetDescField may be embedded within
the first, giving the appearance that SQLSetDescField called itself.

CAUSE
=====

SQLSetDescField uses a helper function that has an extra copy of the trace
function found in SQLSetDescField. This causes SQLSetDescField to show up twice
in the trace log, giving the appearance that SQLSetDescField called itself.

WORKAROUND
==========

Ignore the second call to SQLSetDescField in the trace log.
