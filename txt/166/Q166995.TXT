The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Even though new mail notification has been enabled, you may not be notified of
each new incoming message.

CAUSE
=====

By product design, the Microsoft Exchange Client is hardcoded to wait two
minutes between displaying the new mail notification window. This design was
based on customer feedback from the Microsoft Exchange Server beta program. This
value cannot be modified.

RESOLUTION
==========

An Inbox rule can be created that will display a pop-up dialog box for every
incoming message. For this message to display properly, the rule must be
profile-specific, which means an identical rule needs to be created on any
computer running Microsoft Exchange Client.

To initiate notification of every incoming e-mail message, perform the following
steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Inbox Assistant.

2. In the Inbox Assistant dialog box, click Add Rule.

3. In the Edit Rule dialog box, click to select the Alert With check box, and
   then click Action.

4. In the Alert Actions dialog box, click to select the Notify With The Text or
   the Play check box, if it is not already selected.

   If you select Notify With The Text, type the text to be displayed in the
   notification dialog box.

   If you select Play, click Sound, choose the sound file to be played, and then
   click Test.

5. Click OK to close all dialog boxes.

NOTE: You can enable new mail notification by clicking Options on the Tools menu,
clicking the General tab, and then selecting "When new mail arrives, display a
notification message."
