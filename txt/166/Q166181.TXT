SUMMARY
=======

When you use Word as your email editor, Word does not allow you to insert page
numbers into your email message. This article describes how to insert page
numbers in an email message by using a Visual Basic for Applications macro.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The page numbers that you will insert into your email message will be
visible only when you or the recipient is using WordMail and while you or the
recipient is using page layout view. The page numbers will be printed when you
or the recipient prints the email message.

1. Start Word.

2. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Record New Macro.

3. In the Macro name box, type a name for the macro. For example, type
   "InsertPageNumbers" (without the quotation marks).

4. In the Store Macro In list, select "All Documents (Normal.dot)."

5. Click OK.

   The macro recorder starts and the Stop Recording toolbar appears.

6. On the View menu, click Header And Footer. The insertion point appears in the
   header. If you want the page numbers in the footer, click the "Switch Between
   Header and Footer" button on the Header And Footer toolbar.

7. Position the insertion point where you want to place the page number. For
   example, press TAB one time if you want the page number to be centered, or
   press TAB two times if you want the page number to be right-aligned.

8. Type any text you want to appear before the page number, and then click the
   Page Number button on the Header And Footer toolbar.

9. Click the Close button on the Header And Footer toolbar.

10. Click the Stop Recording button on the Stop Recording toolbar.

   NOTE: The InsertPageNumbers macro is now stored in the Normal.dot template.
   It will be available any time you create a document in Word. If you want the
   macro to be available only to email documents, use the Organizer to move the
   macro from the Normal.dot template to the E-mail.dot template.

11. Start Microsoft Outlook and set Word as your email editor:
   a. On the Tools menu, click Options.

   b. On the E-mail tab, click to select the "Use Microsoft Word as the e-mail
      editor" check box.

   c. Click OK.

12. Compose your email message.

13. Insert the page numbers using the recorded macro:
   a. Place the insertion point in the text area of your email message.

   b. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

   c. In the Macro list box, select the InsertPageNumbers macro, and then click
      Run.
