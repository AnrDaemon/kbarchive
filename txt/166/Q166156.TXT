text of the message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To modify the message received by the Exchange accounts. To do this perform the
following steps.

1. Make a backup of the Pabmsg.txt file. This file can be found on the computer
   running Microsoft Exchange Server, in the <Exchange Server>\Bin
   directory.

2. Open the Pabmsg.txt file. (If the file does not already exist, create this
   file.)

3. Modify this text file as you want, and save. Save this file as a text file,
   and use the same name and location.

4. Run the migration wizard to migrate the PABs. (If you would like to test the
   change, it is recommended that you migrate one test user.)

For information on the migration Wizard, please see the Exchange Server CD,
Migrate\Docs. The Readme.txt explains what each document contains.
