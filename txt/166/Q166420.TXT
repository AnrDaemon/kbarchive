SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 Domain Name Service (DNS) Manager shows 2 identical entries for
the x.x.in-addr.arpa zone.

DNS Manager will show a double entry in x.x.in-addr.arpa zone, if more than 29
PTR records are defined. This entry appears only once in the x.x.in-
addr.arpa.dns file.

Functionality is not affected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.00. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: duplicate dnsmgr reverse name lookup
