TITLE   :BUG: "One-time Only" Tracing Option Does Not Stop Automatically
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG #: 4559 (odbc3)

SYMPTOMS
========

One of the ODBC Driver Manager 3.0 tracing options, One-time Only, does not
automatically stop tracing after the first traced ODBC application is
disconnected from the database or shut down. The ODBC tracing utility keeps
tracing for any subsequent ODBC applications.

WORKAROUND
==========

After the traced ODBC application stops, the button in the ODBC Administrator
changes from Stop Tracing Now to Start Tracing Now, and the option changes from
One-time Only to Don't Trace under the When to Trace group.

You need to click Start Tracing Now and click the Stop Tracing Now button again
to actually stop the tracing.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Open Database
Connectivity version 3.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
