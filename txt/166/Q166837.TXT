KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When a remote control session is established by a user whose user name contains a
space, as in "FirstName LastName," the Remote Control Permissions dialog box on
the system being remote controlled will display the either of the following:

 - Will you allow "FirstName" to LastName?

-or-

 - Will you allow "FirstName" to ?? Unknown prompt from server?

The message that should be displayed is

   Will you allow "FirstName LastName" to Remote Control your machine?

where "FirstName LastName" is the Windows NT User Name of the account that is
attempting remote control.

A user logged on with a User Name of one word who has a Full Name of two words
with a space, will also produce the same error on the client computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Remote Control Permissions dialog box on the client displays correctly and
completely if the Remote Controlling user's name is only one word.
