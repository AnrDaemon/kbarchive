KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbSSafe kbVisID kbVisID100 kbVisID600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual InterDev, versions 1.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Users that are allowed read-only access to a Visual SourceSafe (VSS) project,
but have been entered as Administrators to the FrontPage Web project can disable
source control for the Web project, giving them full control over the project.

CAUSE
=====

Visual InterDev allows all project administrators to enable or disable source
control.

RESOLUTION
==========

Only users allowed to enable or disable source control should be given
administrator level access to the Web project.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

User rights for the Web project can be modified by selecting Web Permissions
from the Project menu, while VSS user rights must be changed within the Visual
SourceSafe Administrator utility.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Web project.

2. Enable source control for the project.

3. Give user X Read-only VSS access to the project.

4. Give user X Administrator rights to the FrontPage Web project.

5. Have user X open the Web project in Visual InterDev.

6. In Visual InterDev version 1.0, do a Project/Disable Source Control. In
   version 6.0, go to Source Control under Project and select Disconnect Web
   Project.
