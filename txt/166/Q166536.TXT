PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message designated for deferred delivery, the message transfer
agent (MTA) may generate an error message resembling the following:

   MSExchangeMTA
   Event ID: 2187
   MSExchangeMTA event ID: 2187
   An MTA database server error was encountered while attempting to unlock
   an object which is not locked. Called from MTA. Procedure XX. Object at
   fault: XXXXXXXX.

CAUSE
=====

The source object for a deferred delivery message is locked twice and then
unlocked once. The first unlock leaves the object in an unlocked state. When a
second unlock attempt is made, the error message appears.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
