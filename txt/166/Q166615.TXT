TITLE   :XFOR: Message Characters Corrupted When Different Locale Used
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a computer running Microsoft Exchange Client or a POP3 client is configured
with a different code page than the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0 uses to send a MIME-encoded message, the message body becomes
corrupted.

An example of this scenario is when the Microsoft Exchange Server computer is
configured with standard settings (US-ASCII for POP3, ISO-8859-1 for the
Internet Mail Service) and the client being used has another code page
installed.

CAUSE
=====

The message body becomes corrupted because the MIME header does not match the
message body type. This will affect all outbound MIME messages where the code
page on the server differs from the client locale.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
