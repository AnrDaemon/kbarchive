TITLE   :XCON: MTA Stops Responding; Access Violation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) stops responding and
the following is reported in the Dr. Watson log:

   Application exception occurred:
      App: emsmta.DBG (pid=275)
      When: 3/11/1997 @ 9:16:16.178
      Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

CAUSE
=====

This is a client/server issue; the wrong data is being picked up from the X.400
API (XAPI) call. This causes the MTA to stop responding.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

This problem does not occur in Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0.
