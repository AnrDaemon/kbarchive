KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprintkbbuglist kbfixlist

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt from a Windows NT computer to connect to an AT&T Advanced Server
for a VMS or OSF printer share fails.

CAUSE
=====

The AT&T Advanced Server for UNIX is a Windows NT server on a UNIX network
environment. Windows NT computers view the print provider of the AT&T
Advanced Server for UNIX as a downlevel print server (for example, a LAN Manager
2.x print server.) The AT&T Advanced Server for UNIX provides full server
functionality except for the print server functionality (SpoolSS) to Windows NT
computers.


RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the hotfix mentioned below.
