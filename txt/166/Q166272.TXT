SYMPTOMS
========

When you update a formula field in a table, the result is incorrect if the
following are true:

 - The number of summed rows in the table is greater than 85.

   -and-

 - The range specified in the formula is (ABOVE) or (BELOW).

NOTE: The SUM and COUNT formulas can use the (ABOVE) and (BELOW) ranges.

When you use a Visual Basic for Applications procedure that uses the AutoSum
Method to insert the formula field, the following error appears in place of the
formula field when the number of summed rows total more than 85:

   !Unexpected End of Formula

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when a finite length string is overrun because too many
cells are referenced in the formula. The field =Sum(Above) is translated to
=Sum(a1+b1+c1...) and eventually it gets too long for the string.


WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following methods to workaround this problem:

Method 1  - Specify a range cell reference in the formula
---------------------------------------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the View tab.

2. Under Show, click to select the Field Codes check box.

3. Click OK.

   The formula field looks similar to the following:

   {=Sum(Above)}

4. Type a cell reference in the field. Change your field so that it looks
   similar to the following:

   {=Sum(A1:A87)}

   where A1 and A87 represent the first and last cells in the range.

5. Press F9.

   The field updates.

6. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the View tab.

7. Under Show, click to clear the Field Codes check box.

8. Click OK.

Method 2
--------

Create subtotals, and then reference the subtotals to create a grand total.

Method 3
--------

Use Excel to calculate totals.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Word 2000.
