TITLE   :XFOR: DXA Doesn't Export New Recipients Container During Dirsync
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you add a new recipients container to the list of Exported Containers for
either a Dirsync Requester object or Remote Dirsync Requester object, some names
in the new recipients container may not be sent in the next directory
synchronization (dirsync) cycle as expected.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization service (DXA) did not always
handle this properly.

Every object within a Microsoft Exchange Directory has a USN-Changed value. This
value is updated every time that the object is modified. The USN- Changed value
is what the DXA uses to determine if an object that it is synchronizing with
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks has changed since the last dirsync cycle.

When a new recipients container is added to the list of Exported Containers, the
DXA should look for all objects with a USN-Changed value greater than zero
within that new recipients container and send those objects out as dirsync
transactions. Due to a logic error in the DXA, the DXA was treating the new
recipients container as if it had always been in the list of export containers.


WORKAROUND
==========

DXA Is Acting as Dirsync Server
-------------------------------

If the DXA is acting as the dirsync server, each remote dirsync requester must
request a full import from the DXA. This can be accomplished by performing
either of the following two procedures.

Procedure 1 - Use the Admin.exe Utility:

1. Start the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Admin.exe utility against the
   Requester postoffice that is now expecting the new recipients container.

2. Select Config, Dirsync, Requester, Import, and YES.

Repeat these two steps for each requester postoffice expecting the new containers
Recipients to be sent.

Procedure 2 - Use the Exchange Administrator Program:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

2. Highlight the Remote Requester object, open the File menu, and click
   Properties.

3. On the General tab, select the Export on Next Cycle checkbox.

Repeat these three steps for each Remote Requester object expecting the new
containers recipients to be sent.

DXA Is Acting as a Dirsync Requester
------------------------------------

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

2. Highlight the Remote Requester object, open the File menu, and click
   Properties.

3. On the General tab, select the Export on Next Cycle checkbox.
