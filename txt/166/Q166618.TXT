TITLE   :XADM: Batch Export Crashes When Non Zero ulUSNBase is Specified
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you run a batch export in Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0, the
Directory Service may abort operation.

CAUSE
=====

If BatchExport is called with non-zero ulUSNBase, the data structure used to
build the filter object for passing to the Directory Service is missing a field
(size). This causes the filter to be built with a NULL value, which results in
an error on the ds_search. The error handling routines then attempt to access
the current Attribute/Value tables, which don't exist for BatchExport.

This behavior will not occur when you use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program. The export command in the Administrator program does not provide an
option to set the ulUSNBase to not zero.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
