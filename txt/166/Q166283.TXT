TITLE   :Cannot Install RIP for Internet Protocol
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Routing tab in TCP/IP properties is open, you may receive the following
message:

   IP forwarding (IP Routing) allows packets to be forwarded on a multi-
   homed system. The routing information may be static, or may be
   collected by RIP for Internet Protocol. RIP is a service that can be
   installed from the Network Control Panel service page.

However, when you check the Services tab in Network properties, you do not see
RIP for Internet Protocol.

CAUSE
=====

RIP for Internet Protocol is not available in Windows NT Workstation unless you
install SP4. It is available in Windows NT Server only.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to Windows NT Server, use a static route table, or obtain and install
SP4. For information about how to do so, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE- ID: Q172514
   TITLE : Silent RIP for IP Available for Windows NT Workstation

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is a documentation error. The RIP for Internet Protocol service that is
referred to on the Routing tab is used to allow dynamic routing with TCP/IP.
This service is a component of Windows NT Server 4.0, and is not included with
Windows NT Workstation 4.0.

You cannot use dynamic routing with Windows NT Workstation. However, static IP
routing can be enabled in Windows NT Workstation. The routing tables must be
manually established by using the ROUTE command to create the static routing
table on a multihomed computer.

To view the message, perform the following steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. Click the Protocols tab.

3. Double-click the TCP/IP protocol.

4. Click the Routing tab.
