TITLE   :BUG: Option Button in Export Dialog Box Causes Error Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbHWMAC kbvfpkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Choosing the Option button in the Export dialog when attempting to export a
table contained within a database causes one of two error messages to appear:

   .DBC Internal Consistency Error

   -or-

   Cannot find object in database.

However, if you simply choose a table from a database, pick a file type from the
Type list box, and type a name in the To list box, all the records in the table
export properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the EXPORT command by typing it in the Command window or running it from a
program. For instance, to copy the first 10 records of the Products table into
an Excel 4.0 worksheet, use the following syntax:

      USE HOME()+"\Samples\data\Products.dbf"
      EXPORT TO Ztest.xls TYPE XLS FOR RECNO()<11

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Options button normally reveals a dialog box that allows you to set filters
that control which records or fields are exported.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Type "CLOSE ALL" (without the quotation marks) in the Command window.

2. Select Export from the File menu.

3. In the Export dialog box, click the button to the right of the "From" field.

4. Navigate to the Samples\Data folder and select Products.dbf.

5. Click OK.

6. In the Export dialog box, click Options.
