 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange 5.0 Active Server Pages components do not support file
version numbers. When you install a service pack or upgrade to a new version of
Microsoft Exchange Server, the entire Webdata directory is renamed to
Webdata.000, and a new Webdata directory is created. Any scripting changes made
to the default script files included with Microsoft Exchange Server will need to
be updated manually after the upgrade has taken place.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you upgrade an existing Microsoft Exchange Server installation to a service
pack or a new version, the install process does a check for every file to be
installed. It checks to ensure the file exists and then to ensure that the file
to be installed is not older than the existing file itself.

Microsoft Exchange Server Active Server Pages are primarily script files, open to
modification by the administrator or other personnel. Because these script files
may contain custom code, the whole directory is copied to prevent data loss.

If any of the Active Server Pages script files for Microsoft Exchange Server were
modified before the upgrade, the administrator will need to re- apply these
changes to the scripts which are now resident in the Webdata directory in order
to match any changes they may have made by customizing their scripts.
