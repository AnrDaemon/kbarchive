SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how you can display a graphic on each tab of a SSTab
ActiveX control at run time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SSTab control is an ActiveX control that ships with Visual FoxPro 5.x. The
SSTab control provides a group of tabs, each of which acts as a container for
other controls.

The steps below demonstrate how to create an example of one of these controls:

1. Create a form.

2. Add the SSTab ActiveX control to the form. By default, SSTab always has three
   pages.

3. Change the name of the control from Olecontrol1 to SStab1.

4. Add a Command button to the form and change the Caption property to "Set
   Picture."

5. In the Click method of the Command button, put in the following code:

         FOR cPage = 0 to 2
              THISFORM.SSTab1.Object.Tab = cPage   &&select the current page
              THISFORM.SSTab1.Object.Picture = ;
                  LoadPicture(home()+"samples\graphics\bmps\outline\leaf.bmp")
              ** In Visual FoxPro 6.0, change the LoadPicture() function to:
              ** LoadPicture(Home()+"Fox.bmp")
         ENDFOR
         THISFORM.SSTab1.Object.Tab = 0

6. Save and run the form.

When the form is running, click on the Command button to display the graphic on
each tab.

NOTE: Remember, the tab in SSTab ActiveX control always begins with 0.

The Picture property of the SSTab control requires an object reference, and the
LoadPicture function returns an object reference to the graphic file.

The LoadPicture function supports the bitmap (.bmp), icon (.ico), or Windows
metafile (.wmf) graphical formats.
