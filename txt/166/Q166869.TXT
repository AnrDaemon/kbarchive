TITLE   :XADM: EDBUTIL Uses Exchange Bin Directory for Tempdfrg.edb
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

EDBUTIL uses the Microsoft Exchange Server Bin directory for defragmentation and
repair. If Exchange Server is installed on a disk drive with insufficient disk
space to accommodate the Tempdfrg.edb, the EDB file will be truncated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Edbutil reads from the source .edb file and writes to the destination .edb file.
After the source .edb file reaches end-of-file, the destination is copied over
the source .edb file.

If the Exchange Server Bin directory does not have adequate space, EDBUTIL
continues to read from the source .edb file, even though EDBUTIL cannot write to
the destination .edb file. This causes the final .edb file to appear corrupt and
unusable.

For example, Exchange Server is running on drive C, which has 100 MB of free disk
space; drive D has 5 GB free space. Priv.edb is 2 GB. If you run EDBUTIL without
specifying the Tempdfrg.edb path, Priv.Edb will be truncated to about 100 MB.

To assure Tempdfrg.edb is placed on the drive with adequate free space:

 - Use the /T<DRIVE:>PATH switch:

   EDBUTIL /D /ISPRIV /TC:\MYDIRECTORY\TEMPDFRG.EDB

   The tempdfrg.edb can be <any name>.edb

Additional query words: won't start corruption filesize
