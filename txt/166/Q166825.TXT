TITLE   :XADM: Containers Sorted by Directory Name in GAL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0;WINDOWS:4.0;Win95:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs when you are using Microsoft Exchange Client connecting to a
computer running Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0. When you view containers in the
address book, the sort order of the containers is based on the directory name
instead of the display name. The sort order is correct in the Exchange Server
Administrator program; the containers are sorted by display name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur in Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. When you
view the address book from a 4.0 or 5.0 client connecting to the 5.0 server, you
see the containers sorted correctly by Display Name.

Additional query words: global list display distinguished GAL
