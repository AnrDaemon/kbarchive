KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A new public folder created by an Internet News feed in Microsoft Exchange
Server version 5.0, defaults to Character Set US ASCII, regardless of Windows NT
locale setting.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

This does not affect existing stores and folders. After you apply Service Pack
1, a new public store will determine the character set based on the Windows NT
locale setting. If the root Internet Newsgroups public folder has the correct
character set, new sub-folders that you create will inherit the character set
value from the root.
