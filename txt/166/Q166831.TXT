 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 
 - Microsoft Active Server Pages, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In order to successfully perform a query using Internet Database Connector (IDC)
or Active Server Pages (ASP) to an Microsoft Access 95 or 97 database (.mdb)
located on a Novell server, you must have Gateway Services for NetWare installed
and properly configured on the Internet Information Server (IIS) computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Install Gateway Services for NetWare via Control Panel Networks.

2. In Control Panel GSNW, click Gateway and enable the gateway. By default, this
   is not enabled.

3. Create shares to the .mdb and .mdw (for secure access databases). Typically
   the .mdw will be on another share or drive.

Once the above is done, you will not need to map these drives in the login script
that you run during the logon to the Windows NT Server. Clients should then be
able to successfully query to the Microsoft Access database.
