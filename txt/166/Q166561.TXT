TITLE   :XFOR: CCMC Not Handling Bad Messages Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the Lotus cc:Mail Export utility version 6.0 exports messages with
Macintosh file attachments, the exported file is malformed. When you read this
malformed file, the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail stops
responding, a Dr. Watson is generated, or the message is sent without
attachments but the message is never passed to the bad directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

A fix for this problem with the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail
is planned for Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1). The "bad"
messages will be placed in the "bad" directory and/or an event will be logged by
Connector for cc:Mail to indicate that a "bad" message was received.
