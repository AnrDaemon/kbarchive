TITLE   :PRB: Err: "Variable Not Found" Attempting to Export
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbHWMAC kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to export the fields from a table to another table or another
format, you may get the following message:

   Variable <some variable name> is not found.

The variable name referenced is probably not in any of the source tables.

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro is creating the COPY TO command incorrectly. It is truncating the
list of fields and then adding the appropriate keyword for the export file type
to the end of the command line (for example, DBF).

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the COPY command that is echoed to the Command window so that it correctly
lists the fields.

-or-

If you are trying to copy all fields from a single table, do not use the "Fields"
option in the Export Options dialog box. The Export dialog box (and COPY TO
command) copy all fields, by default.

-or-

If you are using multiple tables, create a query to create the new file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available. This works correctly in FoxPro
2.6a for Macintosh.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open both the customer and orders table (located in the Samples:Data folder
   in the Visual FoxPro folder.

2. Select Export from the File menu.

3. Type "TEST" (without the quotation marks) in the "To:" text box.

4. Click Options to display the Export Options dialog box.

5. Click Fields to display the Field Picker dialog box.

6. Select "customer" in the "From Table" pop-up list. Click All to select all
   the fields from the customer table.

7. Select "orders" in the "From Table" pop-up list. Click All to select all the
   fields from the orders table.

8. Click OK in the Field Picker dialog box.

9. Click OK in the Export Options dialog box.

10. Click OK in the Export dialog box.

The following error occurs:

   Variable 'TO_NAMEDBF' is not found.

Note that this field does not exist in either table. ("DBF" is appended to the
end of the command to represent the type of the file being created.) Also note
that the field list is not complete.
