TITLE   :Can't Use Fully Qualified LU Name in Print Session Properties
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The APPC tab in the Print Session Properties dialog box will not allow a user to
exit the dialog box unless the Local LU Alias is entered. This prevents the user
from using Fully Qualified LU names.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix is available to correct this problem. To resolve this problem, obtain the
hotfix mentioned below.

NOTE: In order to use the Fully Qualified Name you must do the following:

1. Select the Remote APPC LU alias in the drop down list. This must be done
   first because the Local LU Alias depends on what is selected in the Remote
   APPC LU Alias field.

2. Select the Local LU Alias.

3. Select the Fully Qualified Name radio button and fill in the Fully Qualified
   Name value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
