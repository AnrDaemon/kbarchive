PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to load the remote control agent on a computer running Windows 95
with an STB Lightspeed 128 graphics card and STB drivers (without Vision 95,
STB's graphics manager), the screen blacks out and the monitor goes into power
save mode. You must restart the system to recover.

With Vision 95 loaded, the failure occurs when you exit the remote control agent.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the Tseng ET-4000 driver with the STB card.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
