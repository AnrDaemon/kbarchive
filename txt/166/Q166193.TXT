SUMMARY
=======

The ColorFrm sample demonstrates adding a popup toolbar to an ActiveX Control.
ColorFrm uses a CMiniFrameWnd derived class to contain the toolbar that is
visible whenever the control is UI Active. When the control is no longer active,
the toolbar is hidden and its position is saved.

The ColorFrm sample details which COleControl functions must be overridden to
achieve this behavior. The sample also demonstrates some other basic ActiveX
Control functionality, such as an OnDraw function that renders differently based
on the AmbientUserMode of the control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is often useful to add a popup toolbar to an ActiveX Control that can be used
to provide a user interface to the control. In most cases, you do not want the
toolbar to be visible if the control is not UI Active because there may be other
controls on the dialog or form. The ColorFrm sample demonstrates how to add a
CMiniFrameWnd class and toolbar to an ActiveX Control.

The steps listed below outline the process used to create a popup toolbar that
hides itself when its parent control is not UI Active:

1. Create a basic ActiveX Control using the ControlWizard.

2. Add a new class to the control project that is derived from CMiniFramWnd. An
   object of this class will contain the toolbar.

3. Create the CMiniFrameWnd derived object in the OnCreate function for the
   ActiveX Control.

4. Insert a toolbar resource into the ActiveX Control project.

5. Override OnCreate for the CMiniFrameWnd derived class and use LoadFrame() to
   create the toolbar.

6. Override the functions listed below to achieve the desired showing / hiding
   behavior for the toolbar. Please refer to the sample code for more details.

      - OnShowToolBars()

      - OnHideToolBars()
