SYMPTOMS
========

When you save an ActiveX Document that does not use compound files from Internet
Explorer functioning as an ActiveX Document Container, the file will be saved in
compound document format. Subsequent attempts to load the file in Internet
Explorer results in the exception "Unexpected File Format."

Microsoft Binder will not load the document.

CAUSE
=====

The MFC ActiveX Document Server classes normally require compound file support.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add a call to EnableCompoundFile(TRUE) in the document constructor:

      CScribDoc::CScribDoc()
      {
           // ...
           EnableCompoundFile(TRUE);
      }

MORE INFORMATION
================

Creating a new ActiveX Document server or regular OLE embedding server in
AppWizard selects compound file support by default. The assertion problem occurs
if compound file support was deselected when the project was initially created.
