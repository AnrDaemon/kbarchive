TITLE   :XFOR: NDR from cc:Mail w/ "Header Buffer Full" Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message addressed to a large number of recipients from Microsoft
Exchange Server to Lotus cc:Mail, you may receive a non-delivery report (NDR)
from the cc:Mail Connector. This NDR contains the following string:

   Header Buffer Full.

CAUSE
=====

Lotus cc:Mail imposes a 4-KB header limit on messages. Because of this
limitation, any messages passed to cc:Mail with more than 4 KB in the header
will be returned to the sender in the form of an NDR. The string "Header Buffer
Full" may also be repeated for each additional recipient that goes beyond the
4-KB header limit. This header limit is a set limitation of cc:Mail and cannot
be changed with the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Re-send the mail to fewer recipients.


MORE INFORMATION
================

warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
