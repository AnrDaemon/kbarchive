SYMPTOMS
========

When adding more than 25 dialout devices under Windows NT 4.0 RAS, the NBTSTAT
command will return the following message:

   Unable to access NBT driver; Unknown Error

LMHosts resolution will fail; however, all other resolution methods (such as such
WINS, Domain Name Service (DNS), broadcast) will succeed.

This problem is because NBTSTAT is not reading the entire contents of a registry
key.
