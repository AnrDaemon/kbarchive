TITLE   :FIX: C1001 from Conditional Operator in Initializer
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode kbtool kbCompiler kbVC500bug kbVS97sp1fixkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Use of the conditional operator in the member initialization list may cause the
following error:

   test.cpp(20) : fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
   (compiler file 'E:\utc\src\\P2\main.c', line 379)
   Please choose the Technical Support command on the Visual C++ Help menu, or
   open the Technical Support help file for more information

RESOLUTION
==========

Initialize the members in the function code instead of in the initialization
list.

   -or-

Modify the order in which the variables are declared. For example, with the
following sample the error only occurs if you attempt to initialize the second
variable rather than the first variable.

STATUS
======

beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual Studio 97
