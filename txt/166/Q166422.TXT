======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

A MicroChannel network interface card installed in an IBM 520 Server with a dual
PCI and MicroChannel bus will not start properly and lists the following in the
event log:

   Event ID:    7000
   Source:      Service Control Manager
   Description: The <name of driver> service failed to start due to the
                following error: A device attached to the system is not
                functioning.

CAUSE
=====

This may occur if the network card driver's installation routine incorrectly
sets the BusType registry key to 5 (PCI) rather than to 3 (MicroChannel). This
key is located in:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\xxxy
\Parameters

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

   BusType:REG_DWORD:value

Where xxx is the driver name and y is the driver instance.


RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE), find the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\xxxy\Parameters

   Where xxx is the driver name and y is the driver instance.

2. Select the Parameters key.

3. Find and double-click the following Value Name:

   Bustype:REG_DWORD:0x5

4. Change the value to 0x3.

5. Click OK and quit Registry Editor.

6. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.
