TITLE   :XCON: Messages not Being Delivered Over the First Association
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) has a backlog of messages
(up to the default threshold) waiting to be delivered. The MTA makes an
association with another LAN-MTA (RPC connection), but does not deliver mail
over this connection.

CAUSE
=====

The MTAs on both sides of the connection detect that the opposite MTA has the
Turn to send messages. Because of this confusion, neither side sends messages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service

MORE INFORMATION
================

The initiating MTA has passed the Turn to the receiving MTA, but the receiving
MTA does not get it because the association is lost (for whatever reason). When
the initiating MTA recovers the association and asks for the Turn back, the
receiving MTA ignores this request because it does not believe it has the Turn.
Therefore, no one has the Turn and no messages will be sent.

After the message threshold has been reached (default value is 50), the MTAs will
make a new association and begin delivering messages.
