Using Visual Basic for Applications, you can move the insertion point or
selection to a specific table cell.

The following sample macro moves the selection to the second row and third column
of the first table in the document. When the macro completes the first line of
code, the entire cell will be highlighted (selected). The second line,
Selection.Collapse, changes the selection to a insertion point at the beginning
of the cell.

      Sub GoToTableCell()
         ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Cell(Row:=2, Column:=3).Range.Select
         Selection.Collapse
      End Sub
