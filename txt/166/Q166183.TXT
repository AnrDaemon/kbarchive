 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user is attempting to open more than 256 files on a Microsoft File and
Printer Services (FPNW) server, they may receive an indication that too many
files are opened on the remote server.

One such indication might be the following error message:

   Too many files are opened on a remote server. This error should only be
   returned by the NT redirector on a remote drive.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because there is a hardcoded limit of 256 open files per
user.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
