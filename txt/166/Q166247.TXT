TITLE   :XADM: Inproxy.dll Creates Non-RFC Conformant SMTP Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program to create an SMTP
proxy for a Microsoft Exchange Site using substitution characters separated by a
'.', if one of the represented fields is null, Inproxy.dll will generate an
invalid SMTP address. This address works correctly and produces no error
messages or warnings but it does not conform to the RFC.

STATUS

version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post additional
