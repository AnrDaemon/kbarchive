SYMPTOMS
========

In some cases, when you press TAB in a table, the insertion point does not
advance to the next cell.

Case 1
------

1. Create a table with at least two columns in it.

2. Place the insertion point in one of the cells.

3. On the Table menu, click Split Cells.

4. Increase the Number of Rows to at least two.

5. Click OK.

Case 2
------

1. Create a table with at least two columns and two rows in it.

2. Select two vertical cells.

3. On the Table menu, click Merge Cells.

When you use the TAB key to move through the resulting cells, the insertion point
will return to the cell that expands the height of the vertical cells.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design of Microsoft Word. If one cell within a column of a table
extends to the height of at least two vertical cells of another column of the
table, when you press TAB, Word will move the insertion point to the cell that
expands the height of the vertical cells.
