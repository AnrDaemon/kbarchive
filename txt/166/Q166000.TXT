TITLE   :Landscape Orientation Not Available for Generic/Text Only Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to use the option for landscape orientation with the
Generic/Text Only Windows NT printer driver, you may receive blank output.

CAUSE
=====

The Generic/Text Only printer driver does not provide the functionality to print
in landscape orientation. This is true even though the landscape orientation
option is available within the Page Setup menu from the application that is
generating the print job.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT versions
3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.



Additional query words: mode orient printing oriented
