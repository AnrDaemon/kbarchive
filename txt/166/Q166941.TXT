TITLE   :PRB: DblClick Event Fires After Keystroke Followed by Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 3.0x, 5.0x, and 6.0, the DBLCLICK event of a LISTBOX triggers
after any keystroke followed by space. This can cause a problem when performing
an incremental search on a search string that has spaces in between.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DBLCLICK event should only trigger if a double mouse click is performed.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add a list box to the form. Set the RowSourceType property to 1 (Values), and
   RowSource to "AB, A B".

3. Put the following code in the list box DBLCLICK event:

         WAIT WINDOW "DblClick"

4. Save and run the form.

Try to find line "A B" using incremental search, for example, type "A" (without
the quotation marks), then <Space>. The Wait window appears at the
upper-right corner.

NOTE: Even if you do not have code for DBLCLICK event, there is no way to search
for strings with spaces inside.
