TITLE   :WV: Relative Links Don't Work in Word Viewer
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbusage kbviewer

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you click to follow a relative hyperlink that was created with Internet
Assistant, Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000 is unable to parse the link information
and open the document.

Instead, the URL Open dialog box from Internet Explorer is displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when both of the following conditions are true:

 - The hyperlink was created in Internet Assistant, an Internet add-in that you
   can use to create Web pages in earlier versions of Microsoft Word (versions
   earlier than Word 97).

 - The link is a relative link. That is, rather than having a full path to the
   link, the location of the link is relative to the current directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the Internet Explorer URL Open dialog box that is displayed to go to the
linked document.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
