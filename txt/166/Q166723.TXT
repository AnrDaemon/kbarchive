TITLE   :FIX: ATL Object Wizard Prevents Undo Changes
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::2.1,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbATL210bug kbVC500bug kbVC600bug kbATL300bug kbGrpDSMFCATL kbNoUpdatekbbuglis

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL), versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Active Template Library (ATL) Object Wizard to add an object to
the ATL project, you might get a message box informing you that the .idl and
Stdafx.cpp files were modified outside the editor.

If you have edited the file, the work is saved before the wizard changes the
source. One bad side-effect of reloading is that the user cannot undo any
changes previous to the reload.

This mean that if you delete code, then run the ATL object wizard, there is no
way to get back to the original file using undo, and your original file is lost.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an ATL project.

2. Click Finish to create the project.

3. Open the .idl file.

4. Edit the .idl file (for example: change the helpstring).

5. Insert.New ATL Object.

6. Enter the Short Name and click OK.

The message box gets displayed asking you to reload the .idl file. After
reloading, Edit.Undo is not available.
