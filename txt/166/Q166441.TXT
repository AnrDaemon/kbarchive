SUMMARY
=======

This article describes some registry changes that need to be made to get
Informix CLI 32 ODBC drivers to work with Windows NT 4.0 and Internet
Information Server (IIS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

The Informix drivers install only under the current user name of the person that
is logged on to the system. In order to get general access to the drivers for
all users, the registry entries that Informix installed under the logged on
user's account must be copied to the generic users area. Here's how to do this:

1. Using Regedit, search the registry for the word "INFORMIXSERVER" (without the
   quotes).

2. This value and several others resides in a key called "ENVIRONMENT," which is
   a subkey of "INFORMIX."

3. Make a note of all of the values in the key and what they are equal to.

4. Go to HKEY_USERS\DEFAULT\Software and create a new key called "INFORMIX"
   (without the quotes).

5. Create a key under that called "ENVIRONMENT" (without the quotes).

6. Create each of the values and assign them the appropriate information, so
   that the new key looks identical to the old key.

Restart the server for the changes to take effect.
