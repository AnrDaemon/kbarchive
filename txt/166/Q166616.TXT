TITLE   :XFOR: IMS Can Accept RFC821 Addresses Containing an Equal Sign
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

With the release of Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1), the
Internet Mail Service (IMS) can accept a message from an address containing an
equal sign, if you add a registry entry.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe, depending on your version
   of Windows NT).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

      System/CurrentControlSet/Services/MSExchangeIMC/Parameters
 

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry:

      Value Name: AcceptMalformed821Adrs
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
      Value:      1
 

4. Quit Registry Editor.

The Internet Mail Service (IMS) is stricter with regard to RFC 821 compliance
than the Internet Mail Connector (IMC) that shipped with Microsoft Exchange
Server version 4.0.

There is a still a need for the IMS to interoperate with older legacy mail
systems owned by large organizations. For example, this registry setting will be
useful for companies that use systems such as the DEC Ultrix.

DEC Ultrix is manufactured by DEC, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.


STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
