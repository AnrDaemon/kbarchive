TITLE   :Win3x Client Takes 20 Seconds to Display Logon Dialog Box
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Win3x client was installed from the SNA Server 3.0 compact disc, it will
take 20 seconds to display the logon dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server 3.0 Win3.x setup places two backslash characters ("\\") in front
of the remote entry in the Win.ini file if you follow the directions literally
by pressing CTRL+ENTER after you type each server name. For instance, if
Server01 and Server02 were entered by the user during setup, the following entry
would be listed in the Win.ini file:

      [WNAP]
      Remote=\\Server01 \\Server02

It should be:

      [WNAP]
      Remote=Server01 Server02

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix is available to correct this problem. The fix ignores the leading
backslash characters ("\\").

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
