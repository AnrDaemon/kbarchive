OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw osr2 win95 kbHardwarekbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the following conditions are all true, your computer may stop responding
(hang):

 - Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) or 2.1 is installed

 - The computer docking station uses a TI 1131 CardBus controller

 - A SRAM card is inserted into a slot in the docking station

 - A SRAM card is the first card inserted after booting

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of the manner in which the PCCARD driver in OSR2
interacts with the page registers on the TI 1131 CardBus controller.

RESOLUTION
==========


To work around this issue, insert another PC Card device into one of the docking
station's slots before inserting the SRAM card.

STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior has not been reported to occur with docking stations that use the
TI 1130 CardBus controller.
