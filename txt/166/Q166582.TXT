TITLE   :XCLN: Delegates Stop Receiving Schedule+ Meeting Requests
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Schedule+ allows you to grant permission to another user to act as
your delegate. Delegates receive copies of meeting requests sent to you. After
the MBMigrate Resource Kit utility has been used to migrate mailboxes to a new
site, Schedule+ delegates may not receive meeting request messages.

CAUSE
=====

The Resource Kit tool, MBMigrate, is not migrating all information required by
Schedule+.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem follow these steps:

1. Start Schedule+, remove the delegate, and then quit Schedule+ and your mail
   client.

2. Delete and re-create the profile.

3. Start Schedule+ and reset the delegate.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the MBMigrate Resource Kit
utility. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
