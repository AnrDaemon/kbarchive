The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

If you try to run Dskprobe.exe from the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit on a
computer running Windows NT 3.51, you get errors asking for additional DLL files
that are not mentioned in the resource kit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To run the utility Dskprobe.exe from the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit on a
computer running either Windows NT Server 3.51 or Windows NT Workstation 3.51,
you need four files.

You find these files on the Windows NT Server 4.0 or Workstation 4.0 compact
disc, not in the resource kit.

For the x86 platform, these files can be found under the i386 directory:

   MSVCRT40.DLL
   MSVCRT.DLL
   MFC40.DLL
   MSVCIRT.DLL

These files will be compressed on the compact disc. Use the Expand utility to
decompress, rename, and copy these files:

   MSVCRT40.DL_
   MSVCRT.DL_
   MFC40.DL_
   MSVCIRT.DL_

Place all of these files in the same directory and then run the Diskprobe
utility. This allows you to run Dskprobe.exe from the Resource Kit in Windows NT
3.51.
