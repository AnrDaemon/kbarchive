OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send e-mail using the Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 Internet
Mail Service (IMS), the X.400 address may be encapsulated into the Mail From
field.

This occurs when a DDA is specified on the sending mailbox's X.400 address with
type: MSXCX500. This occurs even if a valid SMTP proxy address is specified for
the mailbox.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
