TITLE   :XFOR: MIME and UUENCODED Messages Cause Store Conversion Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A message sent from an Internet Mail client to a computer running Microsoft
Exchange Server may cause the information store (IS) to generate a conversion
error and return the message with a non-delivery report (NDR). It may also cause
the IS service to terminate.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when a message received by the IS from the IMAIL client
is using a foreign character set in the message that is also supported by an
installed code page on the Microsoft Exchange Server.

The message comes in, and Microsoft Exchange Server calls upon a conversion
routine to change the message to MDBEF format. When the conversion routine runs,
it checks to see the installed code pages on the server and incorrectly uses one
that matches the client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
