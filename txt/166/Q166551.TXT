SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the Microsoft Exchange message transfer agent (MTA),
it fails during the rebuild of the gateway address routing table (GWART).

This happens when two computers running Microsoft Exchange Server are sending
e-mail and directory replication messages across an Internet Mail Service (IMS)
connector, and all four of the Organizational Units on the Address Space tab
contain the maximum length of 32 characters.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
