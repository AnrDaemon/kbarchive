TITLE   :Kids Plus!: Start Menu Loses Hierarchies With Protect It! On
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Plus! for Kids, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MORE INFORMATION
================

Protect It! organizes each family member's Start Menu based on the set
restrictions and stores this information in:

     C:\Windows\Profiles\<user name>\Start Menu

(where C is the drive letter of your hard disk).

The hierarchical information may, on some configurations, get omitted, and all
application shortcuts will appear on the first level of the Start Menu. This can
be a problem when the number of applications exceeds the screen size, so some
applications cannot be accessed via the Start Menu.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Plus! For Kids, Protect It! to set restrictions on family
member profiles, the Start Menu may lose hierarchies when the restricted family
member logs in.

WORKAROUND
==========

To workaround this issue:

1. Go to C:\Windows\Start Menu (where C is the drive letter for you hard disk
   and Windows is your Windows folder).

2. Drag the contents of the Start Menu folder to the
   C:\Windows\Profiles\<username> folder.

3. This will replace the non-hierarchical Start Menu with the default Start
   Menu, with hierarchies. All active Protect It! restrictions will remain.

You can also workaround this issue by creating customization:

1. Go to C:\Windows\Profiles\<username>.

2. Create a Programs folder within the <username> folder, and then drag
   the appropriate program shortcuts into this folder.

3. Create any other desired Start Menu customization to re-enable hierarchies.
   (You must restart Windows for these hierarchical changes to take place.)
