-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Microsoft Exchange Client to retrieve mail via the Remote
Mail dialog on an IBM ThinkPad 701c with an internal modem, after the initial
retrieval of messages, subsequent attempts to retrieve mail via remote mail will
return the following error message:

   An error occurred during the connection. The port was disconnected
   due to a hardware failure.

Once this error message appears, it is necessary to turn off the computer and
restart Windows 95 in order to access the modem.

CAUSE
=====

The ThinkPad's internal modem fails to reset after an initial Exchange Server
connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

 - Use an external or PCMCIA (supported) modem with the ThinkPad.

   -OR-

 - Modify the registry setting for the modem Hangup command, as shown below:

1. Start Registry Editor.

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Modem\0000

3. Highlight the 0000 and verify the Model in the right pane is IBM ThinkPad 701
   Internal Modem. If the 0000 key is this modem, continue down the tree to the
   Hangup key.

4. In the right pane, edit the 1 value and add AT&F to the end of the
   string. Once complete, the string should read:

      ATH<cr>AT&F

5. Exit Registry Editor.

6. Restart the computer and attempt to retreive headers multiple times.

   The addition of AT&F sends the command to reset the modem to the factory
   defaults upon the hangup of the modem.
