The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

A system running Windows NT 4.0 may crash with the following stop message:

   STOP 0x0000001E (0xC0000005, 0x801113B7, 0x00000000, 0x00000040)
   KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED

This will occur during a dismount of an NTFS volume.

NOTE: The second parameter (0x801113B7) may vary.

CAUSE

manager after NTFS has de-referenced it.
