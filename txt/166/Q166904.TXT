TITLE   :Winsock Application Does Not Generate WSAEMSGSIZE Error Code
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAPI kbSDKPlatform kbWinsock kbGrpDSNetkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Winsock application using a sentto function with a buffer size of 2,048 bytes
to another Winsock application using a recvfrom function with a 1,024 byte
buffer size causes data on the client to be truncated.


CAUSE
=====

The client does not get a WSAEMSGSIZE error generated which would prevent a
buffer overrun truncating data.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
