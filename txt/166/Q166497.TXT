PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbdta kbdtacode word8 word97

======================================================================

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to apply borders to selected characters using Microsoft Visual
Basic for Applications, the following error occurs:

   Run-time error '5941': The requested member of the collection does not exist.

CAUSE
=====

By design, character borders will only take 1 or the wdBorderTop constant as
arguments because the character borders count equals 1.

For example, the following Visual Basic for Applications commands will cause the
error to occur if you attempt to designate a right border for a selected
character:

      Selection.Font.Borders(wdBorderRight).LineStyle _
      =WdLineStyleThickThinSmallGap
