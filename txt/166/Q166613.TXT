The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to log on to a Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox from a
Microsoft Exchange for Macintosh client, you may receive the following error
message:

   The logon credentials supplied were incorrect. Make sure
   your username and domain are correct, then type your
   password again.

CAUSE
=====

This error may occur if the Windows NT user account specified contains extended
characters that are not mapped correctly from the Macintosh character set to the
Windows ANSI character set.

WORKAROUND
==========

When creating Windows NT user accounts, avoid using extended characters (for
example, A-umlaut or E-umlaut) in the user name.

NOTE: An umlaut appears as two dots placed above a vowel.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange for the
Macintosh, versions 4.0 and 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest
Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
