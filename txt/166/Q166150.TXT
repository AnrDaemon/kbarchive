KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, McAfee VirusScan for Windows NT cannot be installed using Microsoft
scripted/unattended methods or through the use of Sysdiff.exe.

However, McAfee VirusScan does provide the ability for scripted/unattended
installation by using the InstallShield installation program to install the
product. Through the use of InstallShield and unattend installation features in
Windows NT, proper unattended installation of McAfee VirusScan is possible in a
complete automation package.

The Whatsnew.txt file provided with McAfee VirusScan outlines the proper way to
automate the installation of the product. Refer to the INSTALLATION section of
Whatsnew.txt for instructions on building the scripted/unattend installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With McAfee VirusScan automated and tested, the following options are used with
Windows NT to install the software. Through the use of the RUNONCE and
AUTOADMINLOGON features of Windows NT, the virus software actually is installed
after Windows NT is completely installed.

Once the GUI-mode portion of Setup has completed, the system will reboot and
automatically log on. Once the system is logged on, the McAfee Setup program
will launch and install the product. Once the product is installed, the system
will reboot and the installation is complete.
