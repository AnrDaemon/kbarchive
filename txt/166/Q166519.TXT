TITLE   :XCON: IMS Encapsulates the X.400 O/R Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message from a Defense Messaging System (DMS) client to an SMTP
address, the message may not be successfully processed. The message gets stuck
in the outbound Internet Mail Service (IMS) queue for the message transfer agent
(MTA) on the server.

An error message resembling the following may be generated by the IMS in the
Application Event Log:

   MSExchangeIMS
   Event ID: 4122
   An error occurred while retrieving the originating address of a message
   to be delivered.

   Since the originating address is needed for mail delivery, the mail
   cannot be delivered. The message that was being processed has been moved
   to the "BAD" folder. Use the appropriate utilities found in the SUPPORT
   directory of your Exchange CD to view and manipulate these messages.

When you attempt to view the message within the MTA queue for the IMS, the MTA
service may stop with an error message resembling the following in the
Application Event Log:

   MSExchangeMTA
   Event ID: 2051
   A fatal internal MTA error occurred. Contact Microsoft Product Support
   Services. An illegal GET from element BCC62C01 occurred at offset 12359.
   [BASE SUBMIT 16 67] (16)

CAUSE
=====

If the X.400 O/R address of the originator contains an X.500 distinguished name
(DN) in the domain-defined attribute (DDA) field, the IMS encapsulates the X.400
O/R address instead of using the SMTP proxy, resulting in the stated behavior.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
