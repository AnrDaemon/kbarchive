The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You have a large number of Microsoft Exchange Server users who also have Notes
accounts. You perform directory synchronization (dirsync) and you want the users
to show up in Exchange Server with only one entry in the Global Address List and
you want to have all mail forwarded to the Exchange Account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The only way to perform this task is manually.

1. From Notes you need to modify each user's Person Page. Change the Available
   For Dirsync field to NO and fill in the forward field with the Notes proxy
   address of the Exchange account. This Notes proxy address can be obtained
   from the e-mail message's Addresses tab for the relevant mailbox in the
   Exchange Server Administrator program. When the message arrives in Exchange
   Server, the From field will be, for example:

      John Doe@Notes.

2. To prevent replies to these messages from leaving the Exchange system and
   being returned to Notes, you must create a secondary Notes proxy in Exchange
   Server that matches this address: John Doe @Notes. When Exchange Server
   receives the reply, it will resolve the destination locally.
