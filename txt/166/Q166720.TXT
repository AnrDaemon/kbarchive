TITLE   :FIX: ATL Object Wizard Dialog Box Comes Up Empty
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbwizard kbATL kbVC500bug kbVC600fixkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you access the Active Template Library (ATL) Object Wizard dialog box from
the menu option Insert/New ATL Object, the dialog box comes up empty with no
wizards available.

CAUSE
=====

When Visual C++ is installed, all ATL Object Wizards are registered in the
registry under "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\ATLWizard." Settings under
HKEY_CURRENT_USER are not visible if you login under a different user. If you
install Visual C++ under one user and login as another, you will not see any
available Wizards in the ATL Object Wizard dialog box.

RESOLUTION
==========

Other user logins that need to use Visual C++ on the same computer need to have
the same registry settings under
"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\ATLWizard". Here are the steps to do
this:

1. Login under the account that installed Visual C++.

2. Run REGEDIT.

3. Select "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\ATLWizard."

4. Export this entry to a file by picking Registry/Export Registry File from the
   menu.

5. Login as the other user who will use Visual C++.

6. Double-click the .REG file to merge it with the registry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0
for Windows.
