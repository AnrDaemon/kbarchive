-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following problem occurs when using SNA Server 3.0 on Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 3 (SP3). When stopping the SNA Server service, the service stops responding
(hangs) in a Stopping status within SNA Server Manager.

CAUSE
=====

The Dbgtrace.dll file, which is loaded by SNA Server 3.0 to support asynchronous
tracing (even when tracing is not enabled), wasn't properly terminating during
process detach processing, causing the SNA Server service to hang during
shutdown.

This problem was observed after upgrading to Windows NT 4.0 SP3, but was not
observed on earlier service packs.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
