TITLE   :XADM: 5.0 Proxy Address Generator and Scandinavian Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange Server, when you add a new mailbox and the name includes
extended characters such as the letters a-umlaut or o-umlaut, the characters are
converted to ae and oe (respectively) in the X.400 and SMTP proxy addresses.
This will also be the case with the generation of the common name. To be
readable and logical to Scandinavian users, those letters should be converted to
the standard letters a and o.

NOTE: An umlaut is a character that has two dots above it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the fix is applied, in generating proxy addresses, the mapping of the
Nordic to non-Nordic characters will be based on the Microsoft Exchange Server
locale, not the locale where the Administrator program is running. However, when
generating the common name, the mapping will be based on the locale where the
Administrator program is running.

To prevent unwanted character mapping, for example when the language is German,
the following languages (locales) will trigger Nordic behavior:

   Danish
   Faeroese
   Finnish
   Icelandic
   Norwegian
   Swedish
