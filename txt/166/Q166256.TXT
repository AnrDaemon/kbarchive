TITLE   :XFOR: Directory You Have Selected Is Not a cc:Mail Post Office
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtshoot kbusage exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Migration Wizard for cc:Mail, nothing happens if you select the
root of the cc:Mail post office, using the Browse option. If you manually type
the path to the root in the selector box, the following error message is
displayed:

   The directory you have selected is not a cc:Mail post office.

CAUSE
=====

The post office selected is a DB8 cc:Mail post office. The Exchange 5.0
Migration Wizard does not migrate cc:Mail DB8 (version 2.x) post offices, only
DB6 (version 6.x). Presently, there is not a true migration path from a DB8
cc:Mail post office to Microsoft Exchange Server. Customers needing to migrate
from DB8 post offices must upgrade to Exchange Server version 5.5.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - To migrate cc:Mail users from a DB8 post office to Exchange Server, move the
   users to a DB6 post-office, and then perform the migration.
