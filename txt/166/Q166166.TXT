The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Windows NT, you may receive the following error message when you
back up files using NTBACKUP:

   You Do Not Have Permission to Access Portions of Data. Please see the Owner
   or Administrator to Get Permission.

CAUSE
=====

Normally, this indicates that you do not have appropriate permissions for the
folder you are attempting to back up or to which you are restoring files.

This problem can also be caused when the specified directory name used to backup
has been misspelled or does not exist. In addition, the above error can happen
when you use a batch file for the backup operation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, make sure you have the necessary permissions to perform
the backup and that the folder name is correctly entered and exists.
