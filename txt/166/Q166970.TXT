OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Word 97, if you open a Microsoft Excel 97 worksheet, you may receive the
following error:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

   WinWord has caused an invalid page fault in module Excel32.cnv

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs during the conversion of a formula that is used to mask formula
results.

RESOLUTION
==========

Open the worksheet in Microsoft Excel and copy and paste the information from
Microsoft Excel to Word.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example illustrates a formula that may cause the problem:

1. In cell A1 type "test" (without the quotation marks).

2. In cell A2, type the following:

   =IF(B2=0, "", B2/B2)

3. Save the worksheet and open it in Word 97.

NOTE: The sample workbook that ships with Office 97 contains a Microsoft Excel
example worksheet demonstrating how to mask results. This worksheet will
generate an invalid page fault in excel32.cnv because of the formulas in the
worksheet.
