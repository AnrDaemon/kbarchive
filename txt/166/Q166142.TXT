TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Re-Choose <None> in Bug Property Sheet
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Anomaly Tracking System, version 1.0, included with:
    - Microsoft Visual Studio 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The property sheet portion of the Details tab of a record allows you to alter
the settings of many properties. When entering or modifying a record in the
Anomaly Tracking System (ATS), the Details tab of a record contains a property
section with multiple pop-ups. After resetting the initial value of a property
from <None> to another choice, <None> no longer appears as a choice
on the pop-up.

RESOLUTION
==========

To workaround this problem, a <None> option can be added into a property
option group.

Steps to Add a Value into a Property Option Group
-------------------------------------------------

1. Select Property Options Maintenance from the Tools menu in ATS.

2. On the left side of the 'Property Options Maintenance dialog box, scroll to
   the desired property.

3. Click New to activate the Add/Edit Keywords Options dialog box.

4. In the Name box type "<None>" (without the quotes).

Note: When <None> is chosen for that particular option, the characters
"<None>" are saved with the record.

Using Validation Procedures, it is possible to store a .NULL. or any other value
to the field to represent <None>.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Initially, property group options display <None> as the default choice.
However, once you make a choice other than <None>, the <None> choice
is no longer available.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new issue in ATS.

2. On the property sheet of the Detail tab, change one of the property option
   values to a value other than <None>.

3. Drop-down the same pop-up and observe the available choices.

Note: <None> is not available as a choice. There is not a way to undo the
value selected for the property.
