TITLE   :XFOR: Unable to Delete Read Receipts from Mail Sent to PROFS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to delete or move Read Receipts to the Deleted Items, Outbox,
or Sent Items folders using a Microsoft Exchange Client connected to Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0, the following error message may appear:

   The item could not be deleted. Client operation failed.

The Read Receipts that cause this problem were returned from messages sent to
PROFS users, using the LINKAGE PROFS connector.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two workarounds for this problem:

1. If the Read Receipts are first moved to a personal folder (PST) file, they
   can be deleted.

2. If you log in Off-line and delete the Read Receipts, and then synchronize the
   Off-line personal folder (OST), they will be deleted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange Server configurations that are affected by this problem
include:

 - If you upgrade Microsoft Exchange Server from version 4.0 to 5.0, any Read
   Receipts generated before the upgrade that still exist after the upgrade will
   produce this problem.

 - If the PROFS connector is installed on a Microsoft Exchange Server version
   4.0, Read Receipts generated from messages sent over the PROFS connector
   originating from a user on a Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 will
   produce this problem.

Microsoft Exchange Server configurations that are not affected by this problem
include:

 - If the LINKAGE connector is installed on Microsoft Exchange Server version
   4.0, Read Receipts generated from messages sent from a Microsoft Exchange
   Server version 4.0 user across the LINKAGE connector to a PROFs user can be
   deleted.

 - If the LINKAGE connector is installed on Microsoft Exchange Server version
   5.0, Read Receipts generated from messages sent from a Microsoft Exchange
   Server version 5.0 user across the LINKAGE connector to a PROFs user can be
   deleted.
