TITLE   :Shared Directories Not Accessible with Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a network share with Windows NT 4.0, you may receive the
following error message:

   \\SERVER\SHARE\DIR is not accessible.

   Access is denied.

However, when you log on at other clients (Windows 95, or Windows NT version
3.5x) you do not receive this error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that you have Execute (X) permission on all directories.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT 4.0 redirector requires you to have the Execute (X) permission in
the parent directory. To change to the subdirectory. You can still connect to
the fully qualified file name. For example, NOTEPAD \\SERVER\SHARE\DIR\file.txt
will open without problems.

This problem only occurs when you have Read (R) access through Special Directory
Access. If you are able to select Read from the Type of Access drop down box,
then you already have Read and Execute (RX) permission.
