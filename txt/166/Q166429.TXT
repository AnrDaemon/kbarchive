SUMMARY
=======

To run Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese applications in Pan Chinese
Windows NT Workstation 4.0, you need to switch between different locales.
Otherwise, the applications will not show the proper text or User Interface on
screen.

For BIG5 applications, you must switch system locale to Chinese (Taiwan) locale.
For example, Traditional Chinese Office 95 uses the Chinese (Taiwan) locale.

For GB or GBK applications, you must switch system locale to Chinese (PRC)
locale. For example, Simplified Chinese Office 95 uses the Chinese (PRC)
locale.

Unicode or English applications can run on any Chinese (PRC) or (Taiwan) or (Hong
Kong) locale. For example, Notepad in Pan Chinese Windows NT is able to use any
of these locales.
