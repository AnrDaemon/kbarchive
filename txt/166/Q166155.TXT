PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you print a message that contains an embedded message, attachments in the
embedded message are not printed. The text of the parent message is printed with
the text from the embedded message, but the attachments in the embedded messages
appear as icons. This behavior occurs even if you select the Print Attachments
check box in the Microsoft Exchange Client printing options.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Open the embedded message and print the attachment from the opened message.
