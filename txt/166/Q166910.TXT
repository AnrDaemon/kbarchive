TITLE   :"A Slow Network Connection..." When Logging On at DC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you start a Windows NT 4.0 domain controller and log on at the console,
the following message appears:

   A slow network connection has been detected

The user is then asked whether or not to load a roaming profile. However, if the
user logs off and logs on again after the system has been started, the message
will not be displayed.

CAUSE
=====

Depending on the speed of the computer and the number of services started when
the system starts, it is possible to attempt to log on at the system console
before the networking services have fully started. In this case, a user logging
on at the console may get this message. After networking services have fully
started, the user can log off and log on again without getting the message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, wait until startup drive activity stops before logging
on.
