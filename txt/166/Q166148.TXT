-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The RASEO_TerminalAfterDial and the RASEO_TerminalBeforeDial flags are not set
if specified in the RasSetEntryProperties Win32 function call.

CAUSE
=====

A Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 regression causes these parameters to be
ignored.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the Pop Up A Terminal Window option manually in the phone book after
programmatically creating or modifying the phonebook entry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The RasSetEntryProperties call is used to programmatically create or modify
Remote Access phone book entries. One of the options that can be specified is
whether to open a terminal window before and/or after dialing using the
RASEO_TerminalAfterDial and RASEO_TerminalBeforeDial option flags for dwfOptions
in the rasentry structure that is passed as a parameter by
RasSetEntryProperties.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0 Service
Pack 2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
