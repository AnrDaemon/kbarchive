TITLE   :XFOR: Subject Field for SMTP Outbound Mails not ECU-KR Encoded
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Korean Microsoft Exchange Client that is connected to US Exchange Server
version 5.0 with the Build 1458.15 sends an SMTP mail message with Korean
characters in the subject field, the Korean characters are not readable although
KSC-5601 is set on the Character Set Translation for both MIME and non-MIME in
the Internet Mail tab of the Internet Mail Service Properties.

CAUSE
=====

The "euc-kr" label should be used to encode SMTP mails with Korean characters in
the subject field. If you turn on the Message Archival on the Diagnostics
Logging tab, the outbound SMTP messages with Korean characters in the subject
saved in the IMCDATA\OUT\ARCHIVE directory should have "euc- kr" label in the
subject field. One correctly encoded header is as follows:

   Message-ID: <6180A23D98B7D011BD4800A0C90D616D051C@server.company1.com>
   From:  <user1@company1.com>
   To: "'user2@company2.com'" <user2@company2.com>
   Subject: =?euc-kr?B?Rlc6IL7GufbB9g==?=
   Date: Thu, 22 May 1997 15:55:46 -0700

   MIME-Version: 1.0
   X-Mailer: Internet Mail Service (5.0.1457.3)
   Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-2022-kr"
