SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a CRichEditView or CRichEditCtrl on a CMDIChildWnd and you
right-click the richedit control, focus is set to the richedit control but the
frame is not activated.

CAUSE
=====

The richedit control is not sending a WM_MOUSEACTIVATE message to its parent.

RESOLUTION
==========

Override OnMouseActivate() in a CRichEditView or CRichEditCtrl and pass this
message on to the parent. The MORE INFORMATION section below has code that
illustrates this.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code
-----------

      /* Compile options needed: default
      */ 

      int CTestView::OnMouseActivate(CWnd* pDesktopWnd,
         UINT nHitTest, UINT message)
      {
         const MSG* pMsg = GetCurrentMessage();

         GetParent()->SendMessage(WM_MOUSEACTIVATE,
            pMsg->wParam, pMsg->lParam);

         return CRichEditView::OnMouseActivate(pDesktopWnd,
            nHitTest, message);
      }
