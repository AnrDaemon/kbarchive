======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for setting up Server-Side T-SQL Debugging incorrectly states
that you can find Sdi_nt4.exe and Readme.txt in the \CliSrv\Tsql\SrvSetup
directory of your Visual Basic Enterprise installation.

The documentation should that the Readme.txt file can be found in the
\Tools\Tsql\Srvsetup directory of your Visual Basic Enterprise CD-ROM.

Sdi_nt4.exe is located in the CliSrv\Tsql\SrvSetup directory of your Visual Basic
Enterprise Edition version 5.0 CD and under the sqdbg_ss\ directory on the
Visual Basic Enterprise Edition version 6.0 CD Two. For Visual Basic 6.0, run
the setup.exe found under the sqdbg_ss\ directory. For Visual Basic 5.0, on
Windows NT 4.0, run the Sdi_nt4.exe setup program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following is the corrected version of the documentation:

Server-Side Setup
-----------------

With SQL Server version 6.5 and Service Pack 1 installed, you can install and
register the SQL Debugger interface and Remote Automation component on the
server. These components are located in the \Tools\Tsql\Srvsetup directory of
your Visual Basic Enterprise CD-ROM. On Windows NT 4.0, run the setup program
Sdi_nt4.exe.

NOTE: For set up on Windows NT Server 3.51, you must manually copy and register
the necessary files. Complete instructions for this process are included in the
Readme.txt file in the \Tools\Tsql\Srvsetup directory of your Visual Basic
Enterprise CD-ROM.
