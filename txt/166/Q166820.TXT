KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit Supplement 1 includes four desktop
components that are not included in the original Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource
Kit.

The new components are:

      CMD Prompt Here (Cmdhere.inf)
      Security        (Rshxmenu.inf)
      Run             (Runext.inf)
      TweakUI         (Tweakui.inf)

The new components are located in the PowerToy directory under the resource kit
directory. If you used the default to install the resource kit, the directory is
C:\Ntreskit\Powertoy

To manually install the new components, go to Windows NT Explorer and highlight
the .inf file. Right-click and then click Install from the menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To automate the installation of the Power Toys during deployment or unattended
installation of Windows NT 4.0, you need an Unattend.txt file that is configured
to install Windows NT 4.0. Follow these steps:

1. Add the option OEMPreInstall = Yes to the [UNATTENDED] section in the answer
   file.

2. Create an I386 directory on a server and copy the files from the I386
   directory of the Windows NT 4.0 compact disc to the I386 directory on the
   server.

3. Create a directory called $OEM$ under the I386 directory on the server.

4. Copy the contents of the PowerToy directory to the $OEM$.

         Cmdhere.inf
         Rshxmenu.inf
         Rshxmenu.X86
         Runext.inf
         Runext.X86
         Tweakui.CNT
         Tweakui.CPL
         Tweakui.HLP
         Tweakui.inf

5. Use a text editor to create or modify the Cmdlines.txt file, and save it to
   the $OEM$.

To save time, you can copy the following 5 lines of information to create the
required Cmdlines.txt.

      [Commands]
      "rundll32 setupapi,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 128 .\CMDHERE.INF"
      "rundll32 setupapi,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 128 .\RSHXMENU.INF"
      "rundll32 setupapi,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 128 .\RUNEXT.INF"
      "rundll32 setupapi,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 128 .\TWEAKUI.INF"

If you have an existing Cmdlines.txt file, do not copy the [Commands] line, as an
existing Cmdlines.txt file has this line.

1. A modification of the Tweakui.inf file in the $OEM$ directory is required to
   prevent the Windows NT 4.0 installation from stopping. When the TweakUI
   utility runs, a help file is displayed during installation. To disable the
   help file, comment the following line in Tweakui.inf with a semicolon:

         HKLM,%SMWCV%\RunOnce\Setup,%ITWEAK%,,"WINHLP32.EXE -i Main
         %18%\TWEAKUI.HLP"

Your Tweakui.inf should look like this after the semicolon is added:

      HKLM,%SMWCV%\Run,%TWEAKUI%,,"RUNDLL32.EXE TWEAKUI.CPL,TweakMeUp"
      HKLM,%SMWCV%\RunOnce\Setup,%UPTWEAK%,,"RUNDLL32.EXE
         TWEAKUI.CPL,TweakMeUp 0";
      HKLM,%SMWCV%\RunOnce\Setup,%ITWEAK%,,"WINHLP32.EXE -i Main
         %18%\TWEAKUI.HLP"

NOTE: The previous text should take up 3 lines. It has been wrapped for
readability.

Consult the Windows NT 4.0 Device Driver Kit (DDK) and the Windows NT 4.0
Software Development Kit (SDK) for detailed information on the new INF format
and options.

For additional information on the Windows NT 4.0 Power Toys, consult the online
documentation for Windows NT 4.0 Server Supplement 1.

For additional information on Windows NT 4.0 deployment or unattended
installation, consult the Microsoft Knowledge Base at
http://www.microsoft.com/kb and download the Windows NT 4.0 Deployment Guide
from http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/.

NOTE: The Deployment Guide is valid for both Windows NT Workstation and Windows
NT Server.
