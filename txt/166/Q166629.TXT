TITLE   :XADM: Store Defrag Fails with Access Violation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are defragmenting the Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store and
you specify "EDBUTIL /d /ispriv," Microsoft Exchange Server stops responding. An
access violation error message similar to the following appears:

   EDBUTIL.EXE - Application Error

   The instruction at "0x<some-memory-address>" referenced memory at
   "0x00000000". The memory could not be written. Click OK to terminate
   or CANCEL to debug the application."

In addition, a Drwtsn32.log and User.dmp file are created if Dr. Watson is
configured properly as the default system debugger.

CAUSE
=====

While defragmenting the attachments table, even if data to be copied is
zero-length, the utility assumes that it has traversed down the tree one level,
and so it inappropriately "backs up" one level to continue defragmenting. This
can result in the access violation.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
