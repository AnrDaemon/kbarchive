KEYWORDS:kbtable

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you vertically merge two or more table cells, the Height Of Row property
changes to an At Least setting. This means that if you set the Height Of Row
property to Auto or Exactly and then vertically merge the cells, you lose the
Auto or Exactly settings.

CAUSE
=====

The Height Of Row property is reset to the At Least setting after a vertical
merge in order to accommodate all of the text from the merged cells.

RESOLUTION
==========

After you merge the table cells, reset the row height:

1. With the insertion point in the merged cell, click Cell Height and Width on
   the Table menu.

2. Click the Row tab.

3. In the Height Of Row drop-down list, select the setting you want.

4. Optional: In the At box, select the value and type a new measurement, or
   click the arrows to select a new value.

5. Click OK.
