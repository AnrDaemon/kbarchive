The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

SQL Server Named Pipes network support is required for Systems Management Server
Setup to communicate with the SQL Server that stores the Systems Management
Server database. Systems Management Server utilities and services use Named
Pipes by default, and may have problems connecting to the Systems Management
Server database if SQL Server is configured incorrectly. For example, if Named
Pipes network support is not loaded, the Systems Management Server Administrator
program may fail to start up, and produce the error message, "Unable to Connect
to SQL Server."

You can change the SQL Server network support option by running SQL Server Setup,
selecting Change Network Support, and then selecting Named Pipes as an installed
network.

If you use multiple SQL Server networks, it is recommended that you set Named
Pipes as the default network. You can configure this on the Net Library Settings
tab of the SQL Server Client Configuration Utility.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
