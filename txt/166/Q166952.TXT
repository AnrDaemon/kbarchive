TITLE   :WD97: Unable to Send to Fax Recipient from Word
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbusage word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to send a document from Word 97 to a Microsoft Fax recipient, the
document may remain in the Microsoft Exchange Outbox and may not be faxed out.

This problem occurs when you are using Microsoft Word 97, Microsoft Exchange, and
Microsoft Fax.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.

Method 1:

Send another document from Word. If another document is sent, the previous
document will be flushed from the Exchange Outbox and will be faxed.

Method 2:

Save the document and then Fax the document using the Microsoft Fax application
rather than using the Send feature in Word.

Method 3:

Print the document using Microsoft Fax as the printer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem occurs when you use the Send To feature in Word. To use this
feature, you would follow these steps:

1. Create a document in Word.

2. On the File menu, point to Send To, and click Mail Recipient or Fax
   Recipient.

Word will then attach the document to an Exchange e-mail message addressed to the
fax recipient. The e-mail message goes to the Exchange outbox, where the
Microsoft Fax application will pick it up and transmit it.

The e-mail message gets "stuck" in the outbox and doesn't get transmitted until
another e-mail messages is sent.
