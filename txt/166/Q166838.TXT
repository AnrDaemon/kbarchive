TITLE   :System Policies No Longer Applied Using 3rd-Party Client Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbenv kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

System Policies on a Windows NT system may not take affect. The policies may not
work when first implemented, or subsequent changes to the central policy file
may not alter existing policy settings on the client.

CAUSE
=====

There may be many causes to Policies not being read by the client. A few
standard things to check include verifying the location of the policy file
Ntconfig.pol on the Netlogon share, verifying this policy file being replicated
to all domain controllers within the domain, and verifying the Update mode of
the client is set properly.

Another cause may be a third-party service or client redirector. To verify this
is the cause, remove the third-party client software and try the policies
again.
