The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run an Active Messaging Application from a Windows NT
Service (for example, AT Scheduler) the following error message may appear.

   MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND

The error message is returned from the Active Messaging Session Object when a
profile name is passed. The application runs successfully when it is not being
run in a Windows NT service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION

configuration to initialize a MAPI session. For more information, please refer
