TITLE   :XFOR: AS/400 DXA on RISC Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The AS/400 directory synchronization agent that ships with Microsoft Exchange
Server5.0 can only run on a CISC AS/400 because four of the objects do not
convert automatically from 48-bit to 64-bit.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem and run the AS/400 DXA on a RISC computer:

1. The tape provided contains four objects to replace the four objects currently
   located in the DXA400 library.

   These objects are:

   ADDDAT, ADDTIM, TAADATAC, TAATIMAC

   Use the command DLTOBJ to delete the four objects mentioned above from the
   DXA400 library, and use the command RSTOBJ to retrieve the four objects from
   the tape to the DXA400 library.

2. The AS/400 DXA uses the command DSPDIR, which has been replaced by DSPDIRE.
   In order for the AS/400 DXA to access the AS/400 directory, copy the DSPDIR
   object from QSYS/DSPDIRE to DXA400/DSPDIR.

3. The physical file QRYDST with member QRYDST has maximum record length of 246
   when it should be 251. The following command re-creates the file with the
   proper record length:

   " CRTPF FILE(DXA400/QRYDST) RCDLEN(251)" (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by product design.
