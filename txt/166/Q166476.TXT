TITLE   :Can't Index Embedded Objects in PowerPoint Slideshow
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Microsoft Index Server to search for filtered files, embedded
objects in a PowerPoint slideshow may not indexed properly and therefore a hit
will not be made from a search query on strings in the embedded object. Text in
the slide that was not embedded is filtered and indexed properly.

CAUSE
=====

The Index Server filter for PowerPoint slideshows does not properly handle
embedded objects.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Index Server 2.0 or Windows 2000 Indexing
Service.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is currently no method to force the embedded object to be filtered. To
work around this problem:

 - Save the embedded object as a separate file or embedded in a different
   application, such as Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel, that does not exhibit
   this behavior.

If you want stop the event ID associated with this error, add the following
registry setting:

   REGEDIT4

   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\ContentIndex]

   "EventLogFlags"=dword:00000000

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Microsoft Index Server version
1.1. This problem is corrected in Index Server 2.0 and Windows 2000 Indexing
Service.
