TITLE   :WD97: Back Button Not Available After Viewing HTML Source
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop word97 kbwdinternet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you follow a hyperlink to an HTML document, the Back button on the Web
toolbar will be available, allowing you to navigate to the previous document.
If, however, you view the HTML source and then exit the HTML source, the Back
button will become unavailable (dimmed).

CAUSE
=====

The View HTML feature works by closing and reopening the document. The traversal
list (the forward/back information) is lost in this process.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view the HTML source, open an HTML document, and on the View menu, click View
HTML source.

To exit the HTML source, click the Exit HTML Source toolbar button. Or, on the
View menu, click Exit HTML source.
