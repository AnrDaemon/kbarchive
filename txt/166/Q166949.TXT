TITLE   :WD97: Unable to Fax When You Start Word the First Time
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you have Outlook 97 and Word 97 installed on your computer and you try to fax
to an Outlook Contact without starting Word 97 at least once, Word appears to
stop responding (hang) during the faxing process.

CAUSE
=====

The first time you start Word (or any Office 97 program), you are prompted for
the user name and initials. If Word is started for the first time from a fax
request, the dialog box requesting user information is displayed. However, Word
does not have the focus, so Word appears to hang (in actuality, Word is waiting
for the user information).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, switch to Word 97, type the user information, and click
OK in the dialog box. The fax will continue to be sent.

Future faxing will not have this problem, because Word only needs the user
information to be entered the first time it is started.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
