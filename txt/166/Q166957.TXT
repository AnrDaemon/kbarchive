-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After a mail merge main document has been saved in Rich Text Format (RTF) or
Word 6.0/95 format, you may experience one or both of the following problems.

Case 1: Error Message Opening the File
--------------------------------------

When opening the file, you may receive the following message:

   <file name>.rtf is a mail merge main document. Word cannot find its
   data source.

This message may be followed by:

   <file name>.rtf is a mail merge main document. Word cannot find its
   header source.

NOTE: These error messages seem to occur most often when opening a mailing label
main merge document in Microsoft Word 6.x for the Macintosh or Microsoft Word
for Windows 95, version 7.x. But they may occur at other times.

Case 2: Merge Type Changed
--------------------------

Once the file is opened, the merge type of the main document is changed to "Form
Letters."

NOTE: This problem occurs regardless of which merge type the mail merge main
document is set to initially.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the appropriate method for your situation.

Method 1: If You Receive the Error Message When You Open the File
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To find the data source, follow these steps:

1. Click Find Data Source.

2. Select the data file associated with the mail merge main document.

3. Click Open.

4. If the following message appears:

   <file name>.rtf is a mail merge main document. Word cannot find its
   header source.

   click Options.

5. In the next dialog box, click Remove Data/Header Source.

Method 2: If the Merge Type Is Changed
--------------------------------------

Use the appropriate method for your situation.

Form Letters or Catalogs:

For form letters or catalog merge types, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge.

2. In the Mail Merge Helper, click Create, and then click either Form Letters or
   Catalog.

   You receive the following message:

   You can change <file name>.rtf from form letters to <merge type>
   or you can create a new main document.

3. Click "Change Document Type."

   The document "Merge Type" is now shown correctly in the Mail Merge Helper.

Envelopes or Mailing Labels:

For Envelopes or Mailing Labels merge types, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge.

2. In the Mail Merge Helper, click Create, and then click either Envelopes or
   Mailing Labels.

   You receive the following message:

   You can change <file name>.rtf from form letters to mailing labels or
   you can create a new main document.

3. Click "Change Document Type."

   This may activate the Setup button (in step 1 Main Document) which disables
   the Merge button (in step 3 "Merge the Data with the document"). To perform a
   mail merge if the Merge Button is disabled, use either of the following
   methods.

   Use the Mail Merge Toolbar
   --------------------------

   a. Click Close to close the Mail Merge Helper.

   b. Click the "Merge to New Document" icon on the Mail Merge Toolbar.

   Use the Mail Merge Helper
   -------------------------

   a. Click Setup.

   b. Select the Product Number and click OK.

   c. Insert your merge fields and click OK.

      You receive the following message:

   This mail merge main document is not empty. Continuing will replace all text
   in this document with new text.

   d. Click OK.

   NOTE: You may want to save your mail merge main document in Word format to
   prevent this problem from reoccurring.
