TITLE   :XWEB: Spaces in Alias Name Cause "Failed to get Inbox"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use a browser to access a Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox
(that is, using the Microsoft Exchange Server Web Connector), one of the
following error messages is displayed:

   Microsoft Internet Explorer
   Failed to get inbox.

   -or-

   Netscape Navigator
   Failed to get inbox.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox alias name has a comma or spaces in it.

RESOLUTION
==========

Your server administrator can use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator
program to remove any spaces from any mailbox name that contains spaces.

NOTE: An underscore can be used in the alias name without problem.

NOTE: This same error can also be an example of an ambiguous name resolution
problem. This occurs when the alias names are similar to other alias names due
to the last name being the same. If you perform a check name on an Exchange or
Outlook Client and it pulls up a list, this is what is happening.
