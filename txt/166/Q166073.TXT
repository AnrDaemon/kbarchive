TITLE   :Adding Connections/Link Services Causes Event 5167 and 5166
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following events will be logged when trying to add a link service or
connection in SNA Server Manager when the SNA Server service is Active:

   Event ID: 5167
   Source: SNA Manage Agent
   Description:
   An internal error has occurred in mngsna module - Dynamic update for
   3270 LU failed.

   Event ID: 5166
   Source: SNA Manage Agent
   Description:
   An internal error has occurred in the snaadmin module - Received an
   error in dynamic update response - update failed.

CAUSE
=====

Because the SNA Server Service does not allow connections and link services to
be added while it is running, SNA Manager should not try to send any dynamic
updates for resources on those connections.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix is available to correct this problem. To resolve this problem, obtain the
hotfix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
