PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbOSWin95 kbSDKWin16kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The documentation for and expected behavior of the Arc() API is to draw an
entire ellipse if the start and end points are the same. However, when you do
this in Windows 95 with the Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4 printer driver, the
result is no output at all.

RESOLUTION
==========

To workaround this, you can:

Specify "Use Raster Graphics" in the "Graphics" page of the printer's properties
dialog box.

-or-

Have the application detect the ellipse case and call Ellipse() instead of Arc().

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Additional query words: Arc Ellipse circle
