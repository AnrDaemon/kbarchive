SYMPTOMS
========

While using Windows Explorer to copy a disk, the following error is returned:

   COPY DISK - error: unable to copy disk on this drive.

CAUSE
=====

While the drive is selected in the left pane in Windows Explorer, there is an
open handle to the drive to display its contents in the right pane. This causes
a conflict between the two processes, as each tries to access the same
resource.


RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following workarounds:

 - Use My Computer instead of Windows Explorer to copy the disk.

-or-

 - While in Windows Explorer, double click the My Computer icon in the left pane
   and then use the floppy (A:) drive in the right pane to copy the disk.

Either of these two procedures allows you to copy a disk, if the drive is not in
use by any other process or application.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
