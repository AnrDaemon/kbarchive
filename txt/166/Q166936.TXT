TITLE   :PRB: Letters A through J and M Invalid Object Variable Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b; WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbHWMAC kbvfp kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error occurs when trying to access the properties of an object
that is named by a single character from A through J, or M:

   Variable '<variablename>' not found.

CAUSE
=====

The letters A through J are reserved by Visual FoxPro to reference workspace
names. The letter M is reserved for backward compatibility with the SCATTER and
GATHER commands.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not name object variables by the single characters from A through J or M.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form.

2. Place a command button on the form.

3. In the Click event of the command button, place the following code:

         C=THISFORM
         WAIT WINDOW C.NAME

   When this code is run, it produces this error:

   Variable 'NAME' Not Found

If you need to use one of these letters as an object variable, use the following
method to return the value of a property. This does not allow the setting of
properties, nor does it expose any methods of the object.

         C="THISFORM"
         WAIT WINDOW EVALUATE(C+".NAME")
