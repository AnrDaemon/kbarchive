TITLE   :WV: Cannot Follow Hyperlink to Its Source from Word Viewer
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbusage kbviewer word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you choose to have Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000 as the default program for
opening documents, clicking a hyperlink to a document opens the document in Word
Viewer.

Because Word Viewer does not have a Web toolbar, there is no way to navigate
"back" to the source of the link. That is, there is no "back" button in Word
Viewer.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000 does not support toolbars.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are navigating from one document to another document by clicking
hyperlinks inside Word Viewer, you can work around this problem by using the
"most recently used file" list on the File menu to switch from the current
document to the previous document. However, the "most recently used file" list
only shows the four most recently opened documents.
