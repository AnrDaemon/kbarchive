======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Plus! for Kids, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Plus! For Kids Protect It! allows you to place restrictions on family
members using your computer. It will not, however, allow you to hide, delete, or
otherwise restrict the main system icons, such as the Recycle Bin or My
Computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may want to limit family members' access to the Recycle Bin. For example, so
family members using your computer cannot perform an unauthorized delete. This
is not a feature of Protect It!

There is a Windows 95 Power Toy named TweakUI that will allow you to restrict
access to the Recycle Bin. Microsoft does not support the Power Toys, so you
should use TweakUI at your own risk. TweakUI is available for download at
http://www.microsoft.com.

NOTE: See TweakUI's online Help for consequences of performing certain actions
(i.e., If you choose to hide the Network Neighborhood icon from the desktop, you
will prevent connections to network shares via Universal Naming Conventions or
UNCs).
