TITLE   :XFOR: Migration Wizard Hangs with Invalid Entry in SEC File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Migration Wizard to import users from file and there is a
problem with the secondary file, the application may stop responding. The file
will be processed up until the point where the error occurred and errors will be
logged in the Windows NT Event Viewer application log. This will only happen
when running the Migration Wizard on Windows NT Server 3.51. The problem does
not occur with Windows NT Server 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is caused by a NULL value that is generated when an improperly
constructed or corrupted entry in the .SEC migration file is read by the
Migration Wizard. This NULL value is not properly handled and the application
shuts down.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
