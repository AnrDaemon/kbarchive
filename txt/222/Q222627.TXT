SUMMARY
=======

Auto Dial is a feature associated with MSN 2.5 and 2.6 that, when enabled,
allows you to connect to the Internet automatically whenever you open an
application requiring an Internet connection.

Auto Dial is not enabled in your MSN default settings. Enabling Auto Dial can be
useful if you would like to access the Internet on a regular basis without
having to use the MSN Connection Manager every time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To disable AutoDial, double-click the MSN icon. When the Connection Manager
screen appears, click Cancel, and then click the Dial Automatically box to
remove the check.
