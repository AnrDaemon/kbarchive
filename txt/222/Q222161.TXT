======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your Windows NT-based computer, a service may not start.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a program file in the %SystemRoot% folder has the
same name as a Windows NT service that is located in the %SystemRoot%\System32
folder. When this occurs, the program in the %SystemRoot% folder is started
instead of the service with the same name.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, move the file whose name is the same as the service
that should start to another folder.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All users who are authorized to log on locally to a Windows NT-based computer
have write access to the %SystemRoot% folder and can cause this issue to occur
by placing a file in the %SystemRoot folder. To minimize the risk of this issue,
you may want to implement stringent security guidelines on your computers
running Windows NT. For additional information about Windows NT security, please
