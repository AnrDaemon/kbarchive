OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The clock displayed on the taskbar on a Terminal Server-based computer always
reports the time relative to the time zone setting on the Terminal Server-based
computer. This time is displayed in all client sessions, regardless of the time
zone settings on the client computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a user has the appropriate user rights, he or she can change the time zone
setting in the client session. This change affects all Terminal Server sessions,
including the console.

Note that the registry entry for the time zone is stored under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. Thus, the entry is per computer, and not per user.


Additional query words: systray system tray
