SYMPTOMS
========

When you send one or more large messages, the Message Transfer Agent (MTA) may
stop processing messages. It may not be possible to stop the MTA in the Windows
NT Server Control Panel Services tool. The problem appears when messages
containing very large attachments are sent. If the Exchange Server MTA logging
for the Resource category was set to maximum, a large number of the following
event can be found in the Windows NT Server Application Event log:

   Event ID: 2136
   Description: Resource Monitoring Event, severity 10
   (DB Server RTSE(29) Proc 4) 12-09-98 11:22:20am
   Thread pausing due to cache shortage
   Resource in shortage DB buffer

version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
