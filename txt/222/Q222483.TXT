TITLE   :SBS: Services Do Not Work After Installing Service Pack 3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) to a Small Business Server
(SBS) version 4.0-based or 4.0a-based computer, you may experience performance
problems and the following services may no longer function properly:

 - Remote Access service

 - Modem Sharing

 - Fax Server

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 and 4.0

 - Microsoft Proxy Server 1.0 and 2.0

 - The Manage Server Console

Small Business Server-specific RAS files are overwritten by the Service Pack 3
for Windows NT 4.0 installation. Because RAS is directly affected, the services
listed above may no longer function properly depending on how the server is set
up.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur after you manually apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 to
your SBS version 4.0 or 4.0a-based computer. When you do so, some SBS files are
overwritten with incorrect versions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods:

 - If Service Pack 3 has only been applied once and the "Create uninstall
   directory" option was selected during the installation, run Service Pack 3
   Setup again and choose the "Uninstall a previously installed Service Pack" to
   roll back Small Business Server to the SBS-specific version of Service Pack
   3.

 - Restore a backup of your SBS computer made before you applied Windows NT 4.0
   Service Pack 3.

 - Reinstall SBS version 4.0 or 4.0a.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
