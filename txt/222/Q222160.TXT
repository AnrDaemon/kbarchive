TITLE   :Security Configuration Editor Has Several UI-Related Problems
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While working with the Security Configuration Editor MMC snap-in, you might
experience several problems with the user interface and handling:

 - You cannot look at service security in the results of a system analysis
   twice. The Service Security button is not calling the dialog box anymore.

 - When you have modified the security of a service, it is shown as modified
   only the first time after analysis is run. If you look at a different service
   and then look at the modified service again, "Exclude from future
   configurations and analyses" is selected as if you did not change it.

 - After modifying a template, when you exit the Microsoft Management Console,
   you are prompted to save modifications to the current console, and also to
   the modified template. If you answer "Yes" to both questions (thus saving the
   modified template) and then rerun Microsoft Management Console and edit the
   template, the changes are lost. You have to save the template explicitly
   before exiting Microsoft Management Console.

CAUSE
=====

The snap-in is not setting internal status flags consistently.
