TITLE   :XADM: Cannot Modify Database Paths on Clustered Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program to view the
properties of an Exchange Server computer in a clustered environment, and you
click the Database Paths tab, and then modify the location of one of the objects
in the list, the object is not moved successfully. The associated services are
stopped, the folder is moved, and then the services are restarted, but the
registry is not updated correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent this problem from occurring when you modify the database paths for an
Exchange Server computer in a clustered environment, use the Performance
Optimizer program to modify the paths instead of the Administrator program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server version 5.5
Service Pack 3.
