TITLE   :XADM: Advanced Security Enrollment Welcome Message is Wrong
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an Exchange Server 5.5 administrator enrolls a user in Advance Security,
and the user is using Outlook 98, the user will receive the following message:

   Your advanced security temporary key is %TOKEN%. To enroll in advanced
   security and start generating security credentials, from the Tools menu
   choose Options, and then choose Security. Choose Setup Advanced Security.

However, when the user clicks Options and selects the Security tab, there is no
Setup Advanced Security option.

CAUSE
=====

The default Enrollment Message in Exchange Server 5.5 was designed for Outlook
97. In Outlook 98, the Security tab was changed.

RESOLUTION
==========

When a Exchange Server 5.5 service pack is applied, the default Enrollment
Welcome Message is changed to:

   Your advanced security temporary key is %TOKEN%. To enroll in advanced
   security and start generating security credentials, please do the following:

   From the Tools menu in Outlook 98, choose Options, and then choose Security.
   Select Get a Digital ID, and then click Set up Security for me on the
   Exchange Server. Click OK, and enter your temporary key.

   If you are using earlier versions of Outlook, from the Tools menu choose
   Options, and then choose Security. Click Set Up Advanced Security.

WORKAROUND
==========

In Exchange Server 5.5, the Enrollment Welcome Message can be changed. To do
this:

1. Log onto the Exchange Administrator program.

2. Go to the properties of the Certificate Authority (CA) under the
   Configuration object of the Site.

3. Click on the Enrollment tab.

4. Click on the Edit Welcome Message button.

5. Replace the text in the body of the message with:

   Your advanced security temporary key is %TOKEN%. To enroll in advanced
   security and start generating security credentials, please do the following:

   From the Tools menu in Outlook 98, choose Options, and then choose Security.
   Select Get a Digital ID, and then click Set up Security for me on the
   Exchange Server. Click OK, and enter your temporary key.

   If you are using earlier versions of Outlook, from the Tools menu choose
   Options, and then choose Security. Click Set Up Advanced Security.
