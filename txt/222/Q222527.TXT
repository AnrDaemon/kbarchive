2. Place a command button and a label on Form1.

3. Paste the following code into the code module of Form1:

   Option Explicit

   Public Declare Function CreateProcess Lib "coredll.DLL" _
       Alias "CreateProcessW" _
       (ByVal lpApplicationName As String, _
        ByVal lpCommandLine As String, _
        ByVal lpProcessAttributes As Long, _
        ByVal lpThreadAttributes As Long, _
        ByVal bInheritHandles As Long, _
        ByVal dwCreationFlags As Long, _
        ByVal lpEnvironment As Long, _
        ByVal lpCurrentDirectory As String, _
        ByVal lpStartupInfo As Long, _

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       Dim ret
       ret = CreateProcess("windows\repllog.exe", "/remote", _
                           0, 0, False, 0, 0, "", 0, 0)
       If ret = 1 Then
           Label1.Caption = "Success"
       Else
           Label1.Caption = "Failure"
       End If
   End Sub
