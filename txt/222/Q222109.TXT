TITLE   :Using Persistent Verification, Blank Password Not Sent To Host
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0SP1,4.0SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna300sp4fix kbsna400sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the host indicates support for persistent verification in the LU6.2 BIND
command, and an APPC or CPIC application attempts to allocate a conversation
with the password set to spaces (blank), no security vectors are sent in the
FMH-5 attach request. This could cause the host to reject the FMH-5 attach
request with the following sense code:

   080F6051 = Access Security Information Invalid

Note that this sense code is normal if an invalid user ID or password is provided
to the host. However, in this special case (where persistent verification is
being used), the SNA Server APPC DLL (Wappc32.dll) fails to send any security
information to the host (for example, the user ID or password).

RESOLUTION
==========
