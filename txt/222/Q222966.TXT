SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to call a method running inside an ActiveX Scripting
engine, such as Visual Basic Script or Java Script, from an ActiveX Scripting
host.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Follow these steps to call a method running inside an ActiveX Scripting engine
from its ActiveX Scripting host:

Step-by-Step Procedures
-----------------------

1. After creating and initializing the ActiveX Scripting engine, add the method
   by calling IActiveScriptParse::ParseScriptText as follows:

   HRESULT IActiveScriptParse::ParseScriptText( LPCOLESTR pstrCode, 
      LPCOLESTR pstrItemName, IUnknown *punkContext, 
      LPCOLESTR pstrDelimiter, DWORD dwSourceContextCookie,
      ULONG ulStartingLineNumber, DWORD dwFlags, VARIANT *pvarResult,
      EXCEPINFO *pexcepinfo );

2. The ActiveX Scripting engine starts with a call to the
   IActiveScript::SetScriptState method, passing either the SCRIPTSTATE_STARTED
   or SCRIPTSTATE_CONNECTED flag.

3. When you want to call the script method from your ActiveX Scripting host,
   call IActiveScript::GetScriptDispatch to get an IDispatch pointer, which you
   can use to call the method. Pass as the pstrItemName, which is the same value
   you passed in the pstrItemName parameter of ParseScriptText. If you left
   pstrItemName NULL in your call to ParseScriptText, leave it NULL here as
   well. This will retrieve an IDispatch pointer to all the global methods in
   the ActiveX Scripting engine. Pass the address of an IDispatch pointer as the
   second parameter as follows:

   HRESULT IActiveScriptParse::GetScriptDispatch( LPCOLESTR lptrItemName, 
      IDispatch **ppdisp );

4. If the call to GetScriptDispatch succeeds, you can use the IDispatch pointer
   that you passed to call your script method. Call IDispatch::GetIDsOfNames to
   get a DISPID for the method you want to call. Use that DISPID to make a call
   to IDispatch::Invoke.
