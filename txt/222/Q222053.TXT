TITLE   :RAS May Not Answer After Proxy Autodisconnects
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,2.0,4.0,4.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Server versions 4.0, 4.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Proxy Server versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The remote access server may stop answering incoming calls.


CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs on servers running both Microsoft Proxy Server and Remote
Access Service. If the Proxy Server initiates an AutoDial connection to the
Internet using a RAS phone book entry at the request of the Winsock Proxy
Service, and that session is later autodisconnected by the Proxy Server because
of lack of activity, the modem that was used for the Proxy connection may not
answer incoming RAS calls. After Proxy disconnects the session, the Winsock
Proxy Service may not return the port to RAS.

The problem does not occur if the Proxy AutoDial connection was initiated by the
Web Proxy service.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Stop and restart the Remote Access Service.

 - Use Dial-Up Networking on the server to initiate a connection through the
   affected modem. It is not necessary to actually connect to a remote network.
   It is only necessary to have RAS dial out on the affected modem port. After
   RAS initializes the port, you can hang up the connection.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
