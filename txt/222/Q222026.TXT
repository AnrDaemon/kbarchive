SYMPTOMS
========

If you set up and test the Project sample application included on the companion
CD-ROM, and you have Microsoft Exchange Service Pack 2 installed, you may
receive the following error message in Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later,
when you click a link to a project:

   Collaboration Data Objects error '000004f7' [Collaboration Data Objects -
   [MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND(8004010F)]] /project/projectmain.asp, line 178

CAUSE
=====

The semantics for the GetFolder method (Session object) changed from Service
Pack 1 to Service Pack 2 of Exchange Server 5.5. If the GetFolder method is not
called properly, a MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND error may be displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, specify a value for the second parameter of the
GetFolder method. The second parameter can be either the EntryID for the
information store the application is trying to access or NULL, which corresponds
to the default information store.

To correct the Project sample application, follow these steps:

1. Open Project\ProjectMain.asp in Notepad

2. Locate the line:

   set oProjectFolder = oSession.GetFolder(strProjectFolderID)

3. Change the line to:

   set oProjectFolder = oSession.GetFolder(strProjectFolderID, NULL)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The second parameter of the GetFolder method allows you to specify the
information store the application is trying to access.
