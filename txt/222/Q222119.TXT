TITLE   :SNA Server Fails With Event 686 Using Persistent Verification
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0SP3,4.0,4.0SP1,4.0SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna300sp4fix kbsna400sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using persistent verification on LU6.2 sessions, SNA Server may fail
unexpectedly with the following event:

   Event ID: 686
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: SNA Server Internal buffer pool error

When this occurs, all SNA Server processes must be restarted, including SnaBase
and the SNA Server service.

CAUSE
=====

To support persistent verification, the SNA Server service may be required to
remove the password vector from the FMH-5 Attach request received from the SNA
Server APPC DLL (Wappc32.dll). In one case, SNA Server failed to properly
reformat the message, which resulted in internal SNA buffer pool corruption.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0 (post SP2)

4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
