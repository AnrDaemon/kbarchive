TITLE   :XADM: Extended Characters Cause Directory Replication to Break
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) commands by means of
an LDAP client to add mailboxes into Exchange Server, if any attributes of the
object being added use extended characters (for example, in the Distinguished
Name and Relative Distinguished Name), intersite replication will stop working.

This will be logged as follows in the event logs at the time the knowledge
consistency check (KCC) runs:

   Event ID: 1171
   Description: Exception e0010002 has occurred with parameters 9 and 2 (Internal
   ID 3190039). Contact Microsoft Technical Support for assistance.

The other noted effect is that this added object cannot be deleted from the
directory using the Exchange Server Administrator program, the error message
being:

   The object cannot be found in the directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Directory

+--------------------------+
| File name   | Version    | 
+--------------------------+
| Dsamain.exe | 5.5.2530.0 | 
+--------------------------+


To remove the bad data, delete the offending objects, then set the Exchange
Server Garbage Collection Interval to "Every 6 hours," and Tombstone Lifetime to
"2 days," which is the minimum time you can set it for. Then wait two days.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.
