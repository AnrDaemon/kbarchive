TITLE   :XFOR: IMC Events 4020, 4007 with Error 10048
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a network environment where Exchange Server is configured to use Microsoft
Proxy Server 2.0, the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service may fail to start
and logs the following two Event IDs in the application event log:

   4007: MSExchangeIMC
   The following error occurred while trying to bind the TCP/IP listener socket.
   10048

   4020: MSExchangeIMC
   Unable to start the service because WinSock could not be initialized.

CAUSE
=====

For Exchange Server to use the proxy features of Proxy Server 2.0, it must bind
and listen on port 25 of the proxy server. The Exchange Server Internet Mail
Service is attempting to bind to the listener socket for port 25 on the proxy
server, and is failing. This usually indicates another service is already bound
to port 25.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that the Windows NT SMTP service is not running on the proxy server. The
SMTP service will grab and bind to port 25, preventing Exchange Server from
using the port. Verify that no other service or application is using port 25 of
the proxy server. NOTE: Some customers have found their anti-virus product a
contributing factor. Disable the anti-virus product on the proxy server and
attempt to start the service. If this works, please contact the anti-virus
vendor for further assistance.
