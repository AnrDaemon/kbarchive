TITLE   :Err Msg: "Drive Is Not Ready for Use" with Removable Media
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use removable media devices (such as the Iomega Zip drive or the Iomega
Jaz drive) with Windows NT, the following error message may be displayed after
startup:

   The drive is not ready for use; its door may be open. Please check drive
   \<Device>\<Harddisk1>\<Partition1> and make sure that a
   disk is inserted and that the drive door is closed.

NOTE: The <Device>, <Harddisk>, and <Partition> values may be
different, based on your configuration.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because removable media can be reported as malfunctioning
if a cartridge is not present in the removable media device.

When the disk controller BIOS queries a removable media device, it stores the
device status information in memory. At startup, Windows NT sends a query to
determine the status of devices connected to the disk controller. Depending on
the firmware installed, the BIOS revision, or the characteristics of the disk
controller, removable media can be reported as malfunctioning if a cartridge is
not present in the removable media device.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, place a cartridge in the removable media device and
restart Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem may occur on either IDE-based or SCSI-based systems.
