TITLE   :Terminal Server Deletes Novell Search Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Novell NetWare client on Windows NT Server, Terminal
Server Edition, NetWare environment variables, drive mappings, and search drives
that are set in the Novell server logon scripts are deleted from the Windows NT
Terminal Server session envrionments.

CAUSE
=====

Terminal Server's Winlogon process was reengineered to prevent users that log on
more than once from having duplicate volatile environment keys. This was done by
having the Winlogon session delete the \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Volatile Environment
key just prior to processing logon scripts.

==========
