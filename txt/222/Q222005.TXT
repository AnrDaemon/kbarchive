TITLE   :BUG: LNK2001 When Building Applications for MIPS Palm-size PC Th
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbMFC kbHWMIPS kbVC600bug kbGrpDSVCCompiler

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Building a MIPS-based Palm-size PC application that uses floating-point
comparisons may generate errors similar to the following:

   project.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __ltd
   project.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __gtd
   project.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __eqd

CAUSE
=====

The new version of the MIPS compiler for the Palm-size PC incorrectly makes
calls to floating-point comparison functions in later versions of the Windows CE
C run time.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the /QMOC switch to call the earlier versions of the Windows CE
floating-point comparison functions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following code fragment generates the errors listed in the SYMPTOMS section:

       double  a, b;

       if ( a < b ) return -1;
       if ( a > b ) return 1;
       if ( a==b ) return 0;
