SUMMARY
=======

Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 gives you the ability to include
document footers in your Web sites. With document footers, you can include
company information or a Web master's e-mail address on each page. (Document
footers can be used in many ways; these are just examples.) Document footers can
only be used on static content.

Footers are set up on a per-site basis. To use this function, follow these
steps:

1. Open the Internet Services Manager.

2. Expand the name of your computer, and find the Web site that you want to use
   footers on.

3. Right-click on the Web site and choose Properties.

4. Click the Documents tab.

5. Check the Enable Document Footers and enter or browse to the name of the
   footer file you want to include.

6. Click OK.

Using document footers can cause problems in certain conditions. For instance,
because IIS adds this footer to any static content, an Adobe Acrobat (pdf) file
may fail to open.

If you encounter errors using document footers, you may want to try using the
"include" statement in your content. For more information about the "include:
statement, refer to the IIS 5.0 documentation.
