SUMMARY
=======

When you use Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0, you can put content on a
remote Windows NT computer and access it through an IIS virtual directory. When
doing this, you must enter a username and password on the "Connect As..."
button.

This is required because Windows NT 4.0 supports only one set of credentials
(user information) across an authenticated connection and all connections
between two Windows NT computers are authenticated and secure. When you set this
option, you must instruct IIS as to what username and password to use.

Note that all access to the computer sharing the network resources is done in the
context of the person specified in the "Connect As.." dialog box. Therefore,
this account must be both accessible on the remote computer, and have NTFS
permissions to the content shared on the remote computer.
