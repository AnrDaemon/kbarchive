The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

During replication, Microsoft Exchange Server public folders communicate changes
between replicas by sending mail messages.

The Advanced page of the Properties on the server's public information store
allows you to set a replication message size limit. This limit specifies that
individual replication messages smaller than the specified size should be
"batched" in to a single message up to the specified size.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, using the default limit of 300 KB, up to six replication messages
of 50 KB would be batched before being sent on to other replicas. But a single
message of 1 MB would go straight through because it exceeds the specified
limit.

Note that while system messages such as replication messages are unaffected by
message size limits imposed upon the Message Transfer Agent (MTA) or X.400
Connectors, any limits set on external connectors such as the Internet Mail
Service do apply to all messages including replication messages, and can disrupt
replication.
