TITLE   :FIX: Class Not Selected Opening Class Browser From Form Designer
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbMiscTools kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbVS600sp3fix kbGrpDSFox

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When invoking the Class Browser to view the selected object in the Form
Designer, the correct class will not be automatically selected when the Class
Browser loads. This problem does not occur if the object in the Form Designer
has the same name as the underlying class.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Run the following code to demonstrate this problem:

   CREATE CLASS frm AS FORM OF foot NOWAIT
   KEYBOARD "{Y}"
   RELEASE WINDOW 'class designer'
   CREATE FORM footform AS frm FROM foot NOWAIT
   ASELOBJ(xx,1)
   KEYBOARD "{alt+t}c"

Note that the Class Browser loads the appropriate class library (foot), but the
form class (frm) is not selected.

Changing the name of the form object such that it matches the name of the class
will show the correct class selected in the Class Browser. For example, add the
following code immediately after the line containing the ASELOBJ() function:

   xx(1).Name="frm"

and rerun the program. The Class Browser now selects the form class.
