SUMMARY
=======

If the following conditions exist, you may receive a message stating that your
message was deleted without being read.

Conditions
----------

 - User A has a delegate, User D.

 - User A has set up the delegate to receive meeting requests and User A does
   not receive the requests.

 - User B sends a meeting request to User A and later receives a Delivery
   Receipt stating "Your message was deleted without being read."

Scenario
--------

1. User B enables the "Tell me when all messages have been read" tracking option
   in Outlook. This option notifies the message sender that the message has been
   opened by the recipient, including date and time.

   (To do this, on the Tools menu, click Options, click E-Mail Options, click
   Tracking Options, and click to select the "Tell me when all messages have
   been read" check box.)

2. User B sends a message to User A.

3. User A doesn't read the message (the delegate, User D, does), hence the
   following message tracking notification to User B:

-----Original Message-----
From:	User A 
Sent:	Friday, March 12, 1999 12:18 PM
To:	User B
Subject:	Meeting

Your message
      To:	User A
      Subject:	Meeting
      Sent:	3/12/99 12:18 PM

was deleted without being read on 3/12/99 12:18 PM.

4. The delegate, User D, selects the option to delete meeting requests after
   they've been accepted, or simply deletes the request after it is processed.

   (To do this, on the Tools menu, click Options, click E-Mail Options, click
   Advanced E-Mail Options, and click to select the Delete meeting request from
   inbox when responding check box.)

   Enabling this setting removes a meeting request from the Inbox when User D
   responds. If User D accepts the meeting request, the meeting is entered in
   the Calendar.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is no way to prevent this behavior unless you clear the "Tell me when
messages have been read" check box, which is not selected by default.
