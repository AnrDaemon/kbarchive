TITLE   :ZAK Client Setup Does Not Create TEMP Folders Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Zero Administration Kit for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Zero Administration Kit (ZAK) for Windows NT 4.0 Workstation does
not create the TEMP folders correctly when you are installing clients. This can
lead to problems with setting up programs, printing, and other issues related to
the location of the TEMP folder.

CAUSE
=====

The Newtemp.reg file creates registry values that are REG_SZ data types instead
of REG_EXPAND_SZ data types.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, modify the Newtemp.reg file in the I386\Scripts
folder on your distribution share as follows:

   REGEDIT4

   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
   Manager\Environment]
   "temp"=hex(2): 25,53,79,73,74,65,6d,52,6f,6f,74,25,5c,54,45,4d,50
   "tmp"=hex(2): 25,53,79,73,74,65,6d,52,6f,6f,74,25,5c,54,45,4d,50
