TITLE   :Unable to View Modem Sharing Port in Ports Tool
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to view the "Modem Sharing" port in the Ports tool in Control Panel
on your Small Business Server-based computer, "Modem Sharing" may be missing
from the list of available ports.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur after you apply Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 to
your Small Business Server-based computer. When you do so, the Ports.cpl file is
replaced, and this removes the "Modem Sharing" port from the Ports tool.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, view the modem sharing port with the "netmodem"
command:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Command Prompt.

2. At the command prompt, type "netmodem view <Small Business Server
   name>" (without the quotation marks) and then press ENTER, where <Small
   Business Server name> is the name of the computer with shared modems.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft BackOffice Small
Business Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0a and earlier, modem sharing is
listed as an available port in the Ports tool.
