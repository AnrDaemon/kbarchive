TITLE   :STOP 0x21a on Terminal Server Because of Invalid RPC Response
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are using a Terminal Server computer in the role of a member server in a
domain served by a non-Windows NT domain controller running SAMBA. When logging
on to the Terminal Server, the system stops with the following blue screen error
message:

   STOP: c000021a {Fatal System Error}
   The Windows Logon Process system process terminated unexpectedly with a status
   of 0x00000000 (0x00000000,0x0000000)
   The system has been shut down

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, do not use SAMBA 2.0.x as a domain controller.
According to the product's developers, it is not qualified for use as a domain
controller.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SAMBA is a third-party implementation of the SMB networking protocol used by
Windows NT.


The Terminal Server computer does a remote registry query against the domain
controller. An invalid response to this query causes the Terminal Server to
crash.

NOTE: This problem does not occur when using a Windows NT domain controller.
