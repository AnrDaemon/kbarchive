SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a computer running Windows NT 4.0 or later, some or all Remote
Access Service (RAS) and Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) counters may
be missing in Performance Monitor.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of any of the following conditions:

 - The Rasctrs.dll file is missing or corrupted.

 - The Close, Collect, Library, and Open values are missing in the following
   registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RemoteAccess\Performance

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method:

 - Delete the Rasctrs.dll file and replace it with the Rasctrs.dll file from the
   RRAS installation file or from the Windows NT 4.0 service pack CD-ROM.

 - Add the missing registry values:

   1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

   2. Locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RemoteAccess\Performance

   3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
      values:

   Value 0
   Value name: Close
   Data type: REG_SZ
   Data: CloseRasPerformanceData

   Value 1
   Value name: Collect
   Data type: REG_SZ
   Data: CollectRasPerformanceData

   Value 2
   Value name: Library
   Data type: REG_SZ
   Data: rasctrs.dll

   Value 3
   Value name: Open
   Data type: REG_SZ
   Data: OpenRasPerformanceData

   4. Quit Registry Editor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To extract the files from the RRAS installation file, type the command:
"mpri386.exe /T:<directory path> /C" (without the quotation marks), where
<directory path> is the folder in which you want to put the files.

This places all of the files in the folder that you specify. You can then copy
the missing file to the Winnt\System32 folder.
