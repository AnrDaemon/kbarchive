SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to create Macintosh file associations for nondefault file types
on Services for Macintosh (SFM) volumes.

To create these associations, follow these steps:

1. On a Macintosh computer with Resedit installed, open Resedit. (Resedit is a
   file utility found on Macintosh computers.) Opening Resedit brings up the
   browse window.

2. Select one of the files of the file type for which you want to add
   associations.

3. After this file opens, go to the File menu and click "Get info for
   <filename>".

   This brings up a window that shows you the Type and Creator for the file you
   opened.

4. Write down the Type and Creator for the file.

5. On the server running SFM, click Start, click Run, type "winfile.exe"
   (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

6. Go to Macfile, and select Associate.

7. Click Add and then fill in the Creator and Type information you got from
   Resedit. Click OK; the description is optional.

8. In the "Macintosh Document Creator and Type" window, select your newly
   created entry.

9. In the "File with MS-DOS Extensions" drop-down box, type the three-character
   MS-DOS extension of the file type (for example, .xls).

10. Click Associate.
