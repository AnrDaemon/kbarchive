TITLE   :MSClient 3.0 Enforces Source Routing in Token Ring Broadcasts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a Token ring environment using transparent bridging, MS-DOS clients are
unable to obtain an IP address through DHCP. When using static IP addresses,
clients can log on but no servers are available on the network.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the issue, enable source routing on your Token ring bridges to
operate either as Source Route Transparent (SRT) or Source Route only bridges.

If changing your bridge configuration is not an option, the client must be
configured not to rely on broadcasts for network communication. Using static IP
addresses and WINS or a LMHOSTS file for NetBIOS name resolution will allow the
client to function normally.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS-DOS client software mentioned above always includes source routing
information in broadcast frames. Token ring bridges configured for transparent
bridging may discard frames that contain source routing information. In this
environment, broadcasts can only reach stations in the same ring.
