Windows-based optional programs (Microsoft Backup for Windows, Microsoft
Anti-Virus for Windows, and Microsoft Undelete for Windows):

MORE INFORMATION
================

SYSTEM.INI
----------

The following line is added to the [386Enh] section if you install the optional
Windows-based programs:

      device=C:\DOS\VFINTD.386

MemMaker changes the SYSTEM.INI file only when certain options are selected prior
to memory optimization. The Windows SYSTEM.INI file is only changed if you are
running Windows 3.0. The following lists all possible changes to the Windows 3.0
SYSTEM.INI file:

        SYSTEMROMBREAKPOINT=FALSE
      EMMEXCLUDE=A000-FFFF
      EMMINCLUDE=<any w= regions>
      DUALDISPLAY=TRUE                   if b000-b7ff is included
      NOEMMDRIVER=TRUE                   if NOEMS is specified

If you use a permanent swap file, DoubleSpace changes the PermSwapDOSDrive
setting in the SYSTEM.INI file if you compress a drive that contains your
Windows installation.

WINFILE.INI

The following line is added to the [Settings] section if you install the optional
Windows-based programs:

      UNDELETE.DLL=C:\DOS\MSTOOLS.DLL

The following line is added to the [AddOns] section if you install the optional
Windows-based programs:

      MS-DOS Tools Extensions=C:\DOS\MSTOOLS.DLL

PROGMAN.INI

In the [Groups] section, the following line is added if you install the optional
Windows-based programs:
