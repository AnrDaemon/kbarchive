SUMMARY
=======

Patpoly.exe is a file that demonstrates how to draw a polygon so that the entire
polygon, including the border, can be filled with a dithered color in an
application for the Microsoft Windows environment.

It is not possible to fill a polygon and its border with a dithered color using
just a call to the Windows Polygon() Application Programming Interface (API),
because of problems producing the border with a dithered color. Using a NULL pen
doesn't work because not all of the interior and border will be filled. Pens
with a width of one can have only solid colors, so they don't work. Wider pens
can have a dithered color, but because the pen is centered on the polygon border
as defined by the vertex points, the resulting polygon is larger than defined by
the vertices. Also, the PS_INSIDEFRAME pen style does not have any affect when
used with Polygon().

To accomplish the desired result, the PatPolygon() function first creates a
monochrome mask of the polygon in a memory Device Context (DC), and then blits
the mask transparently to the screen using a pattern brush containing the
dithered color.

This sample also demonstrates how to load a Device-Independent Bitmap (DIB)
resource and create a DIB pattern brush with it.
