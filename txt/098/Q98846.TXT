TITLE   :Netwkstasetuid2 (Return 5) Error Means Privilege Problem
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

The undocumented error

   Netwkstasetuid2 (return 5)

occurs when a user tries to log on.

CAUSE
=====

Netwkstasetuid2 is a net API call that logs a user on or off from the network
and runs the logon script. Error # 5 means that access is denied because the
user has insufficient privileges.

Possible reasons:

 - corrupt user password

 - corrupt user account database or file permissions

 - many users logged on at once

RESOLUTION
==========

If too many users logged on at once and initiated the error, have users who
received the error log on again after some time. This often is enough to clear
the problem.

Otherwise, investigate the password, user account database or file permissions
and correct any problems you find.
