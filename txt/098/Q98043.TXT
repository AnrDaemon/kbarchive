======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2 
 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, extended characters (for
example, greater than 127) are remapped if a message containing them is placed
in the Outbox using calls to simple MAPI, then examined in the MSRMT store using
FFAPI.


CAUSE
=====

 - This affects only extended characters.

 - Every extended character is translated to another extended character. The
   translation is systematic but has no obvious pattern.

 - The translation is not related to code pages.

 - FFAPI is not to blame.


 - The Mail Remote for Windows Remote Driver is not at fault--the contents of
   the Sent Mail folder are the same as what FFAPI reports.

 - There is no problem composing a message with extended characters from the
   Mail Remote for Windows User Interface (UI) (using the ALT+<any three
   keypad numerals> method), sending the message and pulling it back again.
   The expected characters are displayed both as they are entered and when the
   message is delivered.

 - If you run the same experiment using Mail for Windows, the message appears to
   be corrupt as soon as it goes to the Outbox.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Simple MAPI from
version 3.0, 3.0a, or 3.2 of Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
