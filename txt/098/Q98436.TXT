SUMMARY
=======

The code example below demonstrates how to create a default text button on an
input screen. For example, you may want the OK button to be chosen by default
when the ENTER key is pressed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a default text button:

1. Place the text button(s) on the .SCX screen.

2. Draw a thicker outline around the button that is to be the default button.
   (This gives the appearance of a default button, but does not actually make
   this the default button. The ON KEY command is what controls the action of
   the "default" button.)

3. Generate the .SCX screen into a format file.

4. Open the .FMT file as a program and enter code above and below the generated
   screen code so that it resembles the following:

      CLEAR
      SET PROCEDURE TO <This FMT Filename>
      STORE 0 TO mchoice
      SET TALK OFF
      SET CONFIRM OFF
      ON KEY = 13 DO veri    && This is the carriage return trap.
      STORE 1 TO a
      STORE "This is z" TO z
