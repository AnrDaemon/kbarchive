SUMMARY
=======

TriPeaks is a single-player card game. The object of TriPeaks is to earn money
by clearing cards from the three peaks. Sometimes you will clear the three
peaks, sometimes not. You play by moving the cards from the peaks to the pile
according to the rules.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The object of TriPeaks is to earn money, not to clear all three peaks every
time. So it is not always the best idea to try to clear all three peaks.
Sometimes it can be wise to deal a new hand rather than lose $5 for every card
you turn over in the face-down pile.

If you have a choice between two cards, remove the card from the TriPeaks area
that will turn over the largest number of cards. In general, keep as many cards
as possible in the TriPeaks area face up.

Keep track of what cards have been played. For example, if you know that all four
of the seven cards have been played, and you have sixes and eights face up on
the TriPeaks area, it is probably a good idea to redeal.

You can only remove cards from the TriPeak area if they are one card lower or
higher in rank than the current card in the face-up pile. Note: Aces are
considered one higher than Kings and one lower than Two cards. This means you
can place an Ace on a King and then place a Two on the Ace.

You can move any card from the face-down pile to the face-up pile, but each time
you do so, you lose money.
