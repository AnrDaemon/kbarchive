The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The printing commands ? and @ SAY use different command sets. There are a
variety of command combinations that affect output to the printer, screen, and
text files, and there are several options that can affect formatting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

OUTPUT TO THE PRINTER
---------------------

To Use ?
--------

      SET PRINT ON
      ? "Print String"
      SET PRINT OFF
      SET PRINT TO

To Use @ ... SAY
----------------

      SET DEVICE TO PRINT
      @ 1,1 SAY "Print String"
      SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
      SET PRINT TO

To Use Both
-----------

      SET PRINT ON
      SET DEVICE TO PRINT
      ? "This is a ?"
      @ 2,1 SAY "@ SAY"
      SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
      SET PRINT OFF
      SET PRINT TO

Notes
-----

 - SET PRINT ON does NOT direct output from @ ... SAY commands.

 - SET DEVICE TO PRINT does NOT direct output from ?.

 - Output from ? will be printed with the current screen font.

 - SET PRINT TO is needed to close the print job. Without it, if there is an
   error during printing, the Macintosh will remain in a background conversation
   with the printer.

 - The output will be sent to a buffer and will not be released until the SET
   PRINT TO command is encountered. An EJECT or SET PRINT TO command can be
   inserted within the print job to force a dump of the buffer and complete the
   page feed.

 - SET CONSOLE OFF will prevent the output from being echoed to the screen.

 - SET DEVICE TO PRINT can be issued before SET PRINT ON with the same results.
   Likewise, the order of SET DEVICE TO SCREEN and SET PRINT OFF is
   interchangeable.

OUTPUT TO TEXT FILE
-------------------

To Use ?
--------

      SET ALTERNATE TO "filename"
      SET ALTERNATE ON
      ? "Text String"
      SET ALTERNATE OFF
      SET ALTERNATE TO

To Use @ ... SAY
----------------

      SET PRINTER TO "filename"
      SET DEVICE TO PRINT
      @ 1,1 SAY "Text String"
      SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
      SET PRINTER TO

Notes
-----

 - If output is not to be echoed to the screen, issue SET CONSOLE OFF. This
   command does not work in interactive mode. It must be issued from a program.

 - The ? command issues a carriage return before outputting, which creates a new
   line each time ? is issued. To prevent this from occurring, use the ??
   command.
