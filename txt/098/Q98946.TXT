SUMMARY
=======

Windows 3.0 and 3.0a File Manager does not support formatting 2.8-megabyte (MB)
floppy disks. To format a 2.8-MB floppy disk, you must use the MS-DOS FORMAT
command.

Windows 3.1 File Manager does support the formatting of 2.8-MB floppy disks. When
the File Manager detects a 2.8-MB disk, File Manager displays a 2.8-MB option in
the Format Disk dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
