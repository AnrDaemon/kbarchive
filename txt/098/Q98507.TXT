SYMPTOMS
========

If you have configured your printer driver for manual feed and you print to a
Hewlett-Packard (HP) PaintJet XL, the printer takes the paper from the paper
tray if you issue the Print command before you place a piece of paper in the
manual feeder.

CAUSE
=====

If you issue the Print command and no paper has been placed in the manual
feeder, the printer draws paper from the paper tray and pauses. The Manual Feed
Mode light comes on, and Print Manager prompts you to insert paper. When you
choose OK (even after placing paper in the manual feeder), the output is printed
on the page taken from the paper tray.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this situation, place a piece of paper in the manual feeder
before you issue the Print command. When Print Manager asks for paper to be
inserted, choose OK; the page will be manually fed to the printer.
