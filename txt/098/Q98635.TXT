TITLE   :Interlnk Client Cannot Access Drives on Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

An Interlnk client computer running MS-DOS version 3.3 or earlier cannot access
a partition on a server machine if either of the following are true:

 - The partition is larger than 32 megabytes (MB)

 - The partition is compressed with DoubleSpace

From the client computer, you can change to the drive letter assigned to the
server's drive; however, after you do, you receive the following error message:

   Non-DOS disk error reading drive G:
   Abort, Retry, Fail?

For example, if the letter G is assigned to the server's compressed drive (for
example, drive C), you can change to the "G:\>" prompt, but when you try to
access the drive with an MS-DOS command (DIR, MD, CD, and so on), you receive
the error noted above.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Interlnk functions as a redirector. The client's
version of MS-DOS is allowed to access drives on the server as if they were
local drives. MS-DOS 3.x simply doesn't know how to access these drives.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

 - Upgrade the client to MS-DOS version 4.01 or later.

-or-

 - Reverse the Interlnk client/server configuration (that is, make the MS-DOS 6
   or 6.2 machine the client and the MS-DOS 3.x machine the server).
