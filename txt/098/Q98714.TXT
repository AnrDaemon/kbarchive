TITLE   :Mac ARA: Apple Modem and Shiva Dial-In May Produce Give Ups
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the built-in Apple 2400 modem and Shiva Dial-In to access version
3.0 or 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, the following error message
may appear:

   Looking for Microsoft Mail Server: Give Up

CAUSE
=====

Shiva Dial-In version 3.6.6 does not ship with an Apple-brand initialization
string for the modem. Users should add or change one of the existing strings.

RESOLUTION
==========

To change the name of an existing string, do the following:

1. Launch the Shiva Modems utility and open the Mac Portable string.

2. Change the name if you want. Next, change the dial string by placing the
   insertion point just past the "Z" in "ATZ", pressing the DELETE key, then
   typing an ampersand (&) and an "F". (IMPORTANT: Do not simply highlight
   the string and replace it; place the insertion point in the string and
   backspace out any unwanted information.) The string should be the following:

   AT&FS37=6&C1&D3&K4&Q0

MORE INFORMATION
================

Shiva is locking out all possible settings on the 2400 modem with a "vanilla"
v.22bis connection, no v.42bis or MNP. This string should be successful with
almost any Hayes-compatible 2400 v.42bis/MNP data/fax modem.

252-6400.
