======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a Windows 3.0 video display driver (VDD) on a Packard Bell machine
and EMM386.EXE is installed, you receive one of the following error messages
when you run Windows in 386 enhanced mode:

   The Winmemsize in SYSTEM.INI is too large

   -or-

   Kernel is corrupted

In addition, these same problems can occur when you use the Windows 3.1 Packard
Bell driver, HTVDD.386 VDD.


CAUSE
=====

Although HTVDD.386 is a Windows 3.1 VDD, it still uses the C600-C7FF range. This
situation is caused by a problem in the Packard Bell VDD, not Windows 3.1 or the
Windows 3.1 Device Developer Kit (DDK).

On some Packard Bell systems, the video BIOS is at E000 and C000-DFFF is free (by
default). EMM386.EXE uses this as range as upper memory blocks (UMBs). If you
are using a Windows 3.0 video display driver, Windows ignores anything loaded in
the C600-C7FF range. This can cause various problems in Windows, including
failure to run and failure of the Microsoft Backup for Windows compatibility
test.

WORKAROUND
==========

Windows 3.0
-----------

Add the X=C600-C7FF parameter to the EMM386.EXE command line in the CONFIG.SYS
file.

Windows 3.1
-----------

You can either use a Windows 3.1 video display driver (such as the standard VGA
driver), or add the X=C600-C7FF parameter to the EMM386.EXE command line in the
CONFIG.SYS file.
