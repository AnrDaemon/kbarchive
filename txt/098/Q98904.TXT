The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Although Microsoft Defragmenter (Defrag) sorts directories and files, no
detectable system activity occurs while Defrag is running. The Power and
Advanced Power Management (APM) utilities may assume the system is idle and
therefore suspend the system. Pressing the ESC key causes an interrupt, making
the system resume its activities.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Defrag does not query for currently active Power or APM services. If the system
goes into an idle state while Defrag is running, you should press the ESC key.
Do NOT reboot or turn the machine off; doing so can lead to data corruption.

To prevent Power from interrupting Defrag, disable Power and APM services before
running Defrag. Microsoft recommends that you run your laptop computer from an
AC outlet when you run Defrag.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 6.20 power.exe
