SUMMARY
=======

TetraVex is a challenging computer brain teaser. The object of the game is to
fill the grid with the tiles so that the patterns on the adjacent edges of each
tile match, much like aligning domino tiles.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The playing area of TetraVex consists of a tray and anywhere from 4 to 36 tiles.
The object of the game is to place all the tiles in the tray so that the
characters on the adjacent edges of each tile match. You can place any tile
anywhere in the tray, but you cannot place a tile in the tray if its edges do
not match all of its neighbors.

To Start a New Game
-------------------

From the Game menu, click New Game from the File menu or press F2.

To Move a Tile
--------------

Just drag the tile to its new location. If the tile cannot be placed in the
position you intended, it will not be left in that space.

To Bolt Down a Tile
-------------------

If you are sure of the new tile position, double-click it. A bolt appears on the
tile. To unbolt a tile, simply double-click again, and the bolt disappears.

To Move a Group of Tiles in the Tray
------------------------------------

Click and drag the group of attached tiles with the right mouse button.

To "bolt down" a group of tiles, double-click the group of attached tiles with
the right mouse button.
