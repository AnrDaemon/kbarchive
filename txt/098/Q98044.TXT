TITLE   :PC WRmt: Setup May Fail If Program Manager Not Running
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Microsoft Windows Program Manager is not running when you start the Setup
program for version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, the Setup program
attempts to build the Program Manager group but cannot. The following error
message is generated:

   Cannot establish DDE link to Program Manager - Retry/Cancel.

After you select Cancel, a message appears stating that Mail is not installed
correctly and will not function. After you select Exit Install, a sharing
violation occurs.

Mail Remote for Windows does run correctly after installation.

CAUSE
=====

Setup is calling standard Setup Toolkit routines to attempt to create a Program
Manager group and item. Any application that uses Setup Toolkit will experience
the same problem.

It was assumed this problem would appear with any shell other than Program
Manager. However, it appears that Norton Desktop traps DDE calls to the Program
Manager and also avoids this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
