TITLE   :Mac LDF: Mail Tools Err Msg: File Unrecognizable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When rebuilding a local data file with version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for
AppleTalk Networks, the Mail Tools application may return the following error
message:

   File Unrecognizable

It is possible the error is reported incorrectly, and the local data file is
still capable of being rebuilt.

CAUSE
=====

The Mail Tools local mail rebuild routine does not recover messages for which no
parent folder exists. In other words, if all the messages are in a folder called
Local Folder, but the information about the existence of Local Folder is
corrupt, then Mail Tools will not attempt to recover the messages, because it
does not know where they belong. Likewise, if the corruption occurs in the local
data file's header, Mail Tools will return the "File Unrecognizable" error
message.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to version 3.1a of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, and run the
Mail Tools from that version. For information about how to obtain the upgrade,
please call Microsoft Sales at (800) 227-4679.
