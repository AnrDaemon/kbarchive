SUMMARY
=======

If the Paste command is unavailable (dimmed) after you copy an image from
Microsoft Encarta, you may be experiencing a video driver conflict.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, use any of the following three workarounds:

 - If the video driver is from a third party video card manufacturer, verify
   that it is the latest version of the driver.

 - Use an alternate driver supplied by the manufacturer. Check Windows Setup for
   available video drivers.

 - Install the Windows VGA driver.
