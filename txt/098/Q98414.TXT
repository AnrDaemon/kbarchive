SUMMARY
=======

MIDI sound will not play through the PC speaker if you are using the IBM M-
Audio sound card. Wave sound will play from the PC speaker.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IBM M-Audio sound card can play sound through the internal PC speaker. MIDI
sound cannot play through the PC speaker. The PC speaker is only capable of
playing wave sounds. A set of external speakers (or headphones) plugged into the
card (bottom two jacks) provide MIDI capabilities.

To set the option to use the PC speaker, start Control Panel, click Drivers,
select "IBM M-Audio sound driver", and click Setup.

If you still can't play MIDI sound, do the following in Windows 3.x:

1. Download the latest drivers from the Microsoft Download Service (IBM.EXE).
   There is just one driver to install in Control Panel Drivers for all types of
   sound (unlike some that may require multiple drivers).

2. In the MIDI Mapper set 1 through 12 in the port column to the IBM choice and
   13 through 16 on none.
