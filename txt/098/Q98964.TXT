The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use Remote Server Connection (RSC) and version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail
for AppleTalk Networks, the following errors may occur.

NOTE: Possible workarounds are listed following each error.

"Time Out Value Exceeded" Error in Session Log
----------------------------------------------

Possible cause: AppleTalk Remote Access (ARA) on the answering server has been
configured to allow access to the entire network.

Workaround: Open the Remote Access Setup Control Panel and change the setting to
Allow Access To This Macintosh Only.

"Can't Find Site <site name>" Error in Session Log
--------------------------------------------------

The following is an example of the Session Log when this error occurs:

   Connected to zone ZONE A
   Scanning for site A
   Transferring data to site A
   Can't find site A
   Performing full zone scan
   ...

Possible cause: The ARA connection document has been named after the server you
are calling. However, the document should correspond to the mail site.

Workaround: Rename the connection document in System Folder:Preferences:MS Mail
Remote Sites.

When the entry "Transferring data to site A" appears in the log, it means that
the Remote Server Connection has told the local server to begin transferring
mail to the other site. If the local server cannot find the bridge server on the
other site, it returns the "Can't find site A" error message to the Remote
Server Connection.

Additional possible cause: The AppleTalk network is poorly terminated.

Workaround: Check both sides of the LocalTalk network for correct termination.

Mail Servers Connect But No Mail or Data Is Transferred,

Although the Status Window Reflects Data was Transferred
--------------------------------------------------------

Possible cause: You are using Microsoft Mail Server version 3.1.

There are some problems with the original Mail 3.1 release where remote servers
connect but do not exchange any data.

Workaround: This problem is corrected in the version 3.1a release of the
Microsoft Mail Server. To obtain the latest version of the mail server, contact
Microsoft Sales at (800) 227-4679.

Mail Server Dials Continuously
------------------------------

Possible cause: Urgent mail has been sent and you are using Microsoft Mail Server
version 3.1.

There are some problems with the original Mail 3.1 release where remote servers
attempt to process urgent mail and dial continuously. The servers connect, but
the message is not transmitted due to the problem explained above. Mail
therefore continues to attempt to send the message.

Workaround: This problem is corrected in the version 3.1a release of the
Microsoft Mail Server. To obtain the latest version of the mail server, contact
Microsoft Sales at (800) 227-4679.

There Are No Connection Documents Listed in the

Configuration Dialog Box of the Remote Server Connection (RSC)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Possible cause: The RSC program has not been quit from since the ARA document was
saved to the MS Mail Remote sites folder.

Workaround: Quit the RSC program, and then restart it.
