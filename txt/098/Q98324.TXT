TITLE   :BUG: Excel GP Faults When Passing Intersection
PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Software Development Kits
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Excel Software Development Kit 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Excel causes a general protection (GP) fault when attempting to pass
an intersection to a DLL/XLL function registered as data type "R". For example,
consider the following dynamic-link library (DLL) function declaration:

      void __export CALLBACK Test (LPXLOPER lpxl)

Excel causes a GP fault if Test is called with an intersection under the
following circumstances:

 - The references joined by the union operator intersect

 - The references are passed using defined names

The following call to Test will crash Excel if range1 and range2 intersect:

      =Test(range1 range2)

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a problem in Excel.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two possible workarounds for this problem:

 - If intersections may be passed to a DLL function, avoid the use of data type
   "R" (XLOPER) if possible. Use data type "P" (OPER) instead and the
   intersection will be passed as an array.

 - Implement a "wrapper" macro function. For information on this method, query
   on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   prod(xlsdk) and nonadjacent

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Excel version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as soon as it
becomes available.
