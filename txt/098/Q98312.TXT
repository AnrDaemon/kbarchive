The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you run MS-DOS 6.0 Setup without any parameters, your only choice for the
destination of the MS-DOS 6.0 files is drive C. To use another drive, use the
procedure in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: You must have at least 3-4 megabytes of free space on drive C to use this
procedure.

1. Run Setup with the /Q switch by typing the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt and then pressing ENTER:

   " setup /q" (without the quotation marks)

2. Press ENTER at the Welcome to Setup screen.

3. The next screen gives you the option to change your computer type, MS-DOS
   path, and display type. Use the arrow keys to select MS-DOS Path, then press
   ENTER.

4. Type the drive and path to which you want to install MS-DOS.

5. To transfer the new system files (IO.SYS, MS-DOS.SYS, COMMAND.COM, and
   DBLSPACE.BIN) to the proper places on your boot drive, type the following and
   then press ENTER:

   " setup /" (without the quotation marks)

You have now upgraded your operating system to MS-DOS 6.0. The boot drive (C)
contains the new system files, and the path you specified in step 4 contains all
the MS-DOS programs and drivers (92 files total).
