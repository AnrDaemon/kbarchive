-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A button in a CDialogBar object is disabled automatically if the command
routing does not contain a command handler function for the button.

To enable a button in a CDialogBar object, the command routing must include
a command handler for the button. A button command handler can be an
ON_BN_CLICKED(), ON_COMMAND(), or ON_COMMAND_UI() message handler and it
must appear in the message map of an object in the command routing. If the
parent of the CDialogBar object is a CFrameWnd object, then the command is
handled by the active child window or view, by the document attached to the
view, by the frame window, and by the application (CWinApp object).

NOTE: Because the CDialogBar object is not included in the routing
scheme, the ON_BN_CLICKED() or ON_COMMAND() handler must be placed in one
of the objects mentioned above that is in the routing scheme and not in the
CDialogBar class.

For more information on command routing, see the "Command Routing" section
in Chapter 3 of the "Class Library Reference" manual. In Visual C++ 32-bit
Edition, version 4.0, see both the "Command Routing" topic of the
"Programming with MFC: Overview" in the Books Online and the MFC Technical
Note 31, Control Bars.
