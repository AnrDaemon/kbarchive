TITLE   :3Server Restore Fails on HPFS Volumes
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================

With Microsoft LAN Manager 2.1, restoring files to a 3Server HPFS partition
using Backman or Backup2 can corrupt files. 3Backup and 3Restore appear to
work correctly.

The problem occurs when you backup and restore to a 3Server HPFS partition
(not to a 3Server FAT partition or to a PC server HPFS partition)on the
same system the tape drive is on. Therefore the workaround is to restore
the data across the net. The two options are:

1. Restore data from another system with a tape drive

2. Restore data to another server and then copy it over.

STATUS
======

This was corrected with the 2.2 tape.

Additional query words: 2.10 2.1
