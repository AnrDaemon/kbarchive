SUMMARY
=======

The Intel TokenExpress ISA16/s card as a replacement for the Intel TokenExpress
16/4 card. The card is software configurable; Intel provides a new NDIS driver
for it.

The ISA16/s is not available as an option with Windows for Workgroups 3.1, except
through the workaround described below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. In Windows for Workgroups, select the Olicom 16/4 Token_Ring Adapter.

   Note: For a fresh installation of Windows for Workgroups, this card comes up
   as a default.

2. Copy the OLITOK.DOS driver file from the MSLANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\OLITOK
   directory on diskette #2 of the TokenExpress LAN Adapter to the Windows for
   Workgroups default subdirectory.

3. Remark out the parameters under MS$OLI164 section in the Windows for
   Workgroups PROTOCOL.INI file.

4. Copy the PROTOCOL.INI entries from the MSLANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\OLITOK directory
   on TokenExpress diskette #2 into the Windows for Workgroups PROTOCOL.INI
   MS$OLI164 section.

   The following is a modified MS$OLI164 section:

   [MS$OLI164]
 drivername = OLITOK$
 maxtransmits = 4
 maxrequests = 1
 recbufsize = 2540
 recbufcount = 4
 adapter = 1

5. Save the file and reboot.
