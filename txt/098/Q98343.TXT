To create a text hot spot that will be displayed with a given color and
without an underline by the Multimedia Viewer, follow these steps:

1. Begin the hidden text for the hot spot with the division sign character "%".
   If you are using the Viewer Topic Editor to create the hot spot, choose the
   Jump To 'jump_or_command' Viewer Element. Then select the None option button
   in the Hot Spot Formatting group box. The % character turns off the standard
   underline and color. For more information, see the documentation for the \v
   RTF token in Chapter 2 of the Microsoft Multimedia Viewer 2.0 "Technical
   Reference."

2. In Word for Windows, format the hot spot text with the desired color. To do
   this:

   a. Select the hot spot text

   b. From the Word 6.0x Format menu, choose Font (from the Word 2.0x Font menu,
      choose Character)

   c. Set the desired color
