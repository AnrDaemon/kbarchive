-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, versions 2.1b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the version 2.1 or 3.0 Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and
OfficeVision (PROFS Gateway) Import option from within the Microsoft Mail
Administrator program, the PROFS user list may not be imported into the
Microsoft Mail postoffice.

For the PROFS gateway, this means that the Nickname file is not downloaded to the
postoffice. The PROFS gateway reports that the import request file of 720 bytes
is transferred to the VM host, but no user list is transferred back down to the
postoffice.

CAUSE
=====

Three known causes of this problem and their resolutions are:

 - The Nickname file is not designated in the PWAINIT DATA file on the VM host
   ID.

   In the PWAINIT DATA file, there is a parameter that designates the name of the
   system Nickname file. If the filename and file type of the system nickname
   file are missing, the PROFS USERS file cannot be generated and the PROFS user
   fails to download.

 - The PROFS USERS file is missing or was not created on the gateway VM ID 191
   disk.

   The VM Administrator should check the VM ID 191 disk to ensure that the PROFS
   USERS file has not been deleted or renamed.

   This USERS file is automatically created when the host side of the gateway is
   started, if the NICKNAME is designated in the PWAINIT DATA file and the PROFS
   USERS file does not already exist.

   To regenerate the PROFS USERS file, restart the VM ID.

 - The node created within the Administrator program does not match nodes in the
   PROFS Nickname files on the host.

   When you mail from a Microsoft Mail postoffice to PROFS, the addressing is
   simplified by creating a node within the Mail Administrator program (select
   Gateway, PROFS, Node, Create).

   When you use the gateway Import option, the nodes selected are searched for
   within the PROFS USERS file on the host. The user names corresponding to the
   selected nodes are then downloaded to Microsoft Mail. These names are then
   automatically imported into the postoffice.
