The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

According to AST, COM 4 will not be available on the AST Premium Exec 3/25 SLC
Notebook computer unless you properly load the AST CCU.EXE driver in the
CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The CCU.EXE driver configures COM 4 for the PCMCIA Card (an AST credit-card size
Ethernet/modem card). The driver must be loaded in conventional memory. The
upper memory area (UMA) D000-DFFF must be excluded when using the PCMCIA Card in
conjunction with the CCU.EXE driver. Include the following device entries in the
CONFIG.SYS file:

   DEVICE=C:\CCU.EXE
   DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
   DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE [RAM | NOEMS] X=D000-DFFF

If you MS-DOS MemMaker with aggressive scanning of upper memory settings,
HIGHSCAN will be added to the EMM386.EXE device line in the CONFIG.SYS file. If
COM 4 is not recognized on the AST Premium Exec after loading HIGHSCAN, run
MEMMAKER /UNDO, and then rerun MemMaker with conservative settings.

The PCMCIA Card is manufactured by AST, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
