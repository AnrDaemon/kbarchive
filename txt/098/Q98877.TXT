PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks may be unable to
print to some early Apple LaserWriters that contain a ROM version earlier than
2.0. You may receive "Offending Command" PostScript errors or the print job may
not be processed.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can check the specific ROM version by inspecting the printer start page,
which prints when you turn on the LaserWriter's power. This page contains the
name of the printer in its heading and then a series of graphics. The ROM
version is listed in the lower-left corner of the graphic resembling a line
chart. If this version is earlier than version 2.0, Microsoft Mail may not print
correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
