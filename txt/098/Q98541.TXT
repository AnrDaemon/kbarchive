-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In addition to providing remote access to another computer's drives, Interlnk
allows you to use printers on the server computer by redirecting output from an
unused LPT port on the client machine to the server.

If you attempt to print to a redirected LPT port from within Windows 3.1, the
client computer may display the following error message:

   LPT2 is not present on your computer. Choose the Printer option in Control
   Panel or the Printer Setup command in Print Manager to assign an installed
   port to you printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows attempts to write the data directly to the LPT2 port, bypassing MS-DOS
and Interlnk. Using MS-DOS to print permits the Interlnk client to redirect LPT2
output and allow the Interlnk server to receive and print the job on the
server's parallel port.

To allow Interlnk to capture print jobs from Windows, do the following:

1. In Control Panel, choose Printers.

2. Choose Connect, clear the Fast Printing Direct To Port check box, then choose
   OK.

3. Choose Close and then quit Control Panel.
