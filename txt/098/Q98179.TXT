-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article covers two situations that result in the following error message:

   You started MemMaker with the /SESSION switch. This is an incorrect use of
   this switch, which is for MemMaker's use during optimization an is not
   intended to be typed at the command prompt.


These situations are described in the following sections:

 - MemMaker Is Run Without an AUTOEXEC.BAT File

 - Documentation Error in "Microsoft MS-DOS 6.0 User's Guide"

MORE INFORMATION
================

MemMaker Is Run Without an AUTOEXEC.BAT File
--------------------------------------------

If you run MemMaker without an AUTOEXEC.BAT file in the root of your boot drive,
MemMaker creates an AUTOEXEC.BAT file with a single line, similar to the
following:

   C:\DOS\MEMMAKER.EXE /SESSION:26493

MemMaker uses this line to restart itself when performing reboots during memory
optimization. After MemMaker finishes, it does not remove this line. When you
later restart your computer, the above error message is displayed. You are then
given the option to Restore Files or Cancel; choosing either option brings you
to the MS-DOS command prompt. To avoid receiving this error message every time
you start your computer, remove the MEMMAKER.EXE line from your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file.

Documentation Error in "Microsoft MS-DOS  User's Guide"
-------------------------------------------------------

On page 160 of the "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide" for version 6.0 and 6.2, the
procedure titled "To free enough conventional memory to run MemMaker" includes
an error in step 4. You are instructed to bypass all but the following commands
in the CONFIG.SYS file:

   HIMEM.SYS
   EMM386.EXE
   SHELL

If you bypass the command line loading CHKSTATE.SYS, the error message is
displayed and the procedure fails. To make this procedure work correctly, make
sure you do not bypass CHKSTATE.SYS.
