-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run SCHDIST.EXE from Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows as an idle process
of DISPATCH.EXE from version 3.0 or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, as
outlined in the Schedule+ "Administrator's Guide," SCHDIST.EXE stops running and
an error message appears.

After you create the batch file and run DISPATCH.EXE with the
-i"<batchfile>" option (where <batchfile> is the name of the batch
file), the batch file stops and the following error message appears:

   schdist.exe -br00:01:00 terminated with exit code 1

DISPATCH.EXE cannot find the batch file referenced in the -i parameter.

RESOLUTION
==========

Store the batch file in the same directory where DISPATCH.EXE and SCHDIST.EXE
are stored, or fully qualify the path to the batch file in the -i parameter. For
example:

     dispatch -dmn -i"f:\sch.bat"

Additional query words: schedule plus 1.00 3.00 3.20 err msg errmsg alert
