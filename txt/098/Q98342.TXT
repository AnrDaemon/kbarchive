SUMMARY
=======

The names and titles of the groups in a Multimedia Viewer version 2.0 title can
be retrieved by using the Viewer function TitleGetInfo() with a value of 13 for
the iInfoMsg parameter. The lParam2 parameter for TitleGetInfo() should be a far
pointer to a text buffer to receive the group name and title. TitleGetInfo()
writes a string of the form <groupname>.grp"<TitleName>" to this
buffer. The LOWORD of lParam1 should specify the maximum number of characters to
copy into the buffer supplied in lParam2, including the NULL terminator. The
HIWORD of lParam1 should be the number of the group whose name and title should
be retrieved. The groups in a title are numbered consecutively, starting at 0.
TitleGetInfo() returns -1 if it is passed a group number that does not exist in
the title.

The following code loops through the groups in a title, and displays a message
box with the contents of the buffer returned from TitleGetInfo():

      #define MAXBUF 255
      int icount;
      char szBuf[MAXBUF];
      HANDLE hTitle;

      hTitle=TitleOpen("test");
      icount=0;
      while (TitleGetInfo(hTitle,13,MAKELONG(MAXBUF,icount),
                 (LONG)(LPSTR)szBuf)!=-1L)
      {
          MessageBox(NULL,szBuf,"Groups",MB_OK);
          icount++;
      }
