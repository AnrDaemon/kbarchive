TITLE   :NDIS Driver Problems with Thomas Conrad Ethernet Cards
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

The NE2000 NDIS driver that ships with LAN Manager 2.1a and 2.2 does not load at
startup because it does not work with the /TC5043 and /TC5045 Ethernet card
adapters from Thomas Conrad Corporation.

CAUSE
=====

Although these cards are supposed to be an exact clone of the NE2000 card (using
the St. Nick chipset) Thomas Conrad Corp. has confirmed a problem with their
Ethernet adapters when used with LAN Manager versions 2.1a and 2.2.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is a PROM upgrade that solves the problem. You can obtain it by calling
Thomas Conrad Corp. at (800) 332-8683. You can either use the old driver (from
LAN Manager 2.1) or upgrade the PROM on the adapter card.
