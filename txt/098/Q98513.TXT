======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using an AMI or Phoenix BIOS, you may receive the following
EMM386.EXE error message even though you have more than 384 kilobytes (K) of
extended memory:

   Insufficient memory for UMBs or virtual HMA

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, modify your BIOS CMOS settings to disable "Fast A20
Gating." For more information, contact your hardware vendor.

NOTE: This message may also appear on systems with only 384K of extended memory
if MS-DOS is loaded high. The solution is to exclude 64K from EMM386.EXE to
accommodate loading MS-DOS high.
