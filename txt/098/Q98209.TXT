The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (FFAPI), versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Developers using the Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit: File Format API
for Gateways and Applications (FFAPI) should note that the message body may
begin with a blank line consisting of a carriage return (CR), a line feed (LF),
or both (CRLF).

Versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows place an initial blank line
within the body of the message. Unlike versions 2.1 and earlier, which do not
include a blank line. Versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for MS-DOS do not
place a blank line at the beginning of the message body.

FFAPI developers interpreting information in the main body of a message should be
aware of the blank line the Windows client places in the beginning of the
message body.

NOTE: The blank like is controlled by the -F parameter of FFAPI. Please consult
the Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit manual for detailed information
about this command.
