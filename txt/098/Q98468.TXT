TITLE   :OS/2 2.0 Doesn't Recognize DoubleSpace Volumes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 in a dual-boot configuration with IBM OS/2
operating system version 2.0, you cannot access any DoubleSpace volumes that are
created while running MS-DOS. Also, if the boot drive is compressed, the OS/2
dual-boot feature does not work. Instead, you may receive the following error
message:

   SYS0019: The drive is currently write-protected.

CAUSE
=====

OS/2 version 2.0 is unaware of the DoubleSpace system files and does not load
them during the OS/2 boot sequence. As a result, any data or program files that
are located in the DoubleSpace volume are not accessible to the OS/2 operating
system.

IBM OS/2 version 2.0 is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
