======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using Razzle Dazzle version 1.0 and the temporary file for this
screen saver is located on a DoubleSpace-compressed drive, you may encounter
problems returning to your system after the screen saver has engaged. The video
screen may become unclear and difficult to read.

CAUSE
=====

Razzle Dazzle writes a temporary file to your hard disk drive for its use. Video
corruption occurs because the screen saver cannot write to the temporary file
when that file is located on a compressed drive.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, point the temporary file to the uncompressed drive. To
do this, change the following line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file from:

   C:\RAZDAZ\DAZTSR /fC:\RAZDAZ\ /QN /S=300 /e or /x

to:

   C:\RAZDAZ\DAZTSR /fC:\RAZDAZ\ /QN /S=300 /IH:\XXXXXXXX.$$$

where "H:" represents the host (uncompressed) drive and "XXXXXXXX" is the
temporary filename.
