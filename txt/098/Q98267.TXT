======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows Sound System ProofReader utility may not work with
Microsoft Excel workbook sheets if the sheets have extended filenames greater
than 20 characters: the ProofReader utility may respond incorrectly or may not
not have any sound.

MORE INFORMATION
================

ProofReader can be installed as an option under Microsoft Excel when you install
the Windows Sound System. This utility allows you to proofread different data
types that you select.

When you proofread data from selected cells, you may not be able to hear the
sounds or the ProofReader utility may not respond correctly. However, proofing
data that you enter seems to work correctly.

Workaround
----------

To work around this problem, save the sheet with an extended filename of 20
characters or less.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
