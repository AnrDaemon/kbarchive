When the parameter to the AddHead() or AddTail() member functions of
CObList specifies a pointer to an object derived from CObList, the
functions add all the items specified in the argument object to the
list. To add the CObList object to the list, the application must cast
the CObList pointer to a CObject pointer.

In the CObList class, the AddHead() and AddTail() functions accept
either a "CObject *" or a "CObList *" argument. When the functions
receive a "CObList *", the functions add all the items in the
specified list to the list. To add the list object to another list,
cast the list pointer to a CObject pointer. The following sample code
demonstrates the differences between these methods.

Sample Code
-----------

      // adds all of the CObject items contained in listSrc to listTarget
      listTarget.AddTail(&listSrc);

      // adds listSrc as a CObList object to listTarget
      listTarget.AddTail((CObject *)&listSrc);
