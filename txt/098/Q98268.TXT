TITLE   :PRB: Metafiles and Palettes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The metafile list inside of GDI's heap grows by a WORD.

CAUSE
=====

This happens each time an application selects a palette into a metafile device
context (DC).

RESOLUTION
==========

If a palette is never deleted, then this block is never freed and keeps on
growing until GDI's heap fills and the system crashes.

This problem is heightened by the fact that the application typically selects the
default stock palette back in so the application can free its custom palette.
Because an application cannot delete the default stock palette, this memory is
never freed inside of GDI's heap.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Below is the code necessary to correct the problem. There are no rules regarding
when to call FlushGDIHeap(); however, Microsoft recommends doing this after a
major operation, such as after saving a file or printing. Determining whether
you need to flush the GDI heap depends on how often your application selects in
a palette in a metafile. Optionally, you could periodically call TOOLHELP and
see if the GDI resources are greater than X%.

Sample Code
-----------

   SEG       segGDI, segNil;
   HANDLE    hPalSys;
   int       iPal;
   BOOL      fEnableFlushHeap;

   /* ---------------------------------------------
      The following code is used to initialize the
      FlushGDIHeap function.

     HANDLE hGDISegment;

     /* Called once during application initialization.  Sets up the
        state for FlushGDIHeap.  */ 
     /* Make sure this version of Windows has the bug. */ 
     if (wWinVer >= 0x400)
             return;

     /* This is from MSDN and it gets GDI's DS.
      * The module handle return by LoadLibrary is actually the module's DS.
      */ 
     hGDISegment = LoadLibrary("GDI.EXE");
     if (hGDISegment <= HINSTANCE_ERROR)
             return;

     FreeLibrary(hGDISegment);

     Glob(segGDI) = HIWORD(GlobalLock(hGDISegment));

       Glob(hPalSys) = GetStockObject(DEFAULT_PALETTE);
       // Debug version of Windows has palette metafile list
       // heap handle in different offset than in retail Windows
