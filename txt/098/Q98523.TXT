error message after you upgrade to MS-DOS 6.0 or later:

RESOLUTION
==========

According to 5th Generation Technical Support, the Direct Access installation
must be upgraded to work correctly with MS-DOS 6.0 or later. This procedure
involves deleting all executable files (.EXEs) from the subdirectory containing
Direct Access files, clean booting with MS-DOS 6.0 or later, and then
reinstalling Direct Access by choosing the "Perform update from prior version of
Direct Access 5.1" option during the Direct Access Setup.

For more information on this procedure, call 5th Generation Technical Support.
