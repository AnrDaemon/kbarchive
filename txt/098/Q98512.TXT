======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run DoubleSpace on some plasma display screens, some highlighted
screens and some color combinations are not viewable. For example, when you
select a menu, you may be unable to see the selected command.

There is no way to directly change the default colors or the video display.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this problem by using Debug to edit DBLSPACE.EXE and change
the default colors.

NOTE: This procedure works for the DBLSPACE.EXE file provided with MS-DOS 6.0
(dated 3-10-93 with a size of 274484 bytes). It does not work with the
DBLSPACE.EXE file provided on the Conversion Disk for Users of Stacker.

1. Make a backup copy of your DBLSPACE.EXE file. To do this, type the following
   at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:

   " copy c:\dos\dblspace.exe c:\dos\dblspexe.sav " (without the quotation
   marks)

2. Rename DBLSPACE.EXE before running Debug. To do this, type the following at
   the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:

   " ren dblspace.exe dblspace.bw " (without the quotation marks)

3. Run Debug and edit the DBLSPACE.BW file. To do this, type the following at
   the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:

   " debug dblspace.bw " (without the quotation marks)

4. Follow the steps shown in the table below. Press ENTER after each command
   shown in the "Command to ENTER:" column.

   NOTE: Debug displays a segment address in place of the "xxxx" shown below. For
   example, if the segment address is 2C0E, Debug displays the following after
   you enter the first edit command:

   2C0E:0BA4 74.

   In the commands where this segment address is represented with a "Yxxx", use a
   segment address that is calculated as follows:

   Add 3 to the left digit shown in the segment address (represented by "xxxx")
   that appears after you enter the first edit command. For example, if "xxxx"
   is equal to 2C0E, use 5C0E for the segment address in all commands that
   specify "Yxxx".

5. Rename DBLSPACE.BW so that it can be used. To do this, type the following at
   the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:

   " ren dblspace.bw dblspace.exe " (without the quotation marks)

Patch Locations in DBLSPACE.EXE
-------------------------------

The following are patch locations that are changed using the above Debug script.
If you prefer, you can use a hex editor to make these changes.

            Original    New
OFFSET:    Value       Value

00000AA4:    74         90    ; force monochrome colors
00000AA5:    07         90    ; force monochrome colors
00039F97:    07         00    ; change menu highlight
00039F98:    00         07    ; change menu highlight
00039FA7:    00         07    ; change list box color for options
00039FA8:    07         00    ; change list box color for options
00039FB7:    00         07    ; change hot key highlight when selected
00039FB8:    07         00    ; change hot key highlight when selected

Other Options
-------------

You can also work around this problem by using the command-line interface or by
pressing the PRINT SCREEN key to view the DoubleSpace screens. Although the
screens don't display with viewable colors, they do print correctly.
