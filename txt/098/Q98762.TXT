 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Page 74 of the "User's Guide" incorrectly instructs you to place the VSafe
Manager icon in the Windows 3.1 Startup group. For best results, VSafe Manager
should be loaded from the Load= statement in the [windows] section of the
WIN.INI file as follows:

   load=mwavtsr.exe

NOTE: Do not add a second load= line; add MWAVTSR.EXE to the existing load= line,
along with any other programs also being loaded. It is preferable to have
MWAVTSR.EXE listed first on this line.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 6.20
