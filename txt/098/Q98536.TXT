TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Network Connection Broken in Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Choosing to work offline in version 1.0 or 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for
Windows also forces versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks to
work offline.

When you send mail messages to other users, the mail message remains in the
Outbox and is not sent. Mail also displays a broken network connection icon in
the lower-right corner of the mail screen.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you select Work Offline from the File menu in Schedule+
and if your Mail message file (MMF) is stored locally.

RESOLUTION
==========

 - Move the .MMF file to the server. Schedule+ detects whether or not a user's
   .MMF file is on the server or stored locally. If the file is stored on the
   server, Mail will not be allowed to work offline.

 - Work offline only when necessary. From the File menu, choose Work Online.
   This forces any changes made in the local calendar file to be uploaded to the
   server, thus forcing Mail to work online.
