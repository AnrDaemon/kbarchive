The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) for HyperCard, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Network, the Out of the
Office (OOF) message Hypercard stack sends only one OOF message per user from
whom mail is received.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OOF stack keeps a table of users it has returned OOF messages to. Additional
messages received from those users are not responded to.

The table containing this information is cleared each time the OOF stack is
restarted.

In addition, the OOF stack does not send a message to another OOF stack running
because this would create an endless loop of messages.


Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
