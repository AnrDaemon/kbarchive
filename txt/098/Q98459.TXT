SUMMARY
=======

When you use DoubleSpace, you should back up the files on your compressed
volume, not the compressed volume file (CVF) on the host drive. For example, if
you have compressed drive C and DoubleSpace has created the host drive as drive
H, you should back up all your files on drive C and any data files left on drive
H. You do not need to back up any DBLSPACE.<nnn> files (for example,
DBLSPACE.000) on the host drive.

This allows you to restore single files from drive C if necessary. If you back up
only the DBLSPACE.<nnn> file(s) you can restore only an entire drive. This
could be a problem because all changes to all files (on the compressed drive)
since the last backup are overwritten when you restore the DBLSPACE.<nnn>
file.

For more information on DoubleSpace terminology, run DoubleSpace, choose Contents
from the Help menu, and then select Understanding DoubleSpace Terms.

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.


Additional query words: 6.00 6.20 double space
