TITLE   :DoubleSpace Err Msg: ...Crosslink Between Files C: and C:
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

DoubleSpace displays the following error message:

   DoubleSpace found Crosslink between files C: and C:

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when your system has cross-linked files.

The reason drive letters are displayed rather than filenames and the two "files"
shown are the same is because there are cross-linked entries in the MDFAT.
Because these entries (or clusters) are marked as allocated in the MDFAT but
free in the FAT, they are not considered to be parts of any file or files.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct the cross-linked entries in the MDFAT, run CHKDSK /F. If CHKDSK does
not correct the problem, either obtain MS-DOS 6.22 or later and run MS- DOS
ScanDisk on the DoubleSpace-compressed drive, or obtain a third- party
DoubleSpace-aware surface scan program.

For more information about MDFAT, query on the following words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   "mdfat" (without the quotation marks) and "doublespace" (without the
   quotation marks)
