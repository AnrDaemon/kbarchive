TITLE   :Replacing a Corrupted NET.ACC with Its Backup

SUMMARY
=======

There is no utility that can fix a corrupted NET.ACC file, but you can replace a
corrupted one with its uncorrupted backup copy.

Note: DON'T copy a NET.ACC file directly from a backup primary domain controller
(PDC) to the primary; it can cause problems. Instead, follow this procedure:

1. Change the primary PDC role to backup.

2. Promote a backup PDC to primary.

3. Bring the PDCs back up.

The NET.ACC is copied from the new primary to the new backup, making a NET.ACC
with all your accounts intact. You can then swap PDC roles again and be back in
business.
