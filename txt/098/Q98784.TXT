TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Cannot Choose All When Exporting to a Text File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to export information from Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows to a
text file, the All option button is not available. Similarly, when you attempt
to export Schedule+ information in the Schedule+ file format, the only option
available is All.

CAUSE
=====

When you export a file as ASCII text, Schedule+ only allows you to export either
all information, in the case of the Schedule+ file format, or information from
one date to another.

The Schedule+ Help file incorrectly implies that you can export any file format
to a file using either the All or the From option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 1.0 and 1.0a of
Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: schedule plus 1.00 1.00a
