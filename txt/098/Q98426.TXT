TITLE   :Full Sync on LAN Manager 2.1a/2.2 Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

To initiate a "full sync" of the Netlogon service on all of the backup and
member servers under LAN Manager 2.1a or 2.2, the old trick of adding then
deleting a user no longer works.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here is how to accomplish a full sync on the PDC:

1. Stop the server.

2. Change a user (fullname, comment, something trivial).

3. Delete (or rename) $(lanroot)\ACCOUNTS\UASCHG.LOG.

4. Start Netlogon.

When the primary comes back up, it broadcasts a new serial number that is at
least one higher than that of all the other servers. The other servers ask for
the changes, and the primary responds with a NERR_SyncRequired because it has no
record of that one change.

Additional query words: 2.10a 2.1a 2.20 2.2
