TITLE   :DOCERR: Correction to MM Viewer DW_SIZE Message Parameters
PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Software Development Kits
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer Publishing Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The lParam1 and lParam2 parameters for the DW_SIZE message are documented
incorrectly in the Microsoft Multimedia Viewer version 2.0 "Technical
Reference." The LOWORD of lParam1 has the width of the main window, and the
HIWORD of lParam1 has the height of the main window. lParam2 is always 0
(zero). The correct documentation for lParam1 matches the documentation for
the lParam of the Windows WM_SIZE message, which is documented in the
Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) "Programmer's Reference,
Volume 3: Messages, Structures, and Macros" for version 3.1, page 194.

Additional query words: 2.00 LDLLHandler DC_MINMAX docerr
