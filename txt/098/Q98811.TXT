The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to AT T, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail Gateway to AT&T EasyLink may display the following error
message on the screen or in the ATTGATE.LOG file once the SMTPGATE.EXE is
executed:

   Err=-101 Function=FFAPI_RunGet FFAPI Run-Time Error. Error=20
   Process=C:\ATTGATE\SMTPGET.EXE

This error message indicates there was a problem trying to spawn SMTPGET.EXE--the
File Format API (FFAPI)-based executable that pulls mail queued up for EasyLink,
from the MS Mail postoffice. The Error=20 is a FFAPI error, meaning there is
insufficient memory for it to run.

The AT&T Gateway requires at least 470K of free conventional memory. The
amount of conventional memory determines the number of recipients supported in a
single message, and it can be determined by using the MS-DOS MEM command:

   c:>mem

For example, after all the required network drivers are loaded and there is 515K
free conventional memory, the gateway supports approximately 350 recipients in a
message passing through the gateway.

NOTE: Each additional kilobyte supports approximately 15 more recipients. The
size of the message body or attachment(s) is not limited by the amount of
conventional memory.
