SUMMARY
=======

Windows Sound System Autodemo is an MS-DOS-based application that displays the
main features of Windows Sound System through the use of graphics and sound. It
uses the PC speaker available on most PC systems for sound output. The
demonstration can be ordered by calling Microsoft Sales Information Center
(MSIC) at (800) 426-9400 and requesting Windows Sound System Autodemo.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Autodemo runs from MS-DOS as well as from an MS-DOS box under Windows
running in 386 enhanced mode; however, the quality of the sounds played through
out the demonstration may be better when run from MS-DOS. To set up Autodemo,
insert the floppy disk into your floppy disk drive and run the Install program
by typing

   a:\install

at the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing ENTER. You can also install Autodemo
from Windows. From the File menu of Program Manager, choose Run and type:

   a:\setup.exe

Follow the steps on the screen.

To run Autodemo at the MS-DOS command prompt, type

   demo

from the directory in which you installed it (WSSDEMO by default). The
demonstration works better when run from the MS-DOS command prompt and with at
least 420K of conventional memory. You cannot adjust the volume on the sounds.
