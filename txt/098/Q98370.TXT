SUMMARY
=======

When you start Microsoft Golf for Windows, you may receive the following error
message:

   Microsoft Golf requires a minimum of 16 color graphics

This message will occur if the video display driver for Microsoft Windows is not
VGA or better.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The packaging for Microsoft Golf for Windows states that Microsoft Golf requires
a VGA or higher resolution monitor (color and SuperVGA are recommended). The
packaging neglects to say that Microsoft Golf requires a "Color" VGA resolution
monitor.

If you have a color VGA or higher-resolution monitor, you can change the current
display driver to VGA or a higher resolution display driver. To change your
display driver for Windows:

1. Open Windows Setup (usually found in the Main group).

2. From the Options menu, click Change System Settings.

3. Select VGA or another color display driver that is appropriate for your video
   card.

If you choose VGA, click Current and click Restart Windows when prompted. If you
select another display driver, follow the instructions that appear on your
screen.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Golf version 1.0.
