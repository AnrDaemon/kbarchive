TITLE   :Heuristics Don't Disable MS-DOS Workstation Write-Behind
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

There is no effective way to disable MS-DOS workstation write-behind using
heuristics.

 - Heuristic 0 sets the write-through bit on write SMBs telling the server not
   to return until the data is written, but does not disable the redir
   write-behind.

 - Heuristic 1 applies only to write&X when X is submitted by the user
   application (as in CLOSE).

 - Heuristic 4 does not, as documented, apply to writes: only to READs.

 - Heuristic 10 applies only to FLUSH--COMMIT: not writes.

New heuristic (16) in LAN Manager 2.1a allows you to disable write-behind, but
only on files opened in compatible mode, not in deny-none mode.

Additional query words: 2.10 2.1 2.10a 2.1a 2.20 2.2
