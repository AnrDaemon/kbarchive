SUMMARY
=======

Symptoms of some problems may have hardware origins even though they do not
indicate them: for instance, you cannot get NET LOGON or NET VIEW to function,
but can do NET USES and directed NET VIEWS to a server. This article may help
you locate the source of these types of problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The easiest way to eliminate hardware as the source of a NET LOGON problem is to
run the loop back driver (available only in OS/2). If NET LOGON functions
correctly after you load this driver, then you have a hardware problem. If NET
LOGON continues to fail, you have a configuration problem.

If after re-establishing the old protocols you are able to run a directed NET
VIEW command (for example, NET VIEW \\server\share) but not a general broadcast
based NET VIEW of all the available servers in your domain, then the problem is
caused by one of the following:

 - You have an interrupt conflict.

   Occasionally an interrupt conflict can cause a problem that affects broadcasts
   (NET LOGON or NET VIEWS) but not session based functions (NET USES).

 - You have a cabling problem.

   Somewhat less often, the issues can be traced to faulty cabling either between
   the given workstation and the port (in the case of twisted pair and type 1
   token ring) or at the next T connection (with coaxial cable).
