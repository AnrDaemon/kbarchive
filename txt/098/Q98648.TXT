TITLE   :Error on Incorrect Line After SHELL Statement in CONFIG.SYS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An error in the CONFIG.SYS file is reported on the wrong line number if the line
containing the error follows the SHELL statement. The error is reported on the
line after the one that actually contains the error.

For example, the message "Error in CONFIG.SYS line 5" would indicate an error on
line 4 if line 4 is located after the SHELL statement.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, position the SHELL line as the last line in your
CONFIG.SYS file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21,
and 6.22. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
