TITLE   :Using MS Undelete to Restore Files with Existing Filenames
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you restore a file with Microsoft Undelete for Windows and a file with that
name already exists, you receive a message stating "This file already exists."
If you type a new filename in lowercase letters, Microsoft Undelete for Windows
saves the file to disk with a lowercase filename.

Because lowercase names are invalid in the MS-DOS file allocation table (FAT)
system, many programs cannot access the lowercase-named file.

WORKAROUND
==========

You may be able to correct this problem using the DEL command and the wildcard
character (?). For example, if you want to delete "wina20.386", type "del
????20.386" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
press ENTER. Once you delete the file, run Undelete and restore the file again.

If this does not work, use a third-party program such as Norton Utilities by
Symantec or PC Tools by Central Point Software to change the filename to
uppercase letters.

Additional query words: 6.00 lower case upper lower-case upper-case
