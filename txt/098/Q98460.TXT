SUMMARY
=======

This article covers the use of MS-DOS 6.0 with SyQuest removable-media drives
and tape drives.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using MS-DOS 6.0 on SyQuest Removable-Media Drives
--------------------------------------------------

MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup returns an "Incompatible medium" error message when you
attempt to install onto a SYDOS removable-media drive.

SyQuest driver versions 2.61 and earlier are incompatible with MS-DOS 6.0.
SyQuest is aware of this problem and has provided an updated driver contained in
the self-extracting file DRIVER.EXE. The latest version of the driver is 2.74,
which is compatible with MS-DOS 6.0.

To obtain DRIVER.EXE, call SyQuest or download it from the SyQuest bulletin board
service (BBS).

SyQuest recommends loading this driver first in the CONFIG.SYS file. It should
always be loaded before the DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.SYS /MOVE line.

NOTE: SyQuest recommends that you do not use any disk caches (including
SMARTDrive) with SyQuest disk drives because they do not provide proper support
for caching.

Using SyQuest Tape Drives with MS-DOS 6
---------------------------------------

According to SyQuest Technical Support, the SyQuest tape drive device driver
SQ55.SYS dated July 1990 is incompatible with MS-DOS 6.0.

To work around this problem, obtain an updated device driver from SyQuest.
SyQuest removable tape drives require the SQ55.SYS device driver.
