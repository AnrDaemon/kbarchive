TITLE   :Recover from 20CLEAN.CMD when Upgrading from LAN Man 2.1
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

When upgrading from LAN Manager 2.1 to LAN Manager 2.1a or LAN Manager 2.2, DO
NOT run the 20CLEAN.CMD program. The Read Me First instructions in the LAN
Manager 2.1a package are incorrect: step 4 applies only if you are upgrading
from 2.0 to 2.1a. If you do run 20CLEAN.CMD, this error results when the attempt
is made to detach LAN Manager:

   Error in SETUP.INF

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 20CLEAN.CMD file copies newer versions of the following files to your LAN
Manager root directory (C:\LANMAN by default):

   BACKACC.EXE
   SETUP.EXE
   ACLAPI.DLL

If you have already run 20CLEAN.CMD, you need to get your LAN Manager 2.1 OS/2
Setup disk and copy the file A:\SETUP.EXE to your c:\<lanroot> directory
(C:\LANMAN by default). This will allow you to run Setup from your lanroot and
detach the LAN Manager installation. After this step, you must continue with the
rest of the upgrade instructions.
