-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows 
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SB_ENDSCROLL scroll bar notification code, which indicates that the
user has released the mouse button after scrolling, is missing from the
documentation for the CWnd::OnHScroll() function. One use of the
SB_ENDSCROLL message defers time-consuming drawing until the user stops
scrolling.

The SB_ENDSCROLL code is included in the documentation for the
CWnd::OnVScroll() function and in the WM_HSCROLL message documentation in
the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) "Programmer's Reference, Volume
3: Messages, Structures, and Macros" manual. The scroll bar notification
codes are also listed in the Windows header file WINDOWS.H and in the
Windows NT header file WINUSER.H.

The documentation has been corrected in later versions.
