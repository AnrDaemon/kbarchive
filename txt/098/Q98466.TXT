-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1993 edition 
 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer, versions 1.0, 2.0 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0a, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you access Bookshelf 1993 from Word for Windows, the following error
message may appear:

   WordBASIC Err=5: Illegal Function Call

NOTE: This problem does not exist with Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

The WordBASIC Err=5 error occurs because the macro that runs Microsoft Bookshelf
and its components from Word either cannot find the BOOKSHLF.DLL file or it
finds an outdated version of BOOKSHLF.DLL.

WORKAROUND
==========

NOTE: The following steps assume that your CD-ROM drive is drive D and Windows
is installed in the C:\WINDOWS directory.

To work around this problem, do the following:

1. Make sure C:\WINDOWS is in the path in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

2. Search for earlier versions of the BOOKSHLF.DLL file. (BOOKSHLF.DLL is
   located in the VIEWER\BS93WORD subdirectory by default.) Compare the file
   dates and file size of the version(s) found with BOOKSHLF.DLL on the CD-ROM.
   Remove earlier BOOKSHLF.DLL files.

3. Copy BOOKSHLF.DLL from the CD-ROM to C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM.

4. Remove multiple or outdated copies of BOOKSHLF.DLL. There should be one copy
   in the C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory only.
