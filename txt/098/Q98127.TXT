   Template format.

   -or-

 - that is in a format other than Word Document Template format, such as a Word
   document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Word, you usually create a new document by basing it on a template. However,
you can also base a new document on another Word document, but you cannot later
attach a Word document as a template to an existing Word document.

When you base a new document on an existing Word document, Word inserts the text
from the existing document in the new document as a boilerplate.
