======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

A logshow report includes the error

   DISK01 FFAA date time - Ctrl/drive failed to generate an interrupt

CAUSE
=====

This represents an RCB timeout, indicating that the system sent an I/O to the
card but received no interrupt notifying it that the I/O completed. Usually this
error occurs if the disk does not respond to the adapter or the adapter
encounters a firmware problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the error does not occur frequently, it's nothing to be concerned about. If
it does occur frequently, your system performance can be affected, in which case
you may want to consider replacing the disk and controller.
