The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0b

SUMMARY
=======

In Flight Simulator 4.0, if the altimeter increases past 128,000 feet, it will
jump back to zero. This is a result of binary overflow in the display. When
descending back through 128,000 feet, the altimeter will again be accurate. The
aircraft performance is not affected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This limitation does not occur in Flight Simulator 5.0.
