TITLE   :SAMPLE: VIEW Demonstrates Drawing Ink at a Slower Rate
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The View.exe sample is a Windows for Pen Computing sample that demonstrates how
to:

 - Display ink via RedisplayPenData()

 - Display the "best guess" in text from the Recognizer

 - Use TrueType fonts to mimic the same height of the raw ink text

 - Display how to parse through the individual ink data points and do a "slow
   draw" of the ink, much like the Trainer application does.

MORE INFORMATION

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:

View.exe allows developers to experience how ink display is done, and provides
one conversion algorithm that can be used to convert the raw ink into recognized
values [see SYV, SYG, SYE, and SYC in the Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing
"Programmer's Reference" in the Windows version 3.1 Software Development Kit
(SDK) for more information on recognition results.]

These values can then be converted and displayed as text on a device context (DC)
in a TrueType font such that a close approximation of the raw ink string height
can be mimicked by the font string itself.

Finally, the View.exe sample demonstrates through the use of a timer callback
function, how to walk through the individual stroke points and draw them one by
one. With a timer running, it is possible to slow down the speed at which the
ink is redrawn, and thus to see approximately how the ink was drawn by the
user.

This is similar to how the Trainer application (available in the Windows for Pen
Computing environment) does its slow drawing to demonstrate inking techniques.

View.exe was built and tested under Microsoft Windows version 3.1. The program
requires Penwin.dll, which can be found in both Microsoft Windows for Pen
Computing and the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 SDK. View also requires the
TrueType Arial font.
