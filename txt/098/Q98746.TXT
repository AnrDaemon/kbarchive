TITLE   :PRB: SET DEVICE TO PRINTER PROMPT Does Not Open Dialog Box
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::2.5x,2.6x,3.0,6.0,7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 6.0, 7.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing the SET PRINTER ON PROMPT or SET DEVICE TO PRINTER PROMPT command
immediately after issuing the same command does not produce the expected
Microsoft Windows Print dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

Once the printer has been defined, FoxPro does not display the Print dialog box
again until the printer is once again in an undefined state. For example, this
problem will occur if the previous print job has not yet been released by Print
Manager or the network spooler.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Add the command SET PRINTER TO to the end of your program so the print job
   will be released each time the program is run and consequently, the Print
   dialog box will appear every time.

   -or-

 - Use the following code sequence after the print job is completed:

      SET PRINTER OFF        && disables output to the printer.
      SET PRINTER TO         && resets output to default MS-DOS PRN print
                             && utility

   NOTE: The SET PRINTER TO command causes a page to be ejected from the printer.
   A workaround to this behavior is not known at this time.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce the problem, run the following program twice:

      SET DEVICE TO PRINTER PROMPT
      @ 3,3 SAY 'HELLO,WORLD'
      SET DEVICE TO SCREEN

The first time the program is run, the Print dialog box will appear as expected.
The second time the program is run, the dialog box will not appear although both
print jobs are in the print queue.

NOTE: Both jobs will print if you quit FoxPro for Windows or if you issue the SET
PRINTER TO command in the Command window. Also, if the Cancel button on the
prompt is selected, FoxPro ignores this action and sends the @...SAY commands to
the printer anyway.
