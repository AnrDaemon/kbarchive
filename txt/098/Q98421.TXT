SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the significance of renaming a new bid for a boot drive to
spare001.sys or bootbid.bid.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are booting your system, your machine designates the first disk it
finds as boot disk. If you have two SCSI controllers, laddr boots from the one
it finds first by default. If you want to boot from the other one, rename it
boot.bid so that ddr will find it first from then on.

SPARE001.SYS was set up because any bid that is not registered in IOCFG01.SYS is
not tried as the laddr drivers are loaded. If you rename any new bid that comes
out to SPARE001.SYS, it will be tried as well. The other option is to include a
"device = " line in CONFIG.SYS.
