======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

At times you may receive the error message:

   General Failure Error Reading Drive O: Abort, Retry, Fail ?

The error occurs when trying to do a NET USE, and will occur from the MS-DOS
command prompt.

CAUSE
=====

This problem very often is caused by having a server-level that does not support
the amount of users you are trying to attach to the specified server. For
example, if you have a ten user server, and you try to attach an eleventh user,
you will sometimes encounter the error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add a user pack so that your server-level allows the amount of sessions you are
trying to support.

Additional query words: 2.10 addpack
