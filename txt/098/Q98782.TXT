TITLE   :Mac Wkst: Message Summary Screen Not Displayed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, the Message Summary
screen may disappear so that only the menu bar displays. This problem may occur
after you click the zoom box or after you launch Mail.

CAUSE
=====

The local data file contains the screen coordinates for the Message Summary
screen's location. With version 3.1 of Mail, it is possible for these
coordinates to give a reference point that is outside the current monitor's
visible screen. Consequently, the summary screen cannot be viewed and only the
menu bar remains.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, either remove or rebuild the user's local data file.
Either action should force the summary screen to reappear in the default
location the next time Mail is launched.

Additionally, you should upgrade to version 3.1a of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk
Networks. Mail 3.1a ensures that the reference points lie within the current
monitor's visible screen.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail
for AppleTalk Networks. This problem was corrected in version 3.1a.
