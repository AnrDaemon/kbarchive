-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

The Zenith Data System Z-Note portable computer Windows for Workgroups device
driver, I82593.DOS, does not work correctly with MS-DOS 6.x if it is loaded in
upper memory.

The following problems may occur if you load I82593.DOS high:

 - You may receive a critical error from Novell NetWare. (Your system may stop
   responding [hang].)

 - Your system may return to the MS-DOS command prompt when you try to start
   Windows.

 - Your computer may reboot spontaneously.

 - Your computer may hang.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add "*I82593" (without the quotation marks) to the
MEMMAKER.INF file and then run MemMaker. This prevents MemMaker from loading
I82593.DOS high.
