MORE INFORMATION
================

Some CD-ROM drives are not capable of playing CD audio due to the SCSI
controller. This can be verified by starting Media Player and choosing CD Audio
from the Device menu. The following error message will result if the CD-ROM
drive is not capable of playing CD Audio:

   There is an undetectable problem in loading the specified device driver.

Any music CD in the drive will produce the above error message in Media Player.

Although you cannot play the tracks from the Beethoven CD-ROM, Setup for
Beethoven usually runs to completion without problems.
