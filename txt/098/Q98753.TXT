TITLE   :ERR: "Feature Not Available"; MODIFY/CREATE QUERY in .EXE File

KEYWORDS:kbcode kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MODIFY QUERY and CREATE QUERY commands return "Feature not available" error
messages when called from an executable file built with the FoxPro Distribution
Kit.

CAUSE
=====

The MODIFY QUERY and CREATE QUERY commands are intended only for use in the
interactive development environment of FoxPro. End users must possess the full
product in order to access these commands.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this limitation, use the RQBE window to construct a SELECT- SQL
statement, then copy the results from the See SQL window and paste them into a
.PRG file. Using this method, you can also create a RQBE-like screen/window that
contains variables that can be used in the SELECT-SQL statement.

The following sample code demonstrates this workaround:


      dbfname = space(12)
      value = space(12)
      fieldname = space(12)

      @ 5,5 SAY "Enter the database name: " GET dbfname
      @ 7,5 SAY "Enter the fieldname: " GET fieldname
      @ 9,5 SAY "Enter the value: " GET value
      READ

      fieldname = ALLTRIM(fieldname)
      dbfname = ALLTRIM(dbfname)
      value = ALLTRIM(value)

      SELECT &fieldname from &dbfname ; && Macro expansion is OK here.
        WHERE &fieldname = (value) ; && Parentheses ARE required here.
        INTO cursor query
      BROWSE
