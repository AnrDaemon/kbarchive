following files are truncated:

   CHKSTATE.SYS
   EMM386.EXE
   HIMEM.SYS
   MEMMAKER.HLP
   MEMMAKER.EXE
   SIZER.EXE

These files may be truncated to 8192, 4096 or zero bytes.

In addition, you may receive one of the following errors:

 - "Sector not found" error message overlaying the blue MemMaker screen

   -or-

 - "Bad or missing error in CONFIG.SYS line n" error message

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS MemMaker version 6.00.
This problem was corrected in later versions.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

1. Set the path to PATH=C:\DOS.

2. Expand CHKSTATE.SY_, EMM386.EXE, HIMEM.SY_, MEMMAKER.HL_, MEMMAKER.EXE, and
   SIZER.EX_ from the original MS-DOS 6.0 disks. For example, to expand the
   CHKSTATE.SY_ file, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
   press ENTER:

   " C:\dos\expand a:\chkstate.sy_ c:\dos\chkstate.sys " (without the quotation
   marks)
