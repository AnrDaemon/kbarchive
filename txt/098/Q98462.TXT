SUMMARY
=======

These lines are in the [TCPIP_XIF] section of PROTOCOL.INI:

   LOAD=TCPTSR[C], TINYRFC[C], EMSBFP[C],TELNET[C], BAPI[CR]
   UNLOAD="UNLOADT /NOTSR[DC]"

Switch codes:

   U - On load: load into upper memory if possible
       on unload: unload from memory
   C - Do not load into upper memory
   B - Bind protocol to hardware
   R - Register protocol with redirector
   D - Deregister protocol with redirector

These switches are not specific to TCP/IP: they are valid for any demand loadable
protocol. The lines for other protocols are very similar to the ones shown
above.
