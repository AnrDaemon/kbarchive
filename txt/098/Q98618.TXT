SUMMARY
=======

Certain files on the Windows 3.1 disks that ship with the new "User's Guide" for
Windows 3.1 were modified to update references to the new "User's Guide" and
reword some phrases for better clarity. The files listed below contained
references to the older version of the "User's Guide" and "Getting Started"
manuals. These files were NOT changed substantially. (The changes do not affect
the performance of Windows 3.1 or its setup.)
