SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft C and in Microsoft C/C++, the goto statement and its corresponding
label must be part of the same function; no other restrictions apply. However,
because different compilers optimize for loops and allocate stack space for
automatic variables in various ways, using a goto statement to transfer
flow-of-control into the middle of a for loop is not portable and is considered
unsafe.

The most common use for the goto statement in structured programming involves
error handling. In these cases, the goto statement usually leads out of a deeply
nested for loop.
