SUMMARY
=======

Create a window that has the following characteristics:

 - a parent window that is a tiled window with both horizontal and vertical
   scroll bars.

 - a child window that is a title, one line long, across the top of the parent
   window, and is stationary (that is, it does not scroll off the screen when
   the tiled window is scrolled vertically).

Create two child windows:

 - the first child window should be one line.

 - the second child window should be the rest of the client area.

Then, perform all of the scrolling in the second child window.
