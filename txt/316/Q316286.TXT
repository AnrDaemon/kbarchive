TITLE   :APPC Print Jobs Use 6 LPI Even if Session Configured for 8 LPI
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhis2000 kbhis2000bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) print jobs default to a
setting of 6 lines per inch (LPI), even though the APPC print session is
configured to use a setting of 8 LPI.

NOTE: This behavior does not occur if the APPC print session is configured to use
a Printer Definition Table (PDT).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the APPC print provider (Ppd5250.dll) does not
honor the LPI setting configured in SNA Manager for APPC print sessions. The LPI
value is always overwritten with the default value of 6 LPI.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
