TITLE   :XCCC: "Have Server Reply with Specific Message"  Rule Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange500 kbExchange550

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2002 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Exchange Server cannot perform the "Have server reply with specific message"
Inbox rule if you change the mailbox that is indicated in the From box. This
issue occurs even if you are the rule creator and you have delegate rights to
the mailbox that is indicated in the From box.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because Inbox rules run in the security context of the
Exchange Server service account, which does not have the inherited rights of the
mailbox owner.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, configure either a mailbox agent or a client side
rule that prompts Outlook to reply with the specific message. The client side
rule runs in the context of the mailbox owner and completes successfully.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about client side rules, see Outlook Help and Outlook
documentation. For more information about mailbox agents, see the Microsoft
Platform Software Development Kit (SDK).
