TITLE   :IIS: Errmsg: This Server Was Already Configured...
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In some situations, you may not be able to install the Internet Information
Services (IIS) Lockdown Tool 2.1 on a server and the following option is
displayed in the Internet Information Services Lockdown Wizard:

   "undo previous configuration and restore metabase to original configuration"

When you attempt to apply the IIS Lockdown Tool, the wizard fails and it cannot
perform a successful uninstall nor can it remove the configuration. You also
receive the following error message:

   This Server Was Already Configured

   This server was already configured using the Internet Information Services
   Lockdown Wizard. To view the current settings, open the OBLT-Log.Log file in
   the <Windows>\system32\inetsrv directory.

   To restore the original settings, click Next. After these settings have been
   restored, run this wizard again.

NOTE: This is an expected behavior if you have previously installed the tool, but
not if you have never installed it.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because when you run the IIS Lockdown Tool 2.1, the
following events occurs during the installation that allow the tool to reverse
itself in the future:

 - The Oblt-rep.log file is created in the <Windows>\System32\Inetsrv
   folder. This file contains a summary of the installation process and it is
   generated after the installation.

 - The following two metabase backup files are created and placed in
   <Windows>\System32\Inetsrv\Metaback folder:

    - Oblt-once.md0

    - Oblt-mb.md0

RESOLUTION
==========

To allow the wizard to run disregarding any previous installations, locate the
following files and delete them (or move them to a different location):

 - Oblt-rep.log
 - Oblt-once.md0
 - Oblt-mb.md0

NOTE: This folder also houses any manually created backup files by default. You
should only delete or move the files that start with the following string:

   oblt

By deleting or moving these files, the wizard should be able to run successfully
thereby allowing changes to the metabase.
