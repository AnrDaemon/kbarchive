======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The user function in Snacfg.exe lists information about a user in the
configuration file. The syntax of the command is:

   snacfg #com.cfg user <domainname>\<username>

If you use this command with a user name (including the domain name) that is
longer than 20 characters, one of the following symptoms occurs:

 - Snacfg returns a "User not found" error message.

 - Snacfg returns information about an incorrect user. This symptom occurs if
   another user name that is exactly 20 characters long and matches the first 20
   characters of the requested user name exists in the configuration file.

CAUSE
=====

These symptoms occur because Snacfg truncates the username parameter after 20
characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in SNA Server 4.0 and Host
Integration Server 2000.
