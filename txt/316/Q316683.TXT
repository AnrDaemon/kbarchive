KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400nospFix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Programs that use cryptographic functions that are provided by Schannel.dll may
show a memory leak. A function that is typically used at the beginning of the
sequence might be the AcquireCredentialsHandle function. Programs that make many
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections rapidly may experience this leak. For
example, Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Service Pack 4 (SP4) experiences this leak.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is caused by the caching mechanism in Schannel.dll. Typically,
credentials are cached for a while in case a client wants to try a reconnection.
Reconnections are effectively a mini-SSL handshake, during which the client uses
the session keys from a previous session.

This behavior occurs when you access Exchange over IMAP4 SSL port 993. Using
IMAP4 port 143, which is not an SSL port, does not show the leak.
