TITLE   :Active Server Pages with ODBC Driver for DB2 Causes Creation of
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::4.0 SP3,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) enters a recursive loop and creates
more than 7,000 threads under the following circumstances:

 - A Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) program uses ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)
   and Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2 to retrieve data.

   -and-

 - The ASP page runs in Isolated or Pooled Out-of-Process mode on Microsoft
   Windows 2000.

   -or-

 - The ASP page runs in Out-of-Process mode on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service
   Pack 6a.

The first ASP request completes and returns a result to the client. However, when
the Web Application Manager (WAM) cleans up after the request, WAM enters a
recursive loop that ends only when the system runs out of resources or when the
CacheCreateThread function stops responding.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the ODBC Driver for DB2 incorrectly calls the
CoInitializeEx function on a newly created thread.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft recommends that you use the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 instead
of ODBC Driver for DB2.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
