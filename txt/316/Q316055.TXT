TITLE   :Password Synchronization from UNIX Does Not Work with Yppasswd
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a UNIX user tries to change their password on a UNIX platform that is
configured to use the UNIX NIS component for password validation, the user
cannot do so. This occurs when the user uses the "yppasswd" (without the
quotation marks) command. Under these conditions, the password is not replicated
to the Windows computer by using the Windows Services for UNIX 3.0 password
synchronization component.

CAUSE
=====

If the Windows Services for UNIX Password Authentication Module (PAM) is
installed on a UNIX NIS Master, the "yppasswd" (without the quotation marks)
command does not use the pam_sso infrastructure.

RESOLUTION
==========

To make password synchronization work in an NIS/NIS+ environment:

1. Link yppasswd to the passwd command.

2. On all the NIS UNIX clients (whether the "NIS Master" is a Windows Services
   for UNIX NIS Server or a UNIX NIS server), edit the Etc/Nsswitch.conf file
   and set it to use NIS / NIS+.

3. If the "user" is not present in the local /etc/password | shadow files, the
   passwd|yppasswd command that was run on the UNIX client (NIS client) computer
   changes the NIS password for the user on the NIS master database.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
