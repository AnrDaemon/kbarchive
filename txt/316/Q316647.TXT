TITLE   :PRB: Merge Module (.msm) Files Not Updated by VFP 7.0 SP1
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::7.0,7.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbAppSetup kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbvfp700

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 7.0, 7.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual FoxPro 7.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) ships with updated merge module files,
Vfp7runtime.msm and Vfpoledb.msm. These files facilitate the distribution of
your Visual FoxPro 7.0 applications. Under certain circumstances, the
installation of Visual FoxPro 7.0 SP1 may not update these merge modules.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the timestamp of a .msm file to be updated is later
than that of the file shipped with Visual FoxPro 7.0 SP1.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, delete any .msm files that were not successfully
updated and install Visual FoxPro SP1 again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Windows Installer SDK includes an .msm/.msi database editor named
Orca. You can use this table-editing tool to edit your .msm files.
Unfortunately, Orca changes the timestamp on existing .msm files even if no
changes are made.

Any .msm files installed by Visual FoxPro 7.0 which are edited with Orca may have
a file date later than that of the files included in Visual FoxPro 7.0 SP1.
(Other tools, of course, may also update the timestamp.) Because there is no
version stamping on the .msm files, Visual FoxPro 7.0 SP1 must use the datetime
stamp as a basis of comparison when updating these files. When Visual FoxPro 7.0
SP1 sees a later datetime stamp, it does not update the file.

The merge modules are installed by default in the C:\Program Files\Common
Files\Microsoft Shared\Merge Modules folder. The RTM files are dated 6/14/2001.
If you updated your installation with the Runtime Hotfix, the files will be
dated 7/5/2001. The SP1 versions of the files are dated 1/4/2002.
