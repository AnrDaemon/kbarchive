When you play Microsoft Asheron's Call on Microsoft Windows XP, you may receive
the following error message:

   Client has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the
   inconvenience.

If you click "click here", a dialog box is displayed with the following
information about the error:

where <ModName> is Decal.dll, Inject.dll, Decalnet.dll, or
fearghalfilters.dll.

If you are not running Microsoft Windows XP, the game may quit, but you do not
receive an error message.

CAUSE

This issue can occur when you use a third-party add-in module with Asheron's
Call. The add-in module interferes with the normal operation of the game.

manufacturer for an update.
