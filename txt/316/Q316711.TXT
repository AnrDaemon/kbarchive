TITLE   :BUG: Incorrect CONV_ID for WinCPICSetEvent/WinCPICExtractEvent
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0 SP1,4.0 SP2,4.0 SP3,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:sna4 kbsna400sp1 kbsna400sp2 kbsna400sp3 kbhis2000 kbhis2000bug kbsna400sp4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Common Programming Interface for Communications (CPI-C) application programming
interface (API) traces display an incorrect Conversation ID (CONV_ID) when
tracing the following CPI-C verbs:

 - WinCPICSetEvent
 - WinCPICExtractEvent

The following is an example of how a WinCPICSetEvent verb appears in a CPI-C API
trace:

   CPIC  WinCPICSetEvent request  - event 12345678
   CPIC  
   CPIC  Conversation ID = 000000AB

NOTE: This behavior does not affect the functionality of any CPI-C applications
that call the WinCPICSetEvent and WinCPICExtractEvent verbs.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the CPI-C DLL (Wcpic32.dll) writes an incorrect
conversation ID for the WinCPICSetEvent and WinCPICExtractEvent verbs to the
CPI-C API trace files when CPI-C API traces are enabled.

For example, a conversation ID of 11223344 (Intel byte-swapped format) is
incorrectly displayed in the trace file as 00000011. The correct format of the
traced conversation ID would be 44332211.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Host Integration Server 2000 and SNA Server traces are enabled when you run the
Trace Initiator program (Snatrace.exe). For more information about the Trace
Initiator program, refer to the Host Integration Server 2000 and SNA Server
Online Documentation.
