======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 7.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you play a .wav file that is stored in a general field by using an "@ say"
command, you may receive the following error message:

   OLE error code 0x80010105: The server threw an exception.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use a memo binary field instead of a general field.
Copy the sound to a temporary file, and then use the "set bell to" command to
play the sound. The following sample code demonstrates this method:

   * If the file already exists, you are not prompted to overwrite it.
   SET SAFETY OFF

   * The NOCPTRANS clause makes this a binary memo field.
   CREATE TABLE testsound (sound M NOCPTRANS)

   APPEND BLANK 
   APPEND MEMO sound FROM GETFILE("wav")

   * Copy the sound from the table to a file.
   COPY MEMO sound TO "temp.wav"
   SET BELL TO "temp.wav", 1
   ?? CHR(7)
   SET BELL TO

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Run the following code. When the dialog box appears, select a .wav file:

   SET SAFETY OFF

   CREATE TABLE testsound (sound G)

   APPEND BLANK
   APPEND GENERAL sound FROM GETFILE("wav")

   @1,1 SAY testsound.sound verb "play"

2. If you are running one of the listed operating systems, you receive the error
   message that is mentioned in the "Symptoms" section.
