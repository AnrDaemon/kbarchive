SUMMARY

Favorites give you the ability to go to Web pages you found interesting or
informative. You can rename, add, or remove your favorites. Thumbnails of the
pages are displayed on the favorites page as well, to provide easy
identification of the page.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view favorites, see the favorites list on the Start page, or view thumbnails
of them by pressing the favorites button (a star) on your keyboard.

To add a favorite, navigate to the Web page you want to add, click Page Options
on the toolbar, and then click add this page to my favorites. Either leave the
default name for this page or type your own label for your favorite's list in
the input box, and then click add to favorites.

To rename or delete a favorite, press the favorites button (a star) on your
keyboard, click rename or delete favorites. Scroll through the list to find the
favorite you want to change and click either rename or delete. If you click
rename, you are given an input box in which you can type a new name and than
click done.
