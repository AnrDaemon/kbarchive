 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a primary domain controller (PDC) that is running Internet
Information Server (IIS), the following error message may appear:

   Dr Watson
   Application: lsass.exe
   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005)
   Address:0x006b0072

Event Viewer may display the following error messages:

   Event id:100
   Source: w3svc
   "Server was unable to logon the Windows NT account "." due to the following
   error: Unknown username or bad password"

   Event id:100
   Source: w3svc
   "The security database contains an internal inconsistency"

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Windows NT user account that is configured for
Anonymous Logon for the WWW Service is invalid or does not have the right to log
on locally to the PDC.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, replace the user account that is configured for
Anonymous Logon in the WWW Service with a valid Windows NT account that has the
right to log on locally to the PDC:

1. Start the Internet Service Manager.

2. In the right pane of the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), expand Internet
   Information Server and then expand <server name>.

3. Right-click Default Web Site, and then click Properties.

4. Click Directory Security.

5. In the "Anonymous Access and Authentication Control" group, click Edit.

6. Click Edit next to "Account used for Anonymous Access".

7. Click Browse.

8. Select the account that you want to use for Anonymous Logon, click Add, and
   then click OK.

9. Click Enable Automatic Password Synchronization, and then click OK.

10. Click OK to close each open dialog box.

11. Quit MMC. When you are prompted to save the settings, click Yes.
