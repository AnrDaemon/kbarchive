The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you configure programs to run when you log on by using the Run registry key
or Startup group, the programs may not run.

CAUSE
=====

When you run a program, such as Microsoft Windows Media Player or Phone Dialer,
the Telephony service (Tapisrv.exe) is used. The Telephony service opens the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive and keeps the handle to this hive open for a
specific amount of time, even after you quit the program and log off. Therefore,
when you log off, the Winlogon.exe program cannot unload the current user
registry hive because there is an open handle to it through the Telephony
service.

RESOLUTION
==========
