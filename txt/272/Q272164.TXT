SUMMARY
=======

MSCEP.DLL is a Certificate Services add-on ISAPI dynamic-link library (DLL) that
enables enrollment for Cisco Systems, Inc., routers for IPSec authentication
certificates from a Microsoft Windows 2000 Certificate Authority (CA) using the
Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP).

The MSCEP add-on that is included with the Windows 2000 Resource Kits will stop
issuing certificates to the client after one successful enrollment. Subsequent
enrollments may return an integrity check error on the client.

After the Certificate Authority is restarted, the first enrollment will again
succeed, with subsequent requests failing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is corrected when you use the updated version of the Windows 2000
Certificate Services Add-on for SCEP (version 4.71.1015.0) which is available on
the Microsoft Windows Update Web site.

only applies to IRE Windows SCEP clients. This does not apply to Cisco IOS
routers.
