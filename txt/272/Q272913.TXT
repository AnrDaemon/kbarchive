TITLE   :CreateRemoteThread May Leak Handle in Windows NT Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP6
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The CreateRemoteThread() Application Programming Interface (API) may leak a
handle when the call is unsuccessful and returns a NULL handle. This increases
the handle count of the process that called the CreateRemoteThread() function.
Because the handle is NULL, the calling process cannot close the handle, and
this causes a memory leak.

NOTE: To detect the handle leak, use Performance Monitor and monitor the handle
count for the process that calls the CreateRemoteThread() API.

CAUSE
=====

The CreateRemoteThread function first successfully creates a thread where it
creates a thread handle. If the function is unsuccessful in the later stages of
processing, the created thread is terminated and the open handle to this thread
is not closed. This open handle causes a memory leak.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.
