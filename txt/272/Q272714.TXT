TITLE   :XFOR: Fax Sent to 1(262)xxx-xxxx Gets Addressed to 1Cxxx-xxxx

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a fax message to a 262 area code number and enclose the area code
parentheses, it arrives at the BISCOM Fax EDK gateway with the (262) changed to
an upper case C. This causes the fax message to be undeliverable.

CAUSE
=====

The use of parentheses in the address causes the change. The area code of this
fax address is incorrectly interpreted as an ASCII character. This behavior
occurs for any three digits enclosed in parentheses, where the first digit is a
0, 1, or 2.

Parentheses are used in an X.400 address to portray characters such as the at
sign (@), the exclamation mark (!), or the percent sign (%) in an address.

NOTE: When you start this version of the information store, the information store
databases are automatically upgraded to a new format. After the databases have
been upgraded, you can restore an earlier version of the Store.exe file on the
server, but only if it is version 5.5.2651.32 or later. If you restore a
Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2651.32 after the database has been
upgraded, you are no longer able to start the information store. For additional
