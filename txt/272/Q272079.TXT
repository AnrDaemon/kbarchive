TITLE   :IIS Search Method May Allow Unauthorized Users a  Directory List
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

It may be possible for an outside user to use the search functionality in Web
Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) to get a directory listing of a
Web site's content area.

NOTE: This is only a problem if Index Server is used on the server (which is not
enabled by default), and the directory lists can only be generated if the Web
site (or resource such as a virtual directory or file) has the Index property
set.

The implications of this are that an outside user may be able to discover a
hidden directory or an include file (such as a .inc). By using the search
feature, a use may be able to get a directory listing, which would make
discovery much easier. This may expose your Web site to a malicious attack (for
example, if a .inc file includes a database user name and password).

RESOLUTION
==========

To secure your Web site(s) from a possible attack, perform the following
checklist on your Web site(s):

 - If you are not using Index Server (for example, you don't have content on
   your Web site that you want to have searched), disable or uninstall the
   service.

   -OR-

 - In directories that contain sensitive information, make sure to disable the
   Index this resource option on the appropriate tab (for example, a virtual
   directory on the Virtual Directory tab).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 offers a new technology named WebDAV
(see RFC2518). Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) extends the
HTTP/1.1 protocol to allow clients to publish, lock, and manage resources on the
Web. Integrated into IIS, WebDAV allows clients to do the following:

 - Manipulate resources in a WebDAV publishing directory on your server. For
   example, with this feature, users with the correct permissions can copy and
   move files around in a WebDAV directory.

 - Modify properties associated with certain resources. For example, a user can
   write to and retrieve a file's property information.

 - Lock and unlock resources so that multiple users can read a file
   concurrently, but only one person at a time can modify the file.

 - Search the content and properties of files in a WebDAV directory.
