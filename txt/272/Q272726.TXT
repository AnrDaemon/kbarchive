TITLE   :XADM: Administrators Can Browse User List of Untrusted Domains
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

By design, administrators are able to access the user lists of non-trusted
Microsoft Windows NT domain controllers listed in the Primary Windows NT Account
section of the New Mailbox dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are an administrator, you can use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program to create a Null (anonymous) session to the primary domain controller of
the non-trusted domain. You then receive a user list and a list of trusted
domains for that domain.

To prevent anonymous users from receiving user list information, you must have
Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) installed. Earlier service packs of
Windows NT Server 4.0 do not include a mechanism to restrict anonymous users
from accessing user list information.
