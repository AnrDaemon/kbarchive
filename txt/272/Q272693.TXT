The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a DSN to connect to a database, you may receive an Active Server
Pages (ASP) 0x80004005 error message. This can occur when you have installed
Crystal Reports 8.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known issue that occurs when IIS or any other application creates and
attempts to use a System DSN after the installation of Crystal Reports 8. For
more information, see the following Crystal Decisions Knowledge Base article:

   http://support.crystaldecisions.net/library/kbase/articles/c2007581.asp
   (http://support.crystaldecisions.net/library/kbase/articles/c2007581.asp)

The Crystal Reports installation modifies the permissions for the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ODBC\odbc.ini registry key and its subkeys. The
Everyone group's permissions are changed from Special Access to Full Control.

When you create a new System DSN, it does not inherit the Windows NT default
permissions, or the new permissions created by the Crystal Reports 8
installation. Instead, the subkey for the new DSN receives permissions for two
user groups:

 - Local Machine\Administrators -- Full Control

   SYSTEM -- Full Control

Only the permissions for Administrators are set, and no permissions are set for
the Everyone group. Therefore, only users with Administrator rights can access
the System DSN.

RESOLUTION
==========

Download and run the fix from the following Web site:

   http://support.seagatesoftware.com/communityCS/FilesAndUpdates/scr8_webregfix.exe

MORE INFORMATION
================

Description of the Fix:

The Scr8_webregfix.exe update resets all existing permissions in the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ODBC\odbc.ini registry key (and all of its subkeys)
to the Windows NT default permissions. It also resets sections of the
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Interface and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Typelib subkeys to the Windows
NT default values. Any new and existing System ODBC DSNs now inherit the Windows
NT default permissions.

Version 8.0.0.84 requires that the Everyone group is set to Full Control and
cannot connect to a System DSN by using a Special Access (default) registry
permission level. The updated P2sodbc.dll file (version 8.0.0.85) is required to
connect to a System DSN by using the Windows NT default registry permissions.
(For example, the Everyone group is set to Special Access.)

NOTE: The P2sodbc.dll issue also applies when version 8.0.0.84 is distributed to
computers that do not have Crystal Reports installed (for example, as part of an
application previewing a Crystal Report). For more information, see the
following Crystal Decisions Knowledge Base article:

   http://support.crystaldecisions.net/library/kbase/articles/c2007612.asp
   (http://support.crystaldecisions.net/library/kbase/articles/c2007612.asp)

This fix also resolves the following SQL Server error messages if the System DSN
has been set after Crystal Reports was installed:

   Infinite logon to the database

   Error 20599 - Cannot open SQL Server

   Error 599

   Error - An error has occurred on the server in attempting to access datasource
