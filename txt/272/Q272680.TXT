   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNMP service may not start, or may stop responding (hang) on shutdown or
when you manually stop the service by using the Services tool or the net stop
snmp command. Also, you may receive the following error message:

   An application error has occurred and a application log is being generated.
   SNMP.EXE Exception: access violation(0xc0000005), Address: address

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you previously uninstalled the Systems Management
Server (SMS) version 1.2 client from your Windows NT Server-based computer. By
default, SMS 1.2 client Setup installs the Snmpelea.dll file, even if the SNMP
service is running on the server. Note that this does not occur with SMS 2.0.
When you uninstall the SMS 1.2 client, the Snmpelea.dll file and its associated
references in the registry are not removed, and this may cause problems with the
SNMP service that is still running on the server.


RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this problem, delete the Snmpelea.dll file after you uninstall the
client, and then delete its associated registry keys:

1. Delete the %systemroot%\system32\Snmpelea.dll file.

2. Delete the following registry keys, where <REG_SZ:> is the numerical
   listing of the extension agent:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SNMP_EVENTS

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNMP\Parameters\ExtensionAgents\<REG_SZ:>SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SNMP_EVENTS\EventLog

3. Restart the server. Note that if you do not restart the server, event ID 1105
   ("The SNMP service is ignoring extension agent key
   SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\SNMP_EVENTS\EVENTLOG because it is missing or
   misconfigured") is logged in Event Viewer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
