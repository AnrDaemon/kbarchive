SYMPTOMS

When you attempt to assign the return value of a function to an event procedure
array argument, an Application Error occurs if the function returns an array
that is not the same size as the array argument in the event procedure.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior:

 - a temporary array can be used as the return for the function and the array
   argument can be resized in the event procedure.

-or-

 - the array in the function can be re-dimensioned to the same size as the array
   in the event procedure.

STATUS
======
