TITLE   :SNA Server and NetBIOS ScopeIDs on Windows 2000 Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbsna

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

SNA Server and Host Integration Server are not compatible with NetBIOS ScopeIDs
on a Microsoft Windows 2000 Server. If a ScopeID is enabled, it is not possible
to add link services from SNA Server Manager or SNA Management Console. The user
interface does not respond for several minutes. It eventually recovers, although
the link service is not added.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the ScopeID is disabled, SNA Server works as expected. There are no known
problems with SNA Server and ScopeIDs in a computer that is running Microsoft
Windows NT. If ScopeIDs are required, there are two ways to work around this
problem:

 - Disable the ScopeID and add the link service, then re-enable the ScopeID.

 - Use the LINKCFG command-line utility to add the link service.
