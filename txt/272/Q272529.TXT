-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSN Companion, versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The MSN Companion is designed to remain on all the time. However, when it is not
in use, it can be "put to sleep."

When the MSN Companion unit is asleep, the unit will display a picture instead of
just a blank screen. This gives the unit the look of a framed picture instead of
a computer screen.

You may select the picture you want to display, or you may have no picture when
the machine is off.
