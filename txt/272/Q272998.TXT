TITLE   :XADM: Setup Doesn't Work with 0XC103FC93
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install an Exchange 2000 server into an existing Exchange Server
5.5 site, you may receive the following error message:

   ::ScFindLDAPPortNumberUsingDAPI
   (K:\admin\src\libs\exsetup\dapiaccess.cxx:682)
   Error code 0XC103FC93 (64659): Could not bind to the Microsoft Exchange
   Directory server <servername>

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Exchange Server 5.5 computer is not using or
does not have the correct Domain Name System (DNS) information.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either configure the Exchange Server 5.5 computer to use DNS, or configure HOSTS
files for the servers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to identify:

The error reports a bind issue; use LDP to bind to the Exchange Server 5.5
directory. Then, install Network Monitor and perform a trace of the bind to the
server. In this trace, you will see the endpoint=success (in the packet) and
bind=success; remote procedure call (RPC) bindback success or failure from
remote host is not seen.

This behavior is a result of a DNS issue, which explains why there is not a
bindback or bindback failure, because the request never made it from the server.
