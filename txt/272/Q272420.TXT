List Item text does not display in a ComboBox if a DoEvents statement is used

Any of the following actions can be used to work around this behavior:

 - The DoEvents statement can be placed after the statement that sets the
   ListIndex.

   Display Properties dialog.

   Private Sub Combo1_GotFocus()
      Combo1.ListIndex = 0
   End Sub

   Private Sub Combo2_GotFocus()
      DoEvents
      Combo2.ListIndex = 0
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()
      Command1.TabIndex = 0
      Combo1.TabIndex = 1
      Command2.TabIndex = 2
      Combo2.TabIndex = 3
      Combo1.AddItem "ABC"
      Combo2.AddItem "ABC"
   End Sub

6. Press the F5 key to run the program, and then click the drop-down arrow for
   ComboBox1.
