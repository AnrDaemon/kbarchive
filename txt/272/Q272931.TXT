PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe600 kbSSExplorer _IK kbGrpDSSSafe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Doing a "get" on a project label returns the wrong version of a file.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when a file level label interferes with the project level
label.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

 - Manually get files at correct versions from history dialog.

 - Find the incorrect version that is being returned and remove its file level
   label from the history window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a Visual SourceSafe database.

2. Create a Project called LabelTest.

3. Add a Text File called LabelTestFile.txt.

4. Check out the file, make any change to it, and then check it back in.

5. Label the root project "$/" INTEGRATION.

6. Check out the file, make any change to it, and then check it back in.

7. Label the file INTEGRATION.

8. Check out the file, make any change to it, and then check it back in.

9. Label the the project "$/Labeltest" INTEGRATION.

From this point, no matter where you do a get on the INTEGRATION label, you
always get the version that was labeled at the file level.
