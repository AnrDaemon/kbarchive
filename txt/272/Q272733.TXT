Blinking Mail Light

Each MSN Companion has a mail indicator light. If the unit is turned off and mail
comes in, the light blinks. The light stops blinking when you sign in, but
remains lit until you check your e-mail. If mail comes in while you are online,
the light will blink twice and remain on until you check your account.

Mailbox Features:

 - write mail - Opens a new e-mail message.

 - open address book - List of e-mail addresses of your contacts.

 - new mail - Mail you haven't read yet.

 - old mail - Mail you have read but haven't deleted.
