TITLE   :Unable to Add Workstation to Domain: 'A Domain Controller for Yo
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to add a workstation to a domain, you may not be able to do so,
and you may receive the following error message:

   A domain controller for your domain could not be contacted. You have been
   logged on using cached account information. Changes to your profile since you
   last logged on may not be available.

If caching is disabled, you may also receive this error message:

   The system cannot log you on now because the domain (DOMAIN_NAME) is not
   available.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the primary domain controller (PDC) has not
correctly registered the 1B (domain master browser) and 1C (domain controller)
NetBIOS names in the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS), or when the 1B and 1C
entries are not specified correctly in the LMHOSTS file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, register the 1B and 1C NetBIOS names in WINS again by
stopping and then restarting the Netlogon service on the PDC.

If your network does not use a WINS server and the domain controller is located
on a remote network segment, on the workstation, use an LMHOSTS file with the
correct 1B and 1C entries for the domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================
