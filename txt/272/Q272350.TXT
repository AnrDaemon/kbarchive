PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2000,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool w2000mscs kbClustering

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are attempting to remotely administer a Windows NT 4.0 Clustering
server by using the Windows 2000 Cluster Administrator tool, there is no option
available by which to set authorization permissions for cluster administration.

CAUSE
=====

The administration extension for the new Security tab is not registered on the
Windows NT 4.0 cluster.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable this functionality, execute the following command from a command
prompt of the Windows 2000 computer

   %SystemRoot%\cluster\cluster.exe -c:NT4ClusterName /regext:cluadmex.dll

where NT4ClusterName is the name of the cluster. For example:

   c:\winnt\cluster\cluster.exe -c:MYCLUSTER /regext:cluadmex.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Windows 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are using Windows NT 4.0 Cluster Administrator, permissions on Windows
NT 4.0 clusters are assigned by using the Permissions button on the General tab
of the cluster properties sheet. In Windows 2000 Cluster Administrator, this
functionality is located on the Security tab. When you are using the Windows
2000 Cluster Administrator to connect to a Windows NT 4.0 cluster, neither of
these methods are available until the Cluadmex.dll file has been successfully
registered on the Windows NT 4.0 cluster nodes. After successful registration,
the Security tab becomes available on all future Windows 2000 Cluster
Administrator remote connections.
