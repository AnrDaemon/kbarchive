TITLE   :XFOR: Could Not Load Some Objects Using Application Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Microsoft Exchange administrators use the Application Connector for Lotus
Notes, the following message may appear on client workstations accessing the
public folders into which the Notes folder data was replicated:

   Could not load some objects because they are not available on this machine.

This message appears when the controls associated with the form are not installed
on the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The forms work properly only on computers that have Application Connector
installed. For all other computers, the controls must be installed.

When the Application Connector installs, Mxocx2.exe installs in the Application
Converters folder. For the forms to work properly, share this file with the
intended Exchange folder users.

The Exchange folder may contain a message with a pointer to Mxocx2.exe and simple
instructions.
