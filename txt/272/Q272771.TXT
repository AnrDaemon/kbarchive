TITLE   :Clustering Doesn't Start If Cluster Files on Extended Partition
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcluster kbClustering

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows Clustering on a Windows NT 4 Server, Enterprise
Edition-based computer and place the cluster files in a logical volume on an
extended partition, the installation procedure may finish, but Windows
Clustering may not start.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the logical volume is the second or later volume on
the extended partition.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, repartition the hard disk in which you want to place
the cluster files so that it is a primary partition. You may want to do this
because there are very few situations where you must put the cluster files on an
extended partition.

If you need to place the cluster files in a logical volume on an extended
partition, you can use only the first logical volume on the extended partition
for the cluster files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install Windows Clustering by using the Cluster Wizard, you can select
the second or third logical volume on an extended partition. However, Windows
Clustering does not start. Additionally, the following events may be logged in
the System event log:
