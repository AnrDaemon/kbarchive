======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
 - ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro has the capability to handle Binary Large Object (BLOB) data from
providers like SQL Server by using ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) Stream objects and
recordsets.

A BLOB is a type of data column that contains binary data such as graphics,
sound, or compiled code. From the perspective of an application, this data is
"formless." In SQL Server, this data is commonly known as an "Image" data type.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code sample assumes that you have the necessary access and
privileges to a Microsoft SQL Server, and that you have the pub_info table in
the SQL Server 7.0 Pubs sample database.

1. In Visual FoxPro, create a new program.

2. Paste the following code into the new program:

   CLEAR
   CLEAR ALL
   RELEASE ALL
   #DEFINE LOC_SQLSERVERNAME	"MYSERVER"
   #DEFINE LOC_SQLUID		"SA"
   #DEFINE LOC_SQL_PWD	""

   LOCAL lcConnStr, lcSQL, loConnection, lcImageName, ;
   	loRecordSet, loADOStream

   lcConnStr="Provider=SQLOLEDB;" +;
   	"Data Source=" + LOC_SQLSERVERNAME + ";" +;
   	"Initial Catalog=PUBS;" +;
   	"UID=" + LOC_SQLUID + ";" +;
   	"Pwd=" + LOC_SQL_PWD

   lcSQL = "SELECT * FROM pub_info"

   *!* Creates the objects.
   loConnection = CREATEOBJECT("ADODB.Connection")
   loRecordSet = CREATEOBJECT("ADODB.Recordset")
   loADOStream = CREATEOBJECT("ADODB.Stream")

   *!* Open the connections.
   loConnection.OPEN(lcConnStr)
   loRecordSet.OPEN(lcSQL,loConnection,2,3)

   *!* Set Stream Object properties.
   loADOStream.TYPE = 1	&& 1=Binary Data, 2=Text Data.
   loADOStream.OPEN

   loADOStream.WRITE(loRecordSet.FIELDS("logo")) 	&& Pass data to the stream object.
   lcImageName = "BLOB.gif"                  		&& Sets the local file name.
   loADOStream.SaveToFile(lcImageName,2)         	&& Saves stream object to a file.
   @1,1 SAY CURDIR() + lcImageName BITMAP    		&& Displays image file

   *!* Close connections.
   loRecordSet.CLOSE
   loConnection.CLOSE
   loADOStream.CLOSE

   ERASE CURDIR() + "BLOB.gif"

3. Change the three #DEFINE statements to reflect your local setup, and then
   save and run the program.

4. Observe the image on the Visual FoxPro desktop.
