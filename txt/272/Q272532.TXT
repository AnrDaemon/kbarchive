-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a form that contains a DateTimePicker control is loaded, and you change the
date from today's date to "00", the date should revert to its original value
(today's date) because the date is invalid. However, on Windows 95, Windows 98
and Windows Millennium Edition (Me), the data that is contained in the value
property displays the last day of the previous month instead of the today's
date.

This behavior does not occur on Windows 2000 or Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, test the Day property, and set it to the original value
if an invalid date is entered as follows:

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, click Components, and then select the Windows Common
   Controls 2 check box. Click OK.

3. On the form, find an instance of the DateTimePicker control.

4. In the code module of Form1, paste the following code:

   Dim s As String

   Private Sub DTPicker1_Change()
       If DTPicker1.Day = 0 Then
           DTPicker1.Value = s
       Else
           s = DTPicker1.Value
       End If
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       s = DTPicker1.Value
   End Sub

5. Press the F5 key to run the project. You see today's date in the
   DateTimePicker text area.

6. Change the date to "0" (without the quotation marks) or "00" (without the
   quotation marks). The date reverts to today's date.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On a system that runs Window 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me, start a new
   project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, click Components, and then select the Windows Common
   Controls 2 check box. Click OK.

3. On the form, find an instance of the DateTimePicker control.

4. Press F5 to run the project, and you see today's date in the DateTimePicker
   text area.

5. Change the date to "0" (without the quotation marks). This value immediately
   changes to "00" as the control tries to verify the date. Then, the date in
   DateTimePicker changes to "0" instead of today's date.

6. If you examine the data that is contained in the value property, as
   demonstrated in the code below, the data displays the last day of the
   previous month.

   Private Sub Form_Click()
      MsgBox DTPicker1.Value
   End Sub
