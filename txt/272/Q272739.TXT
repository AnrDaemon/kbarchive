OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbVC600 kbVC600bug kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:

SYMPTOMS

You may receive the following error message when you compile a source file:

   error C2876: 'Base::fun' : not all overloads are accessible

Please refer to the sample code in the "More Information" section for details.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The compiler does not allow a private base class member name to be injected into
a derived class by a using declaration even though the derived class is declared
as a friend class of the base class.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following sample code demonstrates the bug:

   //test.cpp
   // compiler option needed: none
   class Derived;
   class Base
   {
   friend class Derived;
   void fun(void);
   };

   class Derived : public Base
   {
   protected:
   using Base::fun;
   };
