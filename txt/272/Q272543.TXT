SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses some limitations of the Network Segment object in the
Performance Monitor utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Unlike other objects, the Network Segment object does not start the collection
of counter values at system startup. You have to start the collection and
restrict its context to a process. The effects of the preceding behavior are
summarized in the following list:

 - If you call the network segment counters in a program, the collection must be
   started by calling the 1110 object, waiting for a short period of time, and
   then calling "1110" or "Global" to obtain network statistics.

 - The raw values of the network segment counters are collected by the Bhmon.dll
   tool (the Microsoft Windows NT version of Network Monitor) or the NmPerf.dll
   tool (the Microsoft Systems Management Server, SMS, version of Network
   Monitor).

   Both tools (providers) do not have a provision to accumulate data between
   runs. There is no preserved context and no service runs to accumulate data on
   a ongoing basis; unlike the network interface provider, which always runs and
   merely takes numbers from the Browser.dll tool.

   In a process, the counters are accumulative, but as the process is stopped,
   the counter values are lost. A program that runs in a different process can
   start the cycle if it first starts the collection process, and then reads a
   new set of counter values.

   The preceding behavior is by design.
