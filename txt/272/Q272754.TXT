SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to troubleshoot microphone-related problems when you
use one of the programs listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To troubleshoot microphone-related problems, use the following methods in the
order in which they are presented.

Reduce Background Noise
-----------------------

 - Reduce background noise, such as talking, children playing and doors
   slamming.

 - Use a high-quality microphone similar to the microphone that is included with
   the Deluxe version of the Microsoft Encarta Language Learning program.

Speak into the Microphone Properly
----------------------------------

Speak properly into the microphone and make sure that the microphone is
positioned correctly. Review the documentation that is included with your
microphone to verify the correct position for the microphone.

NOTE: The microphone that is included with Encarta Language Learning - French
Deluxe and Encarta Language Learning - Spanish Deluxe is designed to be
positioned slightly in front of and to the side of your mouth within 3/4 of an
inch.

The white dot on the microphone is to be positioned toward your mouth.

Verify That the Hardware Is Configured Correctly
------------------------------------------------

Verify that the microphone is firmly connected to the microphone jack (some sound
card jacks are marked with pictures) and not the headphone or the speaker jack.

If you cannot determine the correct jack, check the documentation that is
included with your hardware, or contact the hardware manufacturer. For
information about how to contact your hardware manufacturer, click the

3. Verify that the Volume slider that is directly below the Mic Balance or
   Microphone Balance slider is at the top and click to clear the Mute check box
   below the Volume slider.

4. Click OK, and then attempt to record a wave audio file again.

Test the Microphone by Using Microsoft Sound Recorder

   listen to your recording. If Sound Recorder works correctly, proceed to the
   next method.

Determine if the Sound Card and Driver Support Full-Duplex Audio
----------------------------------------------------------------

If only one person can talk at a time, or if sounds are distorted when two people
talk at the same time, your sound card may not be configured to support
full-duplex audio.

To determine whether your sound card and driver support full-duplex audio:

1. Run the Sound Recorder tool:

   Windows 95:

   Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to Multimedia, and
   then click Sound Recorder.

   Windows 98:

   Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to Entertainment,
   and then click Sound Recorder.

2. Repeat step 1 to start a second Sound Recorder session.

3. In the first Sound Recorder session, play a wave audio (.wav) file that is at
   least 30 seconds long:

   a. On the File menu, click Open.

   b. In the "Look in" box, browse to a wave audio file that is at least 30
      seconds long.

   c. Click the wave audio file, and then click Open.

4. While the first session of Sound Recorder is playing the wave audio file,
   switch to the second session of Sound Recorder, and then click Record (the
   red circle) to record a new wave audio file.

If you can record a new wave audio file while another wave audio file is playing,
your sound card supports full-duplex audio.

If you cannot record a wave audio file while another wave audio file is playing,
one of the following conditions is true:

 - Your sound card or the driver for your sound card does not support
   full-duplex audio.

 - Your sound card is not properly configured to support full-duplex audio.
