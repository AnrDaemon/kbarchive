TITLE   :SMS: Logon Server Manager Cannot Modify VB Scripts for Logon
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enable either Windows Networking Logon Client Installation or Windows
Networking Logon Discovery, and you then enable Modify User Logon Scripts
Systems Management Server (SMS) either at the top or at the bottom of the
existing script, the script modifications do not modify the logon script if the
logon script has a .vbs extension.

CAUSE
=====

Logon Server Manager (LSM) does not modify Visual Basic (VB) Scripts to call the
SMSLS batch file. Because of the complexities that are involved with VB Script
calls for additional processes, LSM records the following entry in the
Nt_logon.log file instead:

   Users with scripts that can't be changed are: <account name>

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, instead of specifying the VB Script directly as
the user logon script, create a small batch file that calls the VB Script. With
this method, you can use SMS Logon Server Manager to modify the user logon
script while still utilizing the advanced features of a VB Script.
