======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows Metafile (WMF) is created that contains a palette record, and
that WMF is playing into another WMF, a palette resource is leaked.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this bug, do not play a WMF that contains a palette into another
WMF. Instead, for example, play the WMF into a bitmap (DIB) and then put the
bitmap in the target WMF. Note that this method results in a loss of
scalability.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

To reproduce this bug, create a WMF with a SelectPalette call in it. Then play
that WMF into another WMF DC. A palette resource is leaked even if the WMFs are
deleted afterwards. The resource is regained when the application exits.
