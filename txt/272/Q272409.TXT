SUMMARY
=======

When you connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, using the MSN Companion, you
must have a Member ID and a password. This article describes the requirements
for a valid Member ID and password.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Member ID
---------

If you select a Member ID that is already in use, you are prompted for a
different Member ID. Select your Member ID carefully, because after it is
accepted, you are unable to change it. Your Member ID is also your e-mail
address.

Requirements for a valid Member ID:

 - Must be from 3 to 39 characters long.
 - May be alphanumeric, and may contain any combination of uppercase and
   lowercase letters and numbers.
 - Can include hyphen (-) or underscore (_) characters, but cannot contain
   spaces.
 - Must not contain offensive language, or be harassing.
 - Must not blatantly misrepresent MSN.

Password
--------

Your password, in conjunction with your Member ID, is required to log on to MSN.
It is important to keep your password secret to prevent others from using your
account.

Requirements for a valid password:

 - The password must be from 8 to 16 characters long.
 - The password may be alphanumeric, and may contain any combination of
   uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers.
 - The password can include hyphen (-) or underscore (_) characters, but cannot
   contain spaces.
 - The password must not be the same as your Member ID.

To make your password more secure:

 - Using a combination of letters and numbers.
 - Not using names, addresses, birth dates, social security numbers, phone
   numbers, or other things that someone could easily guess.
