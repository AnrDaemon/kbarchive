The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a high-resolution image or a complex drawing that yields a large
spool file, the EndPage function may fail and return -1, and the GetLastError
function may return 8 ("Not enough storage is available to process this
command").

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are an application developer and you are developing an application that
could be affected by this problem, consider rendering to a DIB section and then
using SetDIBitsToDevice/StretchDIBits to send the DIB data to the printer. This
method will help to reduce the size of the spool file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
