TITLE   :Cluster Admin Stops Responding When Renaming File Share Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2000,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:w2000mscs kbClustering

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you rename multiple-clustered resource share names using the Cluster.exe
tool from the command console, the following error message may be displayed:

   System error 87 has occurred.
   The parameter is incorrect.

Also, the Cluster Administrator may stop responding while it attempts to
enumerate the clustered resources.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the rename commands occur too rapidly; for example,
if they are executed in a script.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, use one of the following methods:

 - Rewrite the script to include an adequate pause between each rename command.

 - Rewrite the script to create new file share resources instead of renaming
   existing resource share names; then use another script to remove the unwanted
   share resources.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
