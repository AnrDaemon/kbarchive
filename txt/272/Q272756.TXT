SUMMARY
=======

Although applications that are written with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 can run
on Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, Visual FoxPro has not been tested and

Terminal Server Edition client session.

The system requirements for Visual FoxPro 6.0 and 7.0 are Microsoft Windows 95 or
later, or Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 (Service Pack 3 recommended,
Service Pack 4 preferred) or later. Visual FoxPro 6.0 and 7.0 are supported on
Windows 2000 Server with terminal services installed. The system requirements
for Visual FoxPro 5.0 are Windows 95 or later, or Windows NT Workstation 4.0 or
later.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition enables Windows NT Server to act as a
terminal server for multiple, simultaneous client sessions. Although you can
successfully install and run Visual FoxPro on a terminal client, the behavior of
Visual FoxPro is not guaranteed in this environment. Windows NT Server, Terminal
Server Edition is not an officially supported platform for the Visual FoxPro
product.
