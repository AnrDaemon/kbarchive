SUMMARY
=======

The Compaq cluster model S/100 uses existing technology and proprietary software
to implement Microsoft Cluster Server using Smart Array controllers and the
Compaq Recovery Server Option (RSO) switch. Standard installation procedures for
Microsoft Cluster Server do not apply to these configurations.

The cables to the arrays and slots for the controllers must be configured
properly according to the accompanying Compaq documents. Please contact Compaq
support and reference the S/100 Shared SCSI/RAID Storage - Compaq ProLiant
Storage System with Compaq Recovery Server Option. This article describes brief
installation steps and some suggested tuning enhancement based on experience
with the product, and some suggested changes by Compaq support. While this
article contains suggestions to avoid previously experienced issues, if you
implement the suggestions from this article while following the manufacturer
supplied installation steps and continue to experience problems, you may need to
contact Compaq support for further assistance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before installing the S/100 cluster, please check the following items to ensure
correctness:

 - Make sure the Recovery Server Option (RSO) firmware is suitable for
   clustering.

 - Check the computer's BIOS and ensure proper revision level for the server.

 - Make sure installed adapters are balanced between PCI buses according to the
   Compaq whitepaper on bus balancing. (This is not mandatory but may help
   performance under load.)

 - Check IRQ assignments. If you have the opportunity to assign separate
   interrupts to each installed adapter, do so. If the COM ports are not in use
   and the additional interrupts would help accomplish this configuration, then
   do so. Otherwise, if you must share interrupts, only share them with similar
   devices. Based on experience with this configuration, we suggest having disk
   controllers share interrupts and each network port have a separate interrupt.

 - Obtain current drivers for your network adapters. If using any Netflex-3 or
   "Compaq Netelligent TX 10/100" adapters that use the TLAN chipset, obtain the
   driver update noted in SP11377. You can also use a Compaq SSD version that
   contains this driver update or later revision. This update is not just for
   adapter teaming but helps avoid some possible issues with these adapters in
   some configurations.

 - Obtain the latest installation software for the S/100 from Compaq. The
   initial release was 1.0. There have been a few updates since then. You should
   use 1.01a or later update if available.

 - Read the release notes for the Compaq software version you are using. In the
   notes ther is a suggestion about putting each TCP/IP address resource in a
   separate resource monitor. While in some configurations this may increase
   performance, in others it may create excessive overhead by having many
   resource monitor processes. Previous issues have shown that placing the
   Compaq S/100 disk resources in their own resource monitor achieves similar
   goals and can prevent failover problems in some configurations. Make this
   change after installation of the complete cluster; or after installation of
   the first node.

 - Ensure array cables are attached according to the Compaq manual, and to array
   controllers located in the same slot number on each server. Beware of
   possible issues with dual ported controllers, as cabinets attached to dual
   ported controllers will both failover together, not independently.

 - Ensure matching firmware on controllers attached to the same array cabinet.
   Check firmware revisions on the controllers in the event that they are out of
   date.

The installation procedure for the S/100 consists of the following basic steps
that must be performed using the installation software provided by Compaq which
also prompts for the Windows NT Server 4.0 Enterprise Edition CD. For best
results, consult the Compaq S/100 Cluster manual as well. The basic steps to
install the S/100 cluster are:

1. Install Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition.

2. Install Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a.

3. Install the latest Software Support Diskette (SSD) from Compaq for the S/100
   hardware.

4. Choose drive letters for any attached arrays for cluster use. Make sure the
   same drive letters are available on the second node for these same devices.
   Do not allocate these drive letters to mapped network drives, CD-ROM drives,
   or other devices.

5. Install Compaq S/100 proprietary software.

6. Insert the correct disk when the S/100 installation prompts you for Windows
   NT 4.0, Enterprise Edition disk 2.

7. Choose disk resources to be managed by the cluster through the S/100 drivers.

8. When you restart the computer, the S/100 installation scans the resources.

9. Follow steps 1 through 5 on the second node to join the existing cluster.

NOTE: If you do not have the Compaq S/100 proprietary software, the shared arrays
may not be visible as choices and the cluster installation may not work
properly. Also, if you notice that the disk resources created are of type
"Physical Disk" then this may be an indication that the Compaq software has not
been used. Also, if using Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (or a later version), be
sure to reapply the service pack after installing the cluster software.
