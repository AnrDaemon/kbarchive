SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to list all available styles using the Formatting
toolbar.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the Style list on the Formatting toolbar lists the following
styles:

 - The built-in styles Heading 1-3, Normal, and Default Paragraph Font.

 - Any user-defined styles stored or in use in either the document or the
   template that the document is based upon.

To list all available styles, press and hold the SHIFT key and click the style
drop-down list on the Formatting toolbar.

If this action doesn't seem to work, make sure the insertion point or selection
is in the document text before you click the drop-down arrow.
