2. Create a program file called RemFrm.prg using the following code:

   PUBLIC ox
   ox=CREATEOBJECT('testset')
   ox.SHOW

   DEFINE CLASS testset AS FORMSET
      ADD OBJECT form1 AS test1 WITH ;
         TOP    = 0, ;
         LEFT   = 0, ;
         HEIGHT = 250, ;
         WIDTH  = 375
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS test1 AS FORM
      DOCREATE = .T.
      CAPTION = "Form1"
      NAME = "Form1"

      ADD OBJECT command1 AS COMMANDBUTTON WITH ;
         TOP = 200, ;
         LEFT = 56, ;
         HEIGHT = 25, ;
         WIDTH = 241, ;
         CAPTION = "Add Form", ;
         NAME = "Command1"

      PROCEDURE command1.CLICK
         THISFORM.HIDE
         THISFORMSET.ADDOBJECT("Form2","test2")
         THISFORM.ENABLED=.F.
         THISFORMSET.FORMS[2].ENABLED=.T.
         THISFORMSET.FORMS[2].SHOW
      ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS test2 AS FORM
      TOP = 33
      LEFT = 140
      DOCREATE = .T.
      CAPTION = "Form2"
      VISIBLE = .F.
      NAME = "FORM2"
      AUTOCENTER=.T.

   ADD OBJECT command1 AS COMMANDBUTTON WITH ;
      TOP = 192, ;
      LEFT = 48, ;
      HEIGHT = 25, ;
      WIDTH = 241, ;
      CAPTION = "Remove Me", ;
      NAME = "Command1"

      PROCEDURE command1.CLICK
         THISFORM.HIDE
         THISFORMSET.FORMS[1].ENABLED=.T.
         THISFORMSET.FORMS[1].SHOW
         THISFORMSET.REMOVEOBJECT(THISFORM.NAME)
      ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

3. From the command prompt, type the following:

   DO REMFRM

4. Click Add Form.
