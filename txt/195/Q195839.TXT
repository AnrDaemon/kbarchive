======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a NEC ODX-series PD Optical Disk Drive, Windows Explorer may
not automatically update the file and folder display if you swap a Phase-Change
Dual (PD) rewritable cartridge that has been formatted with the FAT file system
with another cartridge that has been formatted with the NTFS file system. Also,
when you click the Refresh command on the View menu in Windows Explorer, the
display may not be updated, and data written to the NTFS-formatted cartridge may
be damaged.

Note that this behavior occurs only if you install the NEC PD Optical Disk Drive
after you install Service Pack 4.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the drive's firmware. When you change cartridges, the
drive does not return valid sense data indicating that a new cartridge has been
inserted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the NEC ATAPI PD driver (Atapi.sys). You can
contact NEC Technical Support for an updated version of their ATAPI disk driver
at (800)-338-9549 or visit their Web site at:
