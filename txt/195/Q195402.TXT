======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

AS/400 print jobs that contain the Absolute Vertical Move SCS Command will print
with incorrect formatting if the AS/400 print session is configured to use a
Printer Definition Table (PDT) file. The incorrect formatting will appear as
data printing farther down the page then it is supposed to print.

As an example, a print job that contains an Absolute Vertical Move command at the
end of line 12 that specifies printing should continue on line 24 will generate
printed output that has the next data printed on line 36 instead of on line 24.

This does not occur if the AS/400 print session is not configured to use a PDT in
SNA Server Manager.

CAUSE
=====

The virtual print driver used by SNA Server's host print service does not keep
track of the print job's current line number when a PDT is used for a print
session. Consequently, the 5250 print provider always uses a current line number
of 1 when calculating the number of lines to move down the page when processing
an Absolute Vertical Move command. This results in extra carriage returns being
sent to the printer, which moves the print data too far down the page.

The current line number is tracked when a PDT is not used, which is why this
problem does not occur when a PDT is not used for the AS/400 print session.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack



SNA Server 4.0
--------------

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
Service Pack 1, 3.0 Service Pack 2, 3.0 Service Pack 3, 4.0, and 4.0 Service
Pack 1. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After applying the update, the host print service keeps track of a print job's
current line number when a PDT is used. In addition, a Form Feed will be issued
if the Absolute Vertical Move command specifies a line number lower than the
current line number.

The SCS control code Presentation Position (PP) '0x34' is commonly used in AS/400
(APPC) printing. This control code allows the print position to be moved either
horizontally or vertically, relative to the previous position or to an absolute
position.

The following are the four forms of the Presentation Position SCS control code.

Absolute Horizontal Presentation Position (AHPP) '0x34C0(nn)'

   Parameters: nn - The column number the print position is set to. Example:
   34C00F 34C0 - AHPP 0F - column number 15

Relative Horizontal Presentation Position (RHPP) '0x34C8(nn)'

   Parameters: nn - The number of columns to move from the current print
   position. Example: 34C80F 34C8 - RHPP 0F - 15 columns

Absolute Vertical Presentation Position (AVPP) '0x34C4(nn)'

   Parameters: nn - The line number the print position is set to. Example:
   34C40F 34C4 - AVPP 0F - line number 15

Relative Vertical Presentation Position (RVPP) '0x344C(nn)'

   Parameters: nn - The number of lines to move from the current print position.
   Example: 344C0F 344C - RVPP 0F - 15 lines
