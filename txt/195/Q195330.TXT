SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to change the default tab stops so that every new
document you create that is based on the Normal template will have the same
default tab stop settings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you change the Default Tab Stops option in the Tabs dialog box, Word sets
the default tabs stops for the current document only. New documents will not
reflect the change.

When you create a new document based on the Normal template, the default tab stop
settings occur every 0.5 inch. Therefore, to make certain all new documents have
the same default tab settings, you must open the Normal.dot file and make the
change to the template. Use the following instructions to modify your Normal
template:

1. On the File menu, click Open. Open Normal.dot.

   NOTE: To determine the location of Normal.dot, click Options on the Tools
   menu, click the File Locations tab, and note the path in the User Templates
   setting.

2. On the Format menu, click Tabs.

3. Change Default Tab Stops to the value you want.

4. Click OK.

5. On the File menu, click Save.

6. Close the template.

Now when you create a new document (based on the Normal template), the default
tab stops will be based on the change just made to the Normal template.

NOTE: You can set the default tab stops in any template, following the above
procedure, but instead of opening the Normal template, open the template you
want and make the same changes in steps 2-5.
