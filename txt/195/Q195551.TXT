TITLE   :PRB: SP4 Detects BackOffice Small Business Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,4.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After completing the installation of Windows NT Service Pack 4, you receive a
pop-up message stating that Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server has been
detected, even though you may be running Windows NT Server 4.0 or Windows NT
Workstation 4.0

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because, when Update.exe from Service Pack 4 runs, it checks
to see if the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\SmallBusiness registry key exist.

If this key does exist, Update.exe then tries to determine whether it is
BackOffice Small Business Server v4.0 or v4.0a.

However, if you have installed the Small Business Server Signup Server or if the
Windows NT computer is a member of a Small Business Server domain, the registry
key mentioned above exist.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, click OK to complete the update. This message will not
happen each time you restart. It happens only when applying the service pack.
