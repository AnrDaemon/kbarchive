TITLE   :PRB: Visual C++ Integration: "Specify Working Directory" Dialog
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbSSafe600 kbVC600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a project to Visual SourceSafe in the Visual C++ integrated
development environment a dialog box appears that prompts you to specify a
working directory.

CAUSE
=====

The Visual C++ project contains a file that is not in the Visual C++ project
directory (the directory containing the .dsp file) or a subdirectory underneath
it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Keep all files in the Visual C++ project either in the project directory or
   in a subdirectory underneath it.

 - Create a project structure in Visual SourceSafe that mirrors the directory
   structure on your hard drive before adding the Visual C++ project to Visual
   SourceSafe. In this situation, the Specify Working Directory dialog box
   appears, but the second dialog box described in the MORE INFORMATION section
   below does not appear.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the Specify Working Directory dialog box suggests the Visual C++
project directory. After you click OK and choose to add all files in the Visual
C++ project to Visual SourceSafe, another dialog box appears with the following
message:

   File <filename> could not be mapped to the SourceSafe project
   <project name>

   Copy the file to <VC project directory> ?

You only have the option of copying the file to the Visual C++ project directory,
which may not be the desired location if the Visual C++ project has a
subdirectory structure with different subdirectories for source files, header
files, and so forth. In this case, you need to copy or move the files into the
appropriate directories using Windows Explorer and then add them to the Visual
C++ project.

The relative path in Visual C++ is listed in the "Persist as" field on the
General tab of the Source File Properties dialog box. This is the path that
Visual SourceSafe attempts to resolve relative to the .dsp file in its
database.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a directory structure similar to the following:

      C:\ 
          projects\ 
                    dsphome\ 
                    dspother\ 

2. Create a file (for example, file1.cpp) in the dspother subdirectory.

3. In Visual C++, create a project (for example, proj1.dsp) in the dsphome
   subdirectory.

4. In the Visual C++ File View, add file1.cpp from step 2 to the .dsp.

5. Add the .dsp to Visual SourceSafe, and create a new project to store the
   .dsp.

RESULT: The Specify Working Directory dialog box appears.
