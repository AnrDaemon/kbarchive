======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the steps to recover when the drive containing the
database files for the Microsoft Exchange Server information store and/or the
Exchange Server directory service fails because of hardware problems, and is
unrecoverable and unreadable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps for Recovery
------------------

1. In Control Panel, double-click Services, and set the System Attendant service
   to disabled to prevent the service from trying to start up or being started
   by server monitors.

2. Install a new drive by adding hardware to replace the failed drive.

3. Create a logical drive with the same name as before, and format it.

4. In the <Exchsrvr> directory, create the Mdbdata and/or Dsadata
   subdirectories.

5. Enable the System Attendant, and restore from the last online backup for the
   information store and/or directory store.

6. Start the Exchange Server services.

Because it is assumed that the drive containing the transaction log files is
available, on startup, the service will replay through any log files generated
since the last online backup, and will recover all data.

NOTE: The above steps will result in no data loss ONLY if the transaction logs
were not on the failed drive containing the database files.
