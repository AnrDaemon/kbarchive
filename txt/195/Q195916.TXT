This article states how to monitor Exchange Server Directory connections when

MORE INFORMATION
================

By enabling logging in the Exchange Server Administration program, it is
possible to determine which protocols and/or ports users of Exchange Server are
connecting to the Directory with.

To set this, perform the following steps:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program, click Configuration, click
   Servers, click the <servername>, and then click Directory Service.

2. Click on the Diagnostic Logging tab, and set the Logging level for MAPI
   Interface to "Maximum".

As clients connect to the directory, Events from Source: MSExchangeDS and
Category: MAPI Interface will logged in the Windows NT Event Viewer Application
log. Common events are 1170 and 1136. The User column of the Event Viewer will
list the user that made the connection.
