TITLE   :PRB: Method Code Not Returned Using Object Reference with GETPEM
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOOP kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The GETPEM() function can be used to return the property values and event or
method program code for a given object at design-time. Although not documented
as being supported at run-time, this function does return property values and
event or method code at run-time.

However, when passing an object reference as the first parameter to the GETPEM()
function, an empty string is returned when querying for event or method program
code at run-time.

RESOLUTION
==========

In order to retrieve the event or method code at run-time using the GETPEM()
function, the first parameter must specify the class name rather than a
reference to the object. If the class name is not known, the object's Class
property can be passed as follows:

      GETPEM(oObject.Class, "Init")

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In this context, run-time refers to a compiled Visual FoxPro executable running
with VFP6R.DLL, and design-time means running in the Interactive Development
Environment (IDE) using VFP6.exe.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Run the following code:

      oObject = NEWOBJECT("_form",HOME()+"ffc\_base.vcx")
      cMethodCode = GETPEM(oObject,"Release") && Object Ref = Empty String
      ?LEN(cMethodCode)  && Zero

Note that zero is returned. If the first parameter passed to the GETPEM()
function is changed to oObject.Class, a value greater than zero is returned.
