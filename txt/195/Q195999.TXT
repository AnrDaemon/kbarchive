TITLE   :[MC_]ALLOCATE Contention Winner Request Never Completes
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) or Common Programming
Interface for Communications (CPIC) application attempts to allocate a
contention winner session (by setting rtn_ctl = AP_WHEN_CONWINNER_ALLOCATED),
the [MC_]ALLOCATE or CMALLC request never completes. When SNA Server fails to
negotiate any contention winner sessions with the remote system, the server
fails to reject the client allocation request.

This problem was found while testing the COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI)
feature included with SNA Server 4.0 while the SNA Server APPC mode "minimum
contention winner limit" was set to 0. COMTI allocates contention winner
sessions, so this mode configuration will not function properly.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server was failing to return an error to a client contention winner
request when SNA Server had not negotiated any contention winner sessions with
the remote system.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 3.0
--------------

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft SNA
Server version 3.0 service pack that contains this fix.

later:

      File Name        Date       Time
      ----------------------------------
      Snaservr.exe
      Trcservr.exe

NOTE: The Date and Time information for the above files will be provided in this
article as soon as it becomes available.

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above files
may also contain additional files.

WORKAROUND
==========

Configure SNA Server's APPC mode definition so that the minimum contention
winner limit is greater than 0. This is required in order for APPC or CPIC
applications to successfully allocate contention winner sessions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft SNA Server
versions listed above.
