TITLE   :XADM: Store Crash when IMAP Append Is Aborted on 100 MB Network
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an Internet Message Access Protocol version 4 (IMAP4) Append command from a
client is aborted on a 100-MB network without waiting for the Server Response,
an access violation error may occur in the information store.

CAUSE
=====

The information store loses a connection endpoint, and cleans up properly.
However, the Append function in IMAP does not know this, and tries to access a
member function of the encapsulating net connection class. Because that instance
is not valid, the information store gets an access violation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
