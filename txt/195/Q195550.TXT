SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to view a My Personal Tutor 1st & 2nd grade program using
multiple monitors in Microsoft Windows 98, you may encounter any of the
following symptoms:

 - My Personal Tutor programs may be minimized when you click another program's
   window.

 - Large black areas may appear on the screen after you maximize a My Personal
   Tutor program.

 - When you click a My Personal Tutor program on the taskbar, the program may
   not be maximized, and the taskbar may no longer be visible.

 - When you start a My Personal Tutor program, other programs running on the
   computer may no longer be visible or may only be partially visible on the
   screen.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the My Personal Tutor 1st & 2nd grade
programs are designed to run in full screen mode and, as a result, cannot be
viewed properly using multiple monitors.

MORE INFORMATION
================
