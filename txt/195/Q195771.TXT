TITLE   :Print Server Uses 100% CPU If No Line Formatting Option Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

CPU utilization for SNA Server's Host Print service (Snaprint.exe) may reach 100
percent when 3270 print sessions are configured to use the "No Line Formatting"
option. When this problem occurs, all host print jobs appear to stop printing or
print very slowly.

CAUSE
=====

Print server fails to properly handle some print formatting data that it
receives when the data is split across two RUs (Request Units) when the "No Line
Formatting" option is configured on the 3270 print session receiving the data.

This does not occur if the "No Line Formatting" option is not enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack



SNA Server 4.0
--------------

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 Service
Pack 2, 3.0 Service Pack 3, 4.0, and 4.0 Service Pack 1. This problem was first
corrected in SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "No Line Formatting" option was added in SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 2. The
SNA Server 4.0 Online Help file describes this option as follows:

No Line Formatting:

Prevents the SNA Print Service from inserting its own Carriage Return/Line Feed
(CR/LF) according to the dimensions specified in the Default Page Width field
(also on this property page). As No Line Formatting is a special case, this box
is usually not checked. It is a useful option when using physical printers that
do their own wrapping or are told to do their own wrapping with an Esc sequence.
The Esc sequence that causes a printer to do its own End-of-line wrap on PCL
printers is <Esc>&s0C.
