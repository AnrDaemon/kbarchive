TITLE   :XCLN: Macintosh Outlook Ends Unexpectedly with Type 2 Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:8.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Server is modified to create Container Level Search Control
using Address Book views as mentioned in the following Knowledge Base article:

   Q182902 XADM: How To Setup Container Level Search Control

The idea is to have multiple departments within one Exchange Server organization,
and to prevent these departments from viewing the mailboxes of other departments
in the global address list.

When you use Microsoft Outlook for Windows to create a profile, access the
mailbox and view the global address list. Only the respective mailboxes are
viewed in the global address list, just as expected.

When you use Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, and create
a profile, it quits unexpectedly with the following error message:

   The application "Microsoft Outlook" has unexpectedly quit, because an error
   of Type 2 occurred.

CAUSE
=====

Outlook ends unexpectedly because the Macintosh client expects to receive
information about the home server network address from a property called
PR_EMS_AB_NETWORK_ADDRESS. When Exchange Server returns Permission Denied, the
Macintosh client fails to process this error condition, and quits.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Microsoft Exchange
Server. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh,
Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0. This problem was first corrected in
Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To fix this, both the client and server computers needs modifications as
follows:

Macintosh client
----------------

Modify the Macintosh client to handle Non-existence, Null-value, and Access
Denied cases for the PR_EMS_AB_NETWORK_ADDRESS property.

Exchange Server computer
------------------------

In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, select each of the server
objects in the directory, and grant search permissions to the "Everyone"
account. This will allow the Macintosh client to read the
PR_EMS_AB_NETWORK_ADDRESS attribute off that server, which was originally
inaccessible.
