SYMPTOMS
========

An application may fail to establish a connection to SNA Server when configured
with Novell's intraNetWare Client version 2.2 and the Microsoft SNA Server

SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, and 4.0 SP1. We are
researching this problem in SNA Server version 2.11 and 3.0 and will post more

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
