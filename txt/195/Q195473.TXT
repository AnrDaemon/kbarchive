======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.51 
 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for Access, version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.1 SP2, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Although the Microsoft Access ODBC driver (version 3.51.1713) Data Source Name
(DSN) setup sets the MaxBufferSize value to 512K, the cache size is not capped
at 512K. For example, if an application spins in a loop and inserts records
using SQLSetPos, the process private bytes grow to about 13 MBs rather than the
expected 512K.

Looking at the registry entries for the DSN, you might see something like the
following:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER
     Software
        ODBC
           ODBC.INI
                AccessTest
                     Engines
                         Jet
                            MaxBufferSize = 512

AccessTest is the name of the DSN. The MaxBufferSize setting has no effect for
the DSN.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Access ODBC driver is ignoring the DSN MaxBufferSize setting.
However, the driver is using the MaxBufferSize setting of Jet under the
HKEY_LOCAL_LACHINE\Jet\3.5\Engines\Jet 3.5\MaxBufferSize setting.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Microsoft Access ODBC driver uses the MaxBufferSize setting for Jet to
determine its maximum buffer size.

The Jet MaxBufferSize is a registry entry in the following path:

   HKEY_LOCAL_LACHINE\Jet\3.5\Engines\Jet 3.5

It is normally set to zero (0). The setting of zero indicates that Jet uses a
default algorithm to determine the maximum cache size. That algorithm is
"(((Total RAM on computer in MB - 12MB) / 4) + 512K)". This returns a value
equal to the number of pages that the cache size can increase. Each page is 2048
bytes, so for a computer with at least 64 MB of RAM, this algorithm returns
approximately 14 MB. This is the maximum memory that Jet consumes from its
startup point.

Following is an example of the calculation for a 64 MB computer:

   (64Mb - 12Mb) / 4 + 512K
   = 52Mb/4 + 512K
   = 13Mb + 512K
   = 13.5Mb

Jet will not allow the "Total RAM on computer" calculated earlier to exceed 64
MB. If the total RAM on the computer is 12 MB or less, then the algorithm
creates a 512 KB cache buffer.

Jet will use memory for its cache until it reaches this dynamic setting if the
MaxBufferSize registry setting is zero (0). If the MaxBufferSize registry
setting is set at 512 KB, for example, the cache size will be limited to 512 KB.
Once Jet exceeds the setting, it fires off a background thread to reduce the
memory to the point that it goes below the maximum cache size setting.

You can typically minimize the growth of the Jet cache by dropping a HSTMT()
statement handle and creating a new one. In this case, the memory at the
beginning of the Jet cache will be re-used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
