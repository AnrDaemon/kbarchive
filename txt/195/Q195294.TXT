KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbOSWinCEsearch kbOSWinCE100 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a project created with either the Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic (VBCE)
or eMbedded Visual Basic (eVB), KeyDown event procedures are triggered in the
emulator when using ARROW keys to navigate among buttons on a form. This
behavior does not occur on remote devices.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem should only affect testing of VBCE applications.

KeyDown event procedures for non-editing controls such as command buttons,
checkboxes, and option buttons, are not triggered using ARROW keys in
applications made with regular Visual Basic and VBCE applications run on remote
devices.

These event procedures do occur when running VBCE applications in the emulation
environment. Only when testing VBCE applications in the emulation environment
will this incorrect behavior occur.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE project in either Visual Basic or eMbedded Visual
   Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a text box, two command buttons, an option button, and a check box to
   Form1.

3. Set the MultiLine property of the text box to True and the ScrollBars
   property of the Textbox to 2 - Vertical.

4. Add the following code to the Form1 code module:

         Private Sub Check1_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
            Text1.Text = Text1.Text & vbCrLf & "Check1 KeyDown: " & KeyCode
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command1_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
            Text1.Text = Text1.Text & vbCrLf & "Cmd1 KeyDown: " & KeyCode
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command2_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
            Text1.Text = Text1.Text & vbCrLf & "Cmd2 KeyDown: " & KeyCode
         End Sub

         Private Sub Option1_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
            Text1.Text = Text1.Text & vbCrLf & "Option1 KeyDown: " & KeyCode
         End Sub

         Private Sub Text1_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
            Text1.Text = Text1.Text & vbCrLf & "Text1 KeyDown: " & KeyCode
         End Sub

5. Run the project in the emulation environment. Use ARROW keys to move through
   the command buttons, check box, and option button. Note that the KeyDown
   event procedures are triggered, which is indicated by the text added to the
   text box. Running the same project on a remote device, the KeyDown event
   procedures are not triggered.
