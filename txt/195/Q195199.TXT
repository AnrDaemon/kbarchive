TITLE   :WD97: Frame Border Indented When You Indent Text in Frame
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97 kbframe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you indent text within a frame, Microsoft Word also indents the frame
border.

NOTE: By default, Frame is not an option on the Insert menu. Frames are still
available in Word 97; however, in most cases, you should use a text box rather
than a frame. Text boxes were added to Word 97 to provide a better way to
manipulate text and to take advantage of new graphical effects. Text boxes
provide nearly all the advantages of frames as well as many additional
advantages that frames do not provide.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Use a Text Box
------------------------

To insert a text box, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Customize, and then click the Toolbars tab.

2. Click to select the Drawing check box, and then click Close.

3. Click to select the Text Box button on the Drawing toolbar, and then click
   and drag in your document to draw a text box.

4. Type and indent the text you want in the text box.

Method 2: Use a Table Inside the Frame
--------------------------------------

1. After you create your frame, insert a one row, one column table.

2. Specify an indent for the cell paragraph.

3. Type the text you want inside the framed table cell.
