SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) includes Security Configuration Manager
(SCM) as an optional component. SCM is an integrated security system that gives
administrators the ability to define and apply security configurations for
Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server installations. SCM also has the
capability to perform inspections of the installed systems to locate any
degradation in the system's security. For further information on SCM, including
installation and usage instructions, refer to the Readme.txt file in the Mssce
folder on your Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 CD-ROM.

NOTE: The Readme.txt file refers to the Security Configuration Manager as the
Security Configuration Editor. These names are interchangeable.

================

The Web and ftp downloads of Service Pack 4 do not include the additional
optional features that are available on the Service Pack 4 CD. For your
