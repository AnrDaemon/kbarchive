SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create and save custom label settings in a
template. When you use the Custom Label option in Envelopes And Labels, you can
only create and save one custom setting. If you modify that setting, the
previous setting is lost. If you create a custom label and save it as a
template, your custom setting is saved even if you create another custom label.

Create a Custom Label Sheet
---------------------------

There are several ways to create a label sheet. This article describes three
methods you can use to design the label sheet. Start each method after creating
a new blank document.

Method 1: Define the Custom Label
---------------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Envelopes And Labels.

2. Click the Labels tab.

3. Click Options.

4. Under Printer Information, click to select your printer type, Dot Matrix or
   Laser And Ink Jet.

5. Click New Label.

6. In the Label Name box, type a name for your custom label. Enter the exact
   height and width measurements of one label and the number of labels across
   and down one page. You may also need to adjust the margins and pitches
   slightly.

7. Click OK.

   NOTE: If the following prompt appears

   The margins, label size, and number across or down values produce a page that
   is larger than the label page size.

   click OK, and then verify that your label dimensions and page margins combined
   aren't larger than the actual paper size.

8. Click OK.

9. Click New Document.

   NOTE: If the paper size of the label sheet is something other than the default
   8.5-by-11 inch size, change the paper size and document margins. To do this,
   follow these steps:

   a. On the File menu, click Page Setup. Then click the Paper Size tab.

   b. Change the Width and Height values.

10. Save the document as a template. For more information on how to save the
   template, see the "Save the New Template" section later in this article.

Method 2: Choose a Predefined Label and Modify the Measurements
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Envelopes And Labels.

2. Click the Labels tab.

3. Click Options.

4. Under Printer Information, click to select your printer type, Dot Matrix or
   Laser.

5. In the Label Products list, select Avery Standard.

6. In the Product Number list, choose the Avery label with the closest
   dimensions to your custom label.

   NOTE: Verify that the Avery Label page size is close to your label sheet.
   Click Details and verify that the Number Across and Number Down are correct.

7. Click OK twice and then click New Document. The labels appear in a table.

8. Make any necessary changes to the labels by selecting the table and changing
   the cell height and width measurements (Table menu) for each label, and the
   margins (File menu, Page Setup) for the label sheet.

9. Save the document as a template. For more information on how to save the
   template, see the "Save the New Template" section later in this article.

Method 3: Create a New Table and Use Precise Measurements
---------------------------------------------------------

1. On the File menu, click Page Setup.

2. Click the Paper Size tab.

3. Change the Width and Height values to match your specific label sheet size.

4. Click the Margins tab.

5. Set the Top margin equal to the distance from the top edge of the label sheet
   to the top edge of the first label. Do the same for the Bottom, Left, and
   Right margins. Click OK.

6. On the Table menu, click Insert Table.

7. Type the Number of Rows and Number of Columns per sheet and click OK.

8. On the Table menu, click Select Table.

9. On the Table menu, click Cell Height And Width.

10. Click the Row tab.

11. Change the Height of Rows to Exactly. In the At box, type the number of
   inches for the height of the label. For example, if the label is 1.5 inches
   high, enter "1.5 in" (without the quotation marks).

   NOTE: If you don't use the suffix "in," Word uses points by default. For this
   example, you could also use "108 pts".

12. Click the Column tab. Change the Width Of Columns value to the width of one
   label in inches. Change the spacing between columns if needed.

   NOTE: The default measurement for columns is inches.

13. Click OK.

14. Save the document as a template.

Save the New Template
---------------------

1. On the File menu, click Save As.

2. Type a name for the template.

3. In the Save File As Type box, click Document Template. The file name should
   now have a .dot extension.

   NOTE: Make sure you save the file in the Template folder.

4. Click OK.

   At this point you can close the template and create a new document.

5. On the File menu, click Close.

6. On the File menu, click New.

7. Select the template you just created and click OK.

You are ready to begin typing names in each label. Use the TAB key to move from
one label to the next.
