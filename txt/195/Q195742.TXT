SYMPTOMS
========

When Exchange Server receives an X.400 message coded with General-Text and
containing no body text but only an attachment, the message transfer agent (MTA)
may generate a non-delivery-report (NDR) back to the originator, and log the
following conversion error in the Event Log:

   Event: 210
   Description: An internal MTA error occurred. Content conversion for
   message C=FR;A=ATLAS;P=myPRMD;L=BB92FC5311D26E5B5246B7B8 failed.
   Conversion error: 4096, Object at fault: 06000100, Original content
   type: 56010A01, New content type: 2A864886F7140501. PDU dump reference
   8420 [MTA XFER-IN 13 112] (14)

This occurs when the first body-part contains only CR LF.

==========
