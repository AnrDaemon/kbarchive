TITLE   :PRB: Specifying View KeyField Sets Other Fields Updateable

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Specifying the keyfield of a View sets the rest of the fields to be updateable,
although the fields are not being set to be updateable explicitly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a DBSETPROP() command similar to the following to clear the fields in the
view that you do not want to be updateable:

      DBSETPROP("TstVw.Fld1","Field","Updatable",.F.)

Also, you can open the view in the View Designer and clear the fields that you do
not want to be updateable, from the Update Criteria tab.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Create and run a program with the following code:

      CLOSE DATA ALL
      CREATE DATA TstDBC
      CREATE TABLE Tbl1 (Fld1 c(10),Fld2 d, Fld3 n(4))
      FOR i = 1 TO 4
         INSERT INTO Tbl1 VALUES (STR(i),DATE(),1234)
      ENDFOR
      CREATE SQL VIEW TstVw AS SELECT * FROM Tbl1
      USE TstVw
      =DBSETPROP("TstVw.Fld1","Field","KeyField",.T.)
      ? DBGETPROP("TstVw.Fld2","Field","Updatable")
      ? DBGETPROP("TstVw.Fld3","Field","Updatable")

If the table for which the view is being created has a primary key, then that
field is set as the keyfield automatically when the view is created. The
following code reproduces this behavior:

      CLOSE DATA ALL
      CREATE DATA TstDBC
      CREATE TABLE Tbl1 (fld1 c(10) PRIMARY KEY,fld2 d, fld3 n(4))
      FOR i = 1 TO 4
         INSERT INTO Tbl1 VALUES (STR(i),DATE(),1234)
      ENDFOR
      CREATE SQL VIEW TstVw AS SELECT * FROM tbl1
      USE TstVw
      ? DBGETPROP("TstVw.Fld2","Field","Updatable")
      ? DBGETPROP("TstVw.Fld3","Field","Updatable")

Note that both of the DBGETPROP() commands return .T., meaning that both of the
fields are updateable.
