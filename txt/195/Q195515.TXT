PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When using the Microsoft Exchange Move Server Wizard, after completing the
server move, a full online backup should be performed on the following servers:

 - The server you moved.

 - The server you specified as the reference server in the destination site if
   you joined an existing site.

 - All servers in the original site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is important that you perform a full online backup rather than an incremental
or differential backup. The incremental and differential backups will not secure
your data in the destination site.

For more information on performing a full online backup, see Microsoft Exchange
Server Maintenance and Troubleshooting.
