PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbhw kbsetup kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) on a laptop computer that
already has SystemSoft's CardWizard version 3.00.01 (or earlier) installed, the
PCMCIA socket services do not start and your computer may stop responding
(hang).

CAUSE
=====

The service pack Setup program installs the Microsoft Pcmcia.sys file over the
custom device driver file provided with the CardWizard product.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove the incorrect driver:

Hard Disk Using the FAT File System
-----------------------------------

1. Start your computer from a bootable MS-DOS disk and rename the Pcmcia.sys
   file in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers folder to another name (such as
   Pcmcia.old).

   For information about how to rename a file, click Start, click Help, click the
   Index tab, type "rename" (without quotation marks), and then double-click the
   "Renaming files" topic.

   hidden folder to the %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers folder.

   Options) on the View menu, click the View tab, click Show All Files, and then
