When you paste a selection that contains a bookmark as the first item in the
selection into a new document, the bookmark may be lost.

WORKAROUND

To work around this behavior, make sure the selection contains some information
(for example, a space) before the bookmark. When you paste the selection, the
bookmark will be retained.

STATUS

cross-references.
