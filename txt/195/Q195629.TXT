SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may occur when you add a new item to a catalog when

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the October Visual FoxPro
6.0 Component Gallery and FoxPro Foundation Classes (FFC) updates.

MORE INFORMATION

This error is intermittent on some computers; however, once it does occur, it is
likely to continue to occur until you exit Visual FoxPro.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Launch Component Gallery.

2. Create a new catalog in a different directory other than the ..\Gallery
   directory. For example, in the C:\Temp directory.

3. While Component Gallery is still running, go to Command window and issue the
   following command: SET DEFAULT TO HOME()+"Gallery\Graphics"

4. Select the newly create catalog in Component Gallery, then right-click the
   right panel of the Component Gallery. In the shortcut menu, point to New
   Item. When the Open dialog box appears, navigate to the graphics directory
   and select a .bmp file.

   RESULTS: The following error occurs:

   File C:\Temp\vfpgrly.vcx not found
