TITLE   :FIX: LNK1104 When Linking VXD with /MAP
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbLinker kbVC600bug kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kbVS600sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Linker (LINK.EXE), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Linking a VXD (/VXD switch) with the /MAP switch to generate a map file may
result in the following error:

   LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file "<filename>.map"

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no workaround for this problem. You must either not generate a map file
for the VXD, or build the VXD using the linker supplied with the DDK.

The Visual C++ linker as shipped in the retail product does not support the
generation of VxDs.

To generate VxDs, a developer must use the Windows 9x or Windows NT DDK build
environment, which includes a linker that will generate VxDs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service
Pack 3. For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the
