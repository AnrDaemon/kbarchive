TITLE   :PRB: C4786 After Porting from Version 5.0 to Version 6.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINNT:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbSTL kbVC600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When building a project with Visual C++ 6.0 that compiles without a C4786
warning in Visual C++ 5.0, you may receive C4786 warnings, sometimes followed
by:

   Fatal Error C1033: cannot open program database 'vc60.pdb'.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Visual C++ 5.0, using the following

      #pragma warning (disable : 4786)

after including STL headers, disables the warning:

   C4786:'identifier' : identifier was truncated to 'number' characters in the
   debug information.

However, this method does not disable all such warnings in Visual C++ version
6.0. The occurrence of many C4786 warnings may result in the following:

   C1033 error: cannot open program database 'vc60.pdb'.

Use the pragma directive before you include any STL headers to disable the
warnings.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

      // compile options required: /Zi /GX
      #include <iostream>
      #include <string>
      #include <map>

      // move this pragma before the includes above to disable the
      //C4786 warnings
      #pragma warning (disable : 4786)

      int main () {
         using namespace std;
         map<int,string> m;
         m[0] = "hello world";
         cout << m[0] << endl;

         return 0;
      }
