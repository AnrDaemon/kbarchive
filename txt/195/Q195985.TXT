TITLE   :XADM: Move Mailbox Fails with Client Operation Failed Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you move a user in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, the
move may fail and the following error message is displayed.

   Client Operation Failed 80004005-0501-80004005

CAUSE
=====

The data in the mailbox is moved through a buffer in memory. If a property's
data straddled a buffer, there was a chance that the property would be changed
to PT_NULL and memory allocated for the property could not be freed.

This caused the failure in move user.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
