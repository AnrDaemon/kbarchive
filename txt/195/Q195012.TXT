TITLE   :Queued 3270 Print Jobs May Intermittently Print Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Host print jobs printed through SNA Server's Host Print Server may print
incorrectly at times. In the reported instance of this problem, two host print
jobs were sent to the print server from the mainframe at approximately the same
time. One of the print jobs printed correctly, but only part of the other job
printed. The actual symptoms may vary.

The problem is most likely to occur when one or both of the following are true:

 - The mainframe sends multiple print jobs to the print server at the same time.

 - The print server has numerous sessions active concurrently so that each one
   is processing quite slowly.

This problem can affect 3270 print jobs using both LU1 (SCS) and LU3 print
sessions.

CAUSE
=====

The 3270 Print Provider (Ppd3270.dll) uses a mechanism for queuing messages
received from the host that can allow messages for different print jobs destined
for the same print device to be intermixed.

==========
