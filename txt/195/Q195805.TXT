TITLE   :XWEB: 24-Hour Clock does not Convert 2359 Hours Correctly in OWA

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When using the Outlook Web Access client, you may choose to display time in a
24-hour format. This can be accomplished by selecting the Options icon from the
Outlook bar, and selecting "Display 24-hour clock" check box.

However, if you select 12 midnight (2359 hours) as your day end time, the time is
incorrectly converted. If you clear the "Display 24-hour clock" check box after
entering 2359 as your day end time, the time is converted to 12:00 PM rather
than displaying 12:00 AM. If you recheck this option, the time is displayed as
12:00. If after entering the day end time as 2359 you select OK, reopening the
Options icon displays the day end time as 0:00.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not set the clock in OWA to use the 24-hour format if the day end time will
be midnight. Use standard time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
