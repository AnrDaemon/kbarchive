SUMMARY
=======

When you save a document in Word 97, certain document properties get
automatically populated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view the document properties, click Properties on the File menu.

When the document is saved, the Title, by default, is populated with the first
line of text from the document.

The Author, by default, is populated with the name that appears in the User
Information tab (on the Tools menu, click Options).

The Company, by default, is populated by the company name that was used when Word
97 was installed.

To work around these default settings, follow these steps:

All Document Properties
-----------------------

To make sure that all document properties are saved with the properties that you
need, on the File menu, click Options. Click the Save tab and select the "Prompt
for document properties" option. When you save the document, you can change the
Title, Author, or Company to the settings you want for that particular
document.

Title Property
--------------

You can set the default Title for the Normal template or any template you are
using by opening the template and changing the Title under File Properties to
reflect the title you want when a document is saved.

To modify the template, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Open.

2. In the Files Of Type list, click Document Templates.

3. Go to the User Template directory or to the directory where the Normal.dot
   file is located. The default location is:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates

4. Click the Normal.dot icon, and then click Open.

5. On the File menu, click Properties.

6. In the Title field, type the title that you want or type spaces for a blank
   title.

7. Save and close the template.

Author Property
---------------

You can set the default Author by changing the name in the User Information tab.

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the User Information tab.

3. Change the name to the author name you want.

NOTE: You can place spaces in the Name field to have the name blank when the
document is saved.
