KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, versions 7.0, 7.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Microsoft Schedule+ as your primary calendar in Microsoft Outlook,
you may receive the following error message when attempting to start Schedule+
from within Outlook:

   The file '<drive>:\<OS>\forms\configs\req32.cfg' could not be
   opened.
   Microsoft Exchange Forms Registry.

The Configs folder does not exist and the Req32.cfg file resides in a different
folder.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange client is not installed on this computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

Include the Exchange client during the installation of Schedule+.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Exchange client controls the workgroup functionality of Schedule+. Without
it Schedule+ is installed in standa-lone mode. Outlook does not detect whether
Schedule+ has workgroup capabilities when being configured to use Schedule+ as
its primary calendar. It only requires that Schedule+ be installed and
operational.

If you start Schedule+ from the Start, Programs menu, you are not presented the
dialog box to choose the options to work in group-enabled mode or to work alone.
It provides the options to create a new schedule file or to use and existing
schedule file but does not offer the option to NOT have a schedule file on this
machine. This is because Schedule+ does not have online capabilities without
Exchange client being installed.
