TITLE   :Resource Kit Perfmib.dll Cannot Read Some SNMP Counters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing the Perf2Mib utility from the Windows NT Resource Kit, SNMP
queries to various Performance Monitor Object Counters return a value of zero.

CAUSE
=====

The Perfmib.dll does not handle object instances correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

A new version of Perfmib.dll that resolves this problem is available on:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt40/<Platform>

Please note that the Perf2Mib utility has been removed from the Resource Kit as
of Supplement2 and, consequently, future issues concerning the tool will not be
addressed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using Perf2mib.exe, the Performance Monitor MIB Builder Tool, developers can
create new ASN.1 syntax MIBs for their applications, services, or devices that
use Performance Monitor counters. Administrators can then track performance of
these components by using any system-management program that supports SNMP.

This tool also creates a .mib file that can be used by an SNMP-based management
console to perform SNMP requests for the performance data in question and, thus,
to monitor performance remotely. This allows all performance data available
through the HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA registry key to be exposed through SNMP.
