-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word, if you press CTRL+SHIFT+F8 to select a column of text and
then apply character formatting, the text does not remain selected after you
apply the formatting.

CAUSE
=====

When you press CTRL+SHIFT+F8, the Column Selection mode is activated, and you
can use the arrow keys to select a column of text. If you apply character
formatting to the selected text, the width of the characters changes. This can
cause the column selection to no longer be accurate. Therefore, the text
selection is lost when character formatting is applied.

NOTE: You can also perform a column selection by holding the ALT key while
clicking and dragging with the left mouse button.
