TITLE   :WD97: WordPerfect Table Formulas Are Not Retained in Word
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbdta kbconversion winword word97

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, when you open a WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS or WordPerfect
5.1 or 5.2 for Windows document containing tables with formulas (table math),
only the latest recalculated results of the formulas are retained as normal
text. The formulas themselves are lost.

CAUSE
=====

This is a current design limitation of the WordPerfect converters supplied with
the Word family of products.

WORKAROUND
==========

Word for Windows does support performing calculations within table cells. To
restore mathematical relationships among table cells, re-enter the formulas
after the conversion is complete.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WordPerfect's Table Math option allows you to define math formulas that add,
subtract, multiply, and divide the values you put into referenced cells in much
the same way you can in Word.

WordPerfect's Table Formulas are separate from WordPerfect Equations, which Word
versions 2.0b and later do retain during conversion.
