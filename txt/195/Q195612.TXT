TITLE   :Local Named Object Is Mistakenly Created in Global Name Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:TSESP4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When developing an application to run under Windows Terminal Server, a call to
the RpcServerUseProtseqEp() API may cause any subsequent named objects to be
created in the global name space versus the name space of the client user. Any
Win32 API which creates names objects may be affected if called following a call
to RpcServerUseProtseqEp().

For example, if a named pipes application were to create an event object using
the CreateEvent() API following a call to the RpcServerUseProtseqEp() API, the
event object would be created in the global name space instead of the preferred
local name space of the Windows Terminal Server user. If the named object is
created before calling the above offending RPC API, the named object is created
in the correct user name space.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is that the RcpServerUseProtSeqEp() API does not properly restore
the user environment when returning from kernel mode.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
