TITLE   :SP4 and SP5 Winlogon Problems with Old Entries in LMHosts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 (SP4) or later, installed, use entries in the
LMHosts file with #PRE and will never query a WINS server. In the event that you
have entries for your domain #DOM preloaded #PRE that are no longer valid,
Windows NT will no longer query a WINS server to find updated entries.

CAUSE
=====

In Service Pack 3, Windows NT would query a WINS server and, if an entry was not
there, it would then use the entry in the LMHosts file (even if the entries were
preloaded). With SP4, Windows NT will not query a WINS server. Instead it will
only use the entries in the LMHosts file that have been preloaded.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem remove or update any outdated entries that are being
preloaded in the LMHosts file.

STATUS
======

This functionality is by design.
