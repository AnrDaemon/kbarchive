SUMMARY
=======

When you first create a table in Word, the table width fits exactly between the
margins. If you change the margins, the table does not automatically resize to
fit the new settings.

This article explains how to make the table conform to the new margins.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After changing the margins, follow these steps to adjust the table:

1. On the Table menu, click Select Table.

2. On the Table menu, click Cell Height And Width.

3. Click the Columns tab.

4. Click AutoFit and click OK.

The table now is as wide as the typing area.
