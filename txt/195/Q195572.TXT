SUMMARY
=======

Not all fonts appear in the Symbol dialog box.

The Symbol dialog box in Microsoft Word contains a Symbols From list box. The
fonts listed in this box are either Decorative family fonts or fonts that have a
non-ANSI/OEM character set (for example, Symbol or Zapf Dingbats). Fonts that do
not appear in the Symbols From box include ANSI character set fonts (for
example, Times Roman and Helvetica).

To access the Symbol dialog box, do the following:

Method 1
--------

On the Insert menu, click Symbol.

Method 2
--------

1. On the Format menu, click Bullets And Numbering.

2. On the Bulleted tab, click one of the bullet styles, and then click
   Customize.

3. Click Bullet.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you want to use a font that is not listed, you can type the name of the font
in the Symbols From box. The font symbol grid is not updated automatically;
after you type the font name, you must either press ENTER or select one of the
characters on the symbol grid to display your chosen font.

For example, if you want to choose a symbol or bullet from the Courier font set,
type Courier in the Symbols From box and then either press ENTER or select a
cell on the symbol grid to view the Courier characters, and then select your
symbol or new bullet character from the Courier font set.

NOTE: In Word for Windows 97, if a font is not a Unicode font, the contents of
the Symbol dialog box will actually be Courier or CG Times. Two examples of such
fonts are Bookshelf Symbol 1 and Bookshelf Symbol 2.
