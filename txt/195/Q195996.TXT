======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following symptoms can occur when SNA Server incorrectly handles cancelled
allocate requests:

 - An Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) or Common Programming
   Interface for Communications (CPIC) application's call to [MC_]ALLOCATE or
   CMALLC may hang indefinitely. This may occur after a previous allocation
   request has been cancelled, or after the SNA Server connection has been
   restarted.

 - If an APPC or CPIC application subsequently cancels an outstanding
   [MC_]ALLOCATE or CMALLC request (by calling the cancel verb, or by calling
   TP_ENDED, or if the client-server LAN session is lost), the SNA Server may
   later fail unexpectedly with an access violation (C0000005) in routine
   s1prfrcb() or s1puc62() as indicated by the Drwtsn32.log entry.

The following Knowledge Base article has additional information when this problem
results in an access violation in the s1prfrcb() routine:

   Title: SNA Server Access Violation in s1prfrcb()

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server was incorrectly handling the cancellation of a pending [MC_]ALLOCATE
or CMALLC request. This caused the SNA Server to prevent unused LU 6.2 sessions
from being used. If many cancelled client allocation requests are received, this
could lead to an SNA Server access violation.


RESOLUTION
==========

--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
