SUMMARY
=======

Launching the Batch file generated by the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW)
after making changes to the control does not include the latest version of the
control in the cab file. Therefore, the changes are not reflected when you
launch the HTML file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here are the steps to follow to make sure that the latest version of the control
is included in the cab file:

1. Compile your control after making/saving changes. Make sure that your control
   is Binary Compatible. To make your control binary Compatible, follow these
   steps:

   a. Before making the OCX for the first time, go to project properties,
      components tab and click the "no compatibility" button.

   b. Go to file menu and select "make OCX."

   c. Go back to the components tab under project properties and click the
      "Binary compatible" button. Type the complete path of the .OCX file you
      just created in the text box under that option, or click the command
      button next to the text box, which will bring the file dialog box up where
      you can select the .OCX file.

   d. Click OK. Go back to the file menu and make the OCX. Make sure you select
      the same OCX when prompted, and click "Yes" when asked if you want to
      overwrite the previous OCX. This assures that the control is binary
      compatible.

2. Copy the new version of the OCX in the support directory generated by PDW, as
   this is not updated.

3. Modify the .INF file to change the version number under the section for this
   control.

4. Now run the batch file.

5. Modify the .HTML file such that the codebase attribute has the version =
   <the latest version number>.

6. Now launch the HTML file and the new version of the control should be
   downloaded on the client machine.
