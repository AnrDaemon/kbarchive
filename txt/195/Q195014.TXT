TITLE   :Outlook 98 May Install Incorrectly on Windows NT Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Microsoft Outlook 98 is installed on Windows Terminal Server, the Actions
menu is blank. Also, no menu appears when you right-click messages. If Office 97
is installed with Outlook 97, and then upgraded to Outlook 98, the Actions menu
works as expected.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Outlook 98 standalone setup ignores a registry
entry. This is not a problem in the code.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do the following to install Outlook 98 standalone:

1. Create a local administrator user named Installer.

2. Log on as Installer at the console.

3. Open a command prompt and type "change user /install" (without the quotation
   marks).

4. Install Outlook 98.

5. Open a command prompt and type "change user /execute" (without the quotation
   marks).

6. Allow the system to restart after the installation finishes.

7. Log on as Installer and start a command prompt.

8. Open a command prompt and type "change user /install" (without the quotation
   marks).

9. Run Outlook 98.

10. Exit Outlook 98.

11. Edit the Office97.cmd file in the %SystemRoot%\Application Compatibility
   Scripts\Install folder. Modify line 24 as follows:

   ..\ACRegL %Temp%\O97.Cmd O97INST
   "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\InstallRoot" "OfficeBin"
   "STRIPCHAR\1"

12. Run the new Office97.cmd script.

13. Log off.

Outlook 98 should work normally for all users except for Installer.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition.
