KEYWORDS:kbdta kbfield kbformula winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you calculate the sum of a series of cells that contain numbers preceded by
a plus (+) sign, the result is incorrectly shown as the sum of the negative
numbers contained in the series or may be shown as zero when each of the numbers
in the series is preceded by a plus sign.

-or-

When you calculate the average of a series of cells that contain numbers preceded
by a plus (+) sign, the result is incorrectly shown as the average of the
negative numbers or may be shown as 0.0 when each of the numbers in the series
is preceded by a plus sign.

WORKAROUND
==========

Method 1: Remove the Plus Signs
-------------------------------

The plus sign is not required by Word to identify the number as positive.

Method 2: Move the Plus Signs to a New Column
---------------------------------------------

Add a column to your table, move the plus signs to the new column, and then
update the formula field.

NOTE: Do not move the negative signs to the new column, or your formula field
result will be incorrect.

STATUS
======
