TITLE   :SMS: Changes to the SMS Installer Parse String Function
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,2.0; winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsmsInst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Parse String action is used to break a string up into two pieces and insert
those pieces into two new variables, Destination Variable 1 and Destination
Variable 2. A parse token is used to indicate the position within the string
where it should be split. Before build 35 of Systems Management Server Installer
1.0, the parse token was not included in either variable. Due to customer
requests, builds 35 and higher of the Systems Management Server Installer 1.0
include the parse token on Destination Variable 2. However, this change to the
parse string function may affect the behavior of scripts written before build
35. For this reason, the original functionality of the Parse String action was
restored in Systems Management Server Installer 2.0 builds 55 and higher.
Systems Management Server Installer 2.0 adds an "Include Parse Token in
destination variable 2" check box to the PARSE STRING function.
