TITLE   :BUG: MsDev Caused an Invalid Page Fault in Devedit.pkg
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbVC600 kbVC600bug kbDSupport kbNoUpdate

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Visual C++ 6.0, you get the following error message soon after
the splash screen is displayed:

   MsDev caused an invalid page fault C0000005 in devedit.pkg at 0171:50809e6d

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by a corrupted PKG file that is being accessed by
Devedit.pkg. The Devedit.pkg module is using the corrupted PKG file to look up
information about how to display text.

This problem happens only under very rare circumstances; however, on some
systems, one of these PKG files gets corrupted during installation.


RESOLUTION
==========

Manually copy the PKG files from directory \Common\Msdev98\Bin\Ide on CD-1, to
the ...\Common\Msdev98\Bin\Ide on your hard drive--replacing the ones that the
setup program put onto your system. Copy these PKG files (depending on the
product edition, you may not have all of the following files):

   devodl.pkg
   devdtg.pkg
   devhtmx.pkg
   devent.pkg
   devcpp.pkg
   devaut1.pkg

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
