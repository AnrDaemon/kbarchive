SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server unexpectedly logs the following event in the Windows NT application
event log:

   Event ID: 3
   Source: SNA Server

or Common Programming Interface for Communications (CPIC) application attempts
to allocate a conversation (by calling [MC_]ALLOCATE or CMALLC), and specifies
an APPC mode name which is not configured in SNA Server.

RESOLUTION

Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0
