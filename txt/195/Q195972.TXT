TITLE   :BUG: Data Report Not Always in WindowList
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbReportWriter kbVBp kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An MDIFORM does not show the child form in the WindowList menu if the child form
is a Data Report. If the Data Report is minimized and then returned to a normal
state, it will show up in the WindowList.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, add code to your program that minimizes the report
prior to opening the report in normal mode. Refer to the Steps to Reproduce
Behavior section of this article for sample code on this workaround.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add an MDIFORM to the project.

3. Add a menu to the form, and check the WindowList property, as follows:

   

      Caption: View
      Name:  mnuView

4. Add a Data Report to the project and then add a Data Environment. Set the
   Datasource property and the Datamember property. You don't have to drop any
   fields onto the report in order to see the problem.

5. Set the MDICHILD property to True on Form1 and DataReport1.

6. Add a CommandButton to Form1 and, in the Click event, show the DataReport
   (DataReport1.Show).

7. Run the application. If you select the View menu, Form1 shows up. Click the
   CommandButton and select the View menu again. Note that the DataReport is not
   listed in the WindowList.

   If you modify the Click event of the CommandButton to do the following, the
   DataReport appears in the WindowList as expected:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
          DataReport1.Visible = False
          DataReport1.WindowState = vbMinimized

          DataReport1.WindowState = vbNormal
          DataReport1.Show
         End Sub
