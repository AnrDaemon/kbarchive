SYMPTOMS
========

Page breaks in a Word for Windows table in Normal view may not appear as
expected. Sometimes the page break appears at the sides of the table, and
sometimes it appears within one or more of the row cells only.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior depends upon whether there are multiple lines within a table cell
at the page break and whether "Allow row to break across pages" has been
selected for the particular row of the table. To find this setting, do the
following:

1. On the Table menu, click Cell Height and Width, and then select the Row tab.

2. Under Indent from Left, select or clear the "Allow row to break across pages"
   check box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: In the following examples, the page break is indicated with a dotted line
(.....).
