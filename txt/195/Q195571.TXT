TITLE   :WD97: Superscript and Subscript Underline Misaligned in Word
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta kbfield word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word, the underline for subscript text does not align with the
underline for normal text.

WORKAROUND
==========

Method 1: Use the Line Tool
---------------------------

Use the Line tool on the Drawing toolbar to draw lines under the text to simulate
underlining.

TIP: Hold down the SHIFT key while drawing lines to keep the line horizontal.

Method 2: Use an Equation Field to Create an Underscore Character
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Create an equation field using the overstrike function to underscore words or
phrases that contain superscript and subscript characters, similar to the
following

   Syntax: {eq \o(<Text>,<Underscore characters>)}

as in the following example:

   {eq \o(Apple,_____)}

The braces for the equation field are created by pressing CTRL+F9. Type the text
between the braces.

In the syntax above, <Text> is the string containing all the text to be
underlined (normal as well as superscript and subscript text), and
<Underscore characters> are the actual characters to underscore the "Text"
characters.

NOTE: The underscore character may not match the one used by the underline
character format command. You may need to experiment with different underscore
characters (different fonts, point sizes, and so forth) to achieve a continuous
underscore effect.
