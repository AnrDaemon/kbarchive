SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to find and replace bold, italic, and underline
formatting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use one of the following methods to replace bold, italic, or underline
formatting.

Method 1: Use the Format Button in the Find and Replace Dialog Box
------------------------------------------------------------------

To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Edit menu, click Replace.

2. Delete any existing text from the "Find what" and "Replace with" boxes.

3. Click in the "Find what" box.

4. Click the Format button, and then click Font.

   NOTE: If you do not see the Format button, click More.

5. Select the formats you want to find, such as "Underline" style or "Font
   style," and then click OK.

6. Click in the "Replace with" box.

7. Click the Format button, and then click Font.

8. Select the formats you want to apply to the text, and then click OK.

9. Click the Find Next, Replace, or Replace All button.

Method 2: Use the Formatting Toolbar Buttons
--------------------------------------------

Use the Formatting toolbar buttons and the Find and Replace dialog boxes. To do
this, follow these steps:

1. On the Edit menu, click Replace.

2. Delete any existing text from the "Find what" and "Replace with" boxes.

3. Click in the "Find what" box.

4. Click the Bold, Italic, or Underline button on the Formatting toolbar.

   Your choice appears next to the word "Format" in the Replace dialog box.

5. Click the button again to move through these formatting choices. For example,
   when you click the Bold button, Format: Bold appears in the dialog box. When
   you click the Bold button again, this changes to Format: Not Bold. When you
   click the Bold button a third time, the Format option disappears.

6. Click in the "Replace with" box.

7. Repeat step 4 to select the format you want to apply.

8. Click the Find Next, Replace, or Replace All button.

Method 3: Use Key Combinations in the Find and Replace Dialog Boxes
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This method applies to Windows only. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Edit menu, click Replace.

2. Delete any existing text from the "Find what" and "Replace with" boxes.

3. Click in the "Find what" box.

4. Press key combinations such as CTRL+U, CTRL+I, or CTRL+B to move through
   underline, italic, or bold formatting choices. Each time you press the key
   combination, the format changes. When you select an existing format, such as
   Bold, it changes to its opposite (Not Bold). Selecting it again clears the
   option completely.

5. Click in the "Replace with" box.

6. Repeat step 4 to select the format you want to apply.

7. Click the Find Next, Replace, or Replace All button.

Bold, italic, and underline formats are toggles. In other words, these formats
can be turned on or turned off. When you replace these formats with another type
of format, you apply a new, additional format to your text.
