TITLE   :XADM: Premature MTA Fanout Inside a Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Inside a multi-server site, a server may send multiple copies of a message to
the bridgehead server. This may occur in the case of a multi-recipient message
and a multi-connector bridgehead server: recipients being served by a different
connector.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

   Component: Message Transfer Agent (MTA)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Only one copy of such a message should be relayed inside the site until the
message reaches the bridgehead server. It is then the bridgehead server's role
to make copies for the different connectors.
