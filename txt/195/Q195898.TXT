SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply the updated Atapi.sys driver on a computer with a hard disk
drive larger than 8 gigabytes (GB) that is connected to a Promise Technologies
Ultra 33 PCI bus-mastering controller, the drive may still be reported as only 8
GB by Disk Administrator.

CAUSE

On computers configured to use a Promise Technologies Ultra 33 PCI bus-
mastering controller, the following conditions must be true:

 - Version 1.3.5 or later of the Promise Technologies driver must be used.

 - The updated Atapi.sys hotfix must be installed.

 - The IDE channel must be disabled in the computer's BIOS so that the LBA EIDE
   feature in the BIOS on the Promise card can control access to the drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

To see a hard disk drive that is larger than 8 GB and is connected to a Promise
Technologies Ultra DMA PCI controller, the following conditions must be true:

 - The IDE channel to which the drive would otherwise be attached on the
   motherboard must be disabled in the computer's BIOS.

 - Use the latest driver for the Promise Technologies Ultra DMA bus- mastering
   card. For the entire drive to be accessible under Windows NT 4.0, version
   1.3.5 or later of this driver must be installed.

   in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
