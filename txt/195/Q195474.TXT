-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you need to know all of the files needed to distribute for RDO to work
successfully on a machine that does not have Visual Basic installed, you can
determine this by using the Dependency file generated by the Setup Wizard. ODBC
must already be on the machine where RDO is being installed.

Another option is to use the Dependency Walker that comes with the Platform SDK.
This shows all of the files a particular DLL depends upon in a graphical format.
It can be obtained at:

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps will generate a dependency file showing the files needed for
RDO:

1. Create a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a reference to "Microsoft Remote Data Object 2.0."

3. Save this project and run the Application Setup Wizard on it.

4. Select "Generate Dependency File" in the Setup Wizard.

5. Once the setup files are created. run the Setup.exe.

6. You will then have a file with a .DEP extension that can be opened with
   Notepad. MSRDO20.DLL will be shown in this file and the files it uses are
   also shown (RDOCURS.DLL, COMCAT.DLL, and ODBC32.DLL).
