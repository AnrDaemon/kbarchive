TITLE   :Virtual Globe 99: "Disputed" Is Repeated in Dynamic Sensor Tool
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbui kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe 99, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view a disputed area such as the Falkland Islands or the Western Sahara
in Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe 99, the word "Disputed" appears twice inside
the Dynamic Sensor tool, as in the following example:

   Falkland Islands (disputed) (Disputed)

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Dynamic Sensor tool is designed to append
the text (Disputed) to the name of a disputed area when you move the pointer
over the disputed area.

Because the text (disputed) is also appended to the name of a disputed area on
the map to avoid the appearance of taking sides in a territorial conflict, the
word "Disputed" is repeated inside the Dynamic Sensor tool when you move the
pointer over a disputed area.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe
99, version 1.0.
