TITLE   :Client Logon Fails When Password Change Required in User Mngr
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Windows 95 client may report a logon failure if the "User Must Change
Password At Next Logon" check box is selected on the User Record, and the SNA
client's sponsor connection is active.

This only occurs with the SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 1 client for Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA client for Windows 95 retries the sponsor connection after successfully
processing the password change but fails because the service table entries and
the cached index are not synchronized.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0 SP1. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
