TITLE   :SNA Server Sends an Incorrect Sequence Number in BIND Response

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A previously functioning logical unit (LU) may remain pending even if no one
else is using it at the moment. On the host, this LU is shown as active.

CAUSE
=====

If an SNA Server sends an OPEN PLU Request to an application, it may send a BIND
-RSP with an incorrect sequence number to the host if it receives a lost
locality from the dynamic address module (DMOD) indicating that the application
has unexpectedly terminated, or that the network connection to the client
running the application has been lost.

The host ignores this response and keeps the LU active, waiting for the correct
BIND response and thus preventing this LU from being used.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack



SNA Server 4.0
--------------

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
3.0, 3.0 Service Pack 1, 3.0 Service Pack 2, 3.0 Service Pack 3, 4.0, and 4.0
Service Pack 1. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack
4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If SNA Server Data Link Control (DLC) and 3270 message tracing is enabled, the
resulting trace may appear as follows:

A BIND request arrives from the host:

In this situation, the application connection was broken, or the application
itself was ended for some reason. This results in a Lost Locality to the SNA
Server's Node.

Because SNA Server knows that a BIND RSP is outstanding, it must generate and
send a -VE BIND RSP to the host.

But instead of sending the response with sequence number 9586 as seen in the
request's transmission header, SNA Server sends the response with an incorrectly
calculated sequence number of 11FC.

Because the host gets a bad sequence number on the BIND RSP, it ignores the
response, and continues to wait for a BIND RSP on that LU with the correct
sequence number, stopping everyone else from using this LU.
