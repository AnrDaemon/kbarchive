MORE INFORMATION
================

This update adds support for the ACTIVATE_SESSION and DEACTIVATE_SESSION APPC
verbs to the SNA Server's 32-bit APPC library. Therefore, these verbs are
supported on SNA Server systems, SNA Server Client for Windows NT systems, and
SNA Server Client for Windows 9x systems.

ACTIVATE_SESSION: Requests SNA Server to activate a session between the Local
APPC LU and a specified Partner APPC LU, using a specified APPC Mode. This verb
completes either when the specified session has become active or when it has
failed.

DEACTIVATE_SESSION: Requests SNA Server to deactivate a particular APPC session
or all APPC sessions on a particular APPC Mode.

Please refer to the updated APPC Programmer's Guide in the SNA Server SDK for
complete details on these verbs.
