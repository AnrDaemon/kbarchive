SUMMARY
=======

On page 325 of the "Microsoft Excel 97 Developer's Kit", the documentation for
the LABEL record is incomplete and misleading. This article contains the
clarification of that documentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The documentation on page 325 shows the structure of a LABEL record to be the
following:

   Offset     Name     Size     Contents
   -------------------------------------

    4        rw        2         Row
    6        col       2         Column
    8        ixfe      2         Index to the XF Record
    10       cch       2         Length of the string
    12       rgch      var       The string

This implies that the structure of strings in LABEL records differs from that of
other strings in BIFF files. The correct format for LABEL records, shown below,
brings them into compliance with the string format for BIFF files, as described
on page 264 of the "Microsoft Excel 97 Developer's Kit".

   Offset     Name     Size     Contents
   -------------------------------------

    4        rw        2         Row
    6        col       2         Column
    8        ixfe      2         Index to the XF Record
    10       cch       2         Length of the string
    12       grbit     1         Option flags (described on page 264)
    13       rgb       var       Array of string characters
