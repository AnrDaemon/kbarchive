SUMMARY

This article contains comments, corrections, and information about known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book Programming Active Server Pages, ISBN
1-57231-700-0.

The following topics are covered:

 - Page 38: Complete Object Reference Not Included On CD-ROM

 - Page 112-115: Code Correction

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 38: Complete Object Reference Not Included On CD-ROM
---------------------------------------------------------

On page 38, in the 4th paragraph, change the last sentence to reference Appendix
D.

Change:
"A complete object reference is also included on the CD-ROM that accompanies this
book."

To:
"For a complete object reference refer to Appendix D."


Page 112-115: Code Correction
-----------------------------

There is a paging recordset example on page 112-115 and in the code you specify
the pagesize as 10. This creates a problem if you end up with a recordcount not
divisible by 10.

Add the following code to resolve the issue:

   <%
   If CLng(Session("CurrentPage")) = ObjRecordset.PageCount Then

       'how many records are here

       If ObjRecordset.RecordCount < 10 Then

           ObjRecordset.PageSize = ObjRecordset.RecordCount

       Else

           'we do some maths

           counted = ((ObjRecordset.Pagecount - 1)*10)

           ObjRecordSet.PageSize = ObjRecordset.RecordCount - Clng(counted)

       End If

   End If
