SUMMARY
=======

For security reasons, Web administrators may want to disable the #exec function
of Server Side Include (SSI) files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the Microsoft
Internet Information Server (IIS) metabase. Before you edit the metabase, make
sure you understand how to restore it if a problem occurs. For information about
how to do this, view the "Configuration Backup/Restore" Help topic in the
Internet Information Server snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

Internet Information Server (IIS) versions 3.0 and later allow command- line or
CGI programs to be executed, and their text output to be returned as Web output.
This is accomplished through the use of Server-Side Include (SSI) commands. An
example of this type of command is as follows:

      <html>
      <html><title>SSI #exec Test</title></head>
      <body>
      <pre>
      <!--#exec cmd="cmd.exe /c dir"-->
      </pre>
      </body>
      </html>

This functionality is enabled by default for the entire Web server. Web
administrators may want to disable this feature. This is accomplished by
performing the following steps:

1. On an IIS 4.0 computer with the Windows Script Host (WSH) installed, go to
   the following directory:

   <%SystemRoot%>\System32\Inetsrv\adminsamples

2. To disable #exec for the entire Web server use the following:

   cscript adsutil.vbs set w3svc/SSIExecDisable 1

   -OR-

   For a specific virtual directory, you can use the following:

   cscript adsutil.vbs set w3svc/xx/root/vv/SSIExecDisable 1

   Where xx = the instance of the Web server and vv = the virtual directory name.

NOTE: This will not effect the #include command.
