TITLE   :WD97: "Converter Is an Old Version" Error Trying to Convert
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to convert a file, the following error message appears:

   The selected text converter is an old version which does not work with the
   current version of Word. Reinstall the converter and try again.

CAUSE
=====

This error may be caused when Microsoft FrontPage 98 is installed on a computer
that already contains a "Run From Network Server" installation of Word.

If you have installed Microsoft Word 97 (not including Word 97 Service Release 1)
as a "Run From Network Server" workstation installation and then you install
FrontPage 98 locally, FrontPage 98 detects the administrative installation of
Word on the network server and replaces the Word converters. FrontPage 98
installs the SR-1 version of all the converters.

Word 97 (not including Word 97 SR-1) is unable to use this version of the
converters, which results in the error message described in the "Symptoms"
section of this article.

NOTE: If Word is installed locally or if its shared files are installed locally,
this problem does not occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Perform a custom installation of FrontPage 98 and do not install the shared
   converters.

   -or-

 - Install Microsoft Word 97 SR-1.

This behavior does not occur in Microsoft Word 2000.
