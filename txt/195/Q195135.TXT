SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open a master document, the following error message appears:

   The subdocument c:\<foldername>\<file name> is missing. Do you
   want to expand the master document without this subdocument?

If you click No, Word cancels the operation and does not open the master
document. If you click Yes, Word opens the master document without the missing
subdocument. You can then use the Insert Subdocument button on the Master
Document toolbar to locate and reinsert the missing subdocument.

CAUSE
=====

Word cannot find the subdocument if you move it to a different location relative
to the master document, if the subdocument is located on a network drive that is
no longer valid, or if you delete the subdocument file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you want to move subdocuments to a new location relative to the master
document, refer to the instructions in the "Rename a subdocument" topic in Word
Help.

When you move a master document, Word automatically searches for the subdocuments
in a manner that is relative to the master document. This feature, which is by
design, makes it easy for you to move an entire master document directory tree
while preserving the subdocument references.

When you open a master document, Word searches for the subdocuments relative to
the master document. In other words, if the subdocuments are in a subdirectory
of the master document directory, Word looks for the subdocuments in the same
subdirectory of the new master document location. The following table
illustrates this search pattern.

                  If the former               Then Word automatically
                  location is:                searches here:
                  ---------------------------------------------------

   Master         C:\WORD 97\MASTER          F:\CATALOG\1993
   Subdocuments   C:\WORD 97\MASTER\SUBDOCS  F:\CATALOG\1993\SUBDOCS

                                               -then-

                                              C:\WORD 97\MASTER\SUBDOCS

If Word cannot find the subdocuments in the relative location, it searches in the
original subdocument location (in this case, C:\WORD 97\MASTER\SUBDOCS). If Word
still cannot find the subdocument, the "The subdocument is missing..." error
message appears.
