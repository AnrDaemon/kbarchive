SUMMARY

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using an EQ Field
-----------------

To put a box around an individual letter, word, or combination of words, use the
{eq} field with the \x switch, as in the following example:

   {eq \x(b) \x(o) \x(x)}

This field will create a result that resembles the following:

   ----- ----- -----
   | b | | o | | x |
   ----- ----- -----

This field {eq \x(box)} will create a result similar to this:

   -------
   | box |
   -------

To insert an empty field in Word, press CTRL+F9.

For more information about the EQ field, click the Office Assistant, type "What
is an EQ field" (without the quotation marks), click Search, and then click to
view "Field codes: Eq (Equation) field."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Word Help is not installed on your computer, please see the

version of Word.

With the insertion point still in the paragraph with the field, click Borders And
Shading on the Format menu, select the Borders tab, and select the Box preset.
