TITLE   :Excel Files for Macintosh Locked by Index Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Index Server, any Microsoft Excel documents for Macintosh that are
being indexed are locked by the index process. You cannot modify or delete the
files.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Office filter in Index Server is unable to index Microsoft Excel
documents formatted for Macintosh. Index Server opens the documents with the
Office filter, but does not index them and never closes the document.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

Installing Excel 97 for Windows on the Index Server computer allows the
documents to be filtered correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0
and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 updates the Office filter for Index Server so that
the files will not be left open.
