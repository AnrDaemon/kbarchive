TITLE   :INFO: Visual SourceSafe Creates a VSSVer.scc File
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe600 kbSSExplorer

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual SourceSafe operations that copy files from the Visual SourceSafe database
to another location, such as a project's working folder, shadow folder, or
deploy location create a file named VSSVer.scc.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual SourceSafe 6.0 uses the VSSVer.scc to speed up the GET process (Fast GET)
on any database, even one that is not in the new format supported by Visual
SourceSafe 6.0. There is no way to prevent Visual SourceSafe from creating this
file when performing an explicit or implicit GET operation. Setting the file's
Hidden attribute, however, does not affect performance and can be used to
prevent the file from appearing in Windows Explorer.
