IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When running an application with the Btrieve engine version 6.15 under Windows
NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3 and NWLink IPX/SPX protocol, you may receive the
following Event error consistently:

   Event ID 2012 - The Server Has Encountered a Network Error.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serous problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

NOTE: Registry keys in the following procedure may appear on two or more lines,
but are actually one path; they have been wrapped for readability.

Change the IPX MaxPktSize from 240 to 0 via the Registry.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

   NOTE: It is recommended that you first save each registry key before deleting
   it.

2. The MaxPktSize information is located in the following registry keys:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NWLnkIPX
\NetConfig\<adapter name>


3. Double-click MaxPktSize and change from 240 to 0.

If changing the MaxPktSize alone does not correct the problem, contact Microsoft
Product Support Services and get the most recent Nwlnkspx.sys and MUP.SYS files.
