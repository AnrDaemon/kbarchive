TITLE   :BUG: Error C2065: 'DDX_FieldDateTimeCtrl': Undeclared Identifier
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbVC600bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Date Time Picker Control in a Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 AppWizard
(exe) Database project, you may receive the following error:

   Compiler Error "Error C2065: 'DDX_FieldDateTimeCtrl' : undeclared identifier"

CAUSE
=====

The database dialog data exchange cover routine generated by the Microsoft
Visual C++ 6.0 AppWizard for exchanging data between the Date Time Picker
control and the recordset member variable is DDX_FieldDateTimeCtrl( ). This
function is omitted from the Visual C++ 6.0 release code.

RESOLUTION
==========

Replace the database dialog data exchange cover routine DDX_FieldDateTimeCtrl( )
with the AFXAPI DDX_DateTimeCtrl( ). Remove the fourth parameter in the
DDX_DateTimeCtrl() call.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a table with a Date/Time field.

2. Create a Data Source to access the table.

3. In Visual C++ 6.0, create an MFC AppWizard(exe) project to access the table
   created in step 1 using the DSN created in step 2.

4. Add a Data Time Picker Control to the dialog box and associate it with the
   Date/Time field in the table.

5. Compile the project.

RESULTS: This generates the following compiler error:

   error C2065: 'DDX_FieldDateTimeCtrl' : undeclared identifier
