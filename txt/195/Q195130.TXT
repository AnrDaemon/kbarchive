The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The Word Processing module in LotusWorks versions 1.0 and 3.0 supports import
and export of ASCII text only. Therefore, if you want to use information from a
LotusWorks word processing document in Word 97 for Windows, you must export it
as ASCII text and open it in Word as Text Only or MS-DOS Text Only.

The LotusWorks spreadsheet module saves spreadsheets in Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x
WK1 format by default. You can open WK1 format files directly into Word 97 for
Windows (provided you have installed the Lotus 1-2-3 converter), and you can
link WK1 files into a Word for MS-DOS document in the same manner as any Lotus
1-2-3 file.
