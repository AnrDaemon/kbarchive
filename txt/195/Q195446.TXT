SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 System Preparation tool prepares the preinstalled
hard-disk contents of a Windows NT 4.0-based computer (referred to here as the
"source computer") for imaging and subsequent transfer to other computers
(referred to here as "destination computers"). The System Preparation tool
prepares the source Windows NT 4.0 computer image to run a mini-setup wizard and
regenerate a system security identifier (SID). The result is a source computer
system configuration that you can copy to another identically configured
computer through the use of disk image copying tools. The mini-setup wizard
configures some of the computer-specific or user-specific settings, including
user name, organization, product key, computer name, and administrator password.
When the destination computer is started, the SID is regenerated, which ensures
that each system SID is unique and the mini-setup wizard is run. Note that most
of the mini-setup wizard can be scripted to automate the process, which
minimizes setup technician time.

How to Obtain the New Windows Deployment Tools
----------------------------------------------

The Windows NT 4.0 Sysprep tool is available from the following Microsoft Web
site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/technicalresources/deployment/DeploymentDocs/deploy/DeployTools/SysPrep.asp

NOTE: These tools do not copy the image, they "prepare" a system to be copied
through the use of a third-party tool. Microsoft currently has no plans to
develop a disk image copying tool.
