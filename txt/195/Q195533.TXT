TITLE   :INFO: Application Object Protected in Custom VFP COM Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

KEYWORDS:kbCOMt kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The application object in Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 6.0 custom COM servers
is protected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Visual FoxPro 5.0, the application object was exposed by default in all
custom COM servers. In Visual FoxPro 6.0, the application object is now
"protected," so that it cannot be accessed outside a particular instance of the
object.

To show this, build the following code into a Visual FoxPro COM .exe:

Sample Code
-----------

      **********Server Code*******************
      DEFINE CLASS Test1 AS CUSTOM OLEPUBLIC

         PROCEDURE retapp
            RETURN THIS.APPLICATION
         ENDPROC
         PROCEDURE retapp2
            RETURN _VFP.APPLICATION
         ENDPROC
      ENDDEFINE
      **********End Server Code***************

      **********Begin Client Code************
      oX=CREATEOBJECT("SERVTEST.TEST1")
      oY=oX.retapp &&Works
      oZ=oX.retapp2 &&Works
      ?oY.Name
      ?oZ.Name
      ?oX.Application.Name &&Errors Occur
      *********End Client Code***************

The first two references work because they access the application object from
within the instance of the object through a method and return the result to the
client.

The last reference "oX.Application.Name" tries to reference the Application
object directly from the client. This returns the following error message:

   OLE error code 0x80020006: Unknown name
