TITLE   :SMS: Pkg. Distribution Fails If Updating of Master Pkg. Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2

SYMPTOMS
========

When Despooler fails to update the stored master copy of a package, it creates a
"retry" instruction for the job. However, the retry does not refresh existing
distribution servers even though the original job specified that existing
distribution servers be refreshed.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Systems
Management Server service pack that contains this fix.
