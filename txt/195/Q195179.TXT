TITLE   :Cannot Disable HTTP KeepAlives for HTTP/1.1 Clients
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

HTTP/1.1 client connections are not closed, even if the Allow HTTP KeepAlives
check box is not selected in the Web site's properties in Microsoft Management
Console (MMC).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Allow HTTP KeepAlives check box applies only to
HTTP/1.0 clients that connect to the IIS server.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Section 8.1.2.1 Negotiation" section of RFC2068 states the following:

   In case the client does not want to maintain a connection for more than
   that request, it SHOULD send a Connection header including the
   connection-token close.

Sections 8.1.2.1 and 19.7.1 both discuss backwards compatibility for previous
HTTP versions and state that persistent connections must be explicitly
negotiated.

The AllowKeepAlives feature is only valid in the following scenarios:

If you clear the Allow HTTP KeepAlives check box on the server and use an
HTTP/1.0 client that tries to establish a persistent connection, the server
sends a close.

If you select the Allow HTTP KeepAlives check box on the server and use an
HTTP/1.0 client that tries to establish a persistent connection, the server
honors the request for persistence.
