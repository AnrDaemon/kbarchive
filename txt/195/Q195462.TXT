SUMMARY
=======

This article details WINS registration and IP address behavior for Microsoft
Cluster Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During the installation of Microsoft Cluster Server, network names are required
for each adapter. This "network name" is a label used to differentiate which
group of adapters should be created on which IP Address. This IP Address then
inherits the TCP/IP properties of the adapter bound to this network on the
active node. NetBIOS names are registered based on dependencies for that NetBIOS
name.

Example:

Criteria: Node X and Node Y both are dual-homed computers with one network
interface card (NIC) used for client and internal communications and a dedicated
NIC for internal use only. The client adapters are assigned the network name
Corpnet. For clarity, only the client side adapters will be discussed in this
example. Private adapters should not register with WINS.

   Adapter on Node X registers with WINS Server A Adapter on Node Y registers
   with WINS Server B

IP Address 10.1.1.1 is registered with Microsoft Cluster Server as a virtual IP
Address NetBIOS Name WOLFPACK depends on 10.1.1.1

Whichever node owns the group that the IP address and network name are in will
register the NetBIOS Name Wolfpack with the WINS server associated with its IP
address when the NetBIOS name is brought online. That is, if Node X owns the
group WOLFPACK on 10.1.1.1, it will register with WINS Server A. If Node Y owns
the group, it will register on WINS Server B. This could have potential name
resolution issues. For ease of use, adapters with client side access should
point to the same WINS servers.
