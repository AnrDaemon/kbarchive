-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The height of a text box changes when you paste into it an image from the
Clipboard (such as a ClipArt image or a Microsoft Excel chart).

CAUSE
=====

When you paste an image from the Clipboard into an empty text box or callout,
Word adjusts the height of the text box to match the proportions of the
Clipboard image, while maintaining the text box width.

However, if the text box or callout contains text, the box does not resize.
Instead, Word attempts to maintain the image's size. This may result in the
picture not appearing until you resize the box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To maintain the size of the image, be sure that the text box or callout is large
enough for the image, and then type text in the box. If the box contains text
(such as spaces), Word does not resize the image when it pastes it in the box.
