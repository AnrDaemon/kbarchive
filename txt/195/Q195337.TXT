TITLE   :MSN: E-mail Notification Temporarily Disabled
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbtool kbmsn

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Quick View utility in MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may
receive the following message:

   E-mail Notification Temporarily Disabled

NOTE: This notification does not prevent you from accessing your MSN e-mail
account.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for any of the following reasons:

 - The MSN e-mail servers are not working properly.

 - The MSN Mail account is missing or not configured properly in Microsoft
   Outlook Express.

 - The MSN Mail account is not using the MSN Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)
   e-mail servers.

 - The MSN Online Setup program did not complete successfully.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can determine if the MSN e-mail servers are not working properly by waiting
until a later time and then using the Quick View utility in MSN again. If you no
longer receive this message, the MSN e-mail servers are now working properly
(but were not working properly earlier).

If the issue continues to occur, follow these steps:

1. Start Outlook Express.

2. If the MSN Sign-In screen is displayed, click Cancel.

3. On the Tools menu, click Accounts.

4. On the Mail tab, click the MSN Mail account, and then click Remove.

5. Quit Outlook Express.

6. Click Start, and then click Run.

7. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK:

   http://setup.msn.com/membersonly/config/default.asp

8. When you are prompted to connect to MSN, do so, and then follow the
   instructions on the screen to configure your MSN e-mail account.
