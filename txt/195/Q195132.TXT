TITLE   :WD97: {EQ \X()} Field Converts to {EMBED EQUATION.2} Field
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click an equation formula that applies a box around your text,
the field result changes so that your text is no longer surrounded by a box. In
some cases, the spaces between the words are removed.

For example, the following field places a box around the word test:

   {EQ \X(test)}

If you double-click this field, the border around test is removed.

CAUSE
=====

The {EQ} field is converted to an embedded Equation Editor object when you
double-click it. To confirm this, toggle field codes view on. You will see a
field similar to this:

   {EMBED EQUATION.2}

   -or-

   {EMBED EQUATION.3}

An {EQ} field is linked to Equation Editor and cannot be unlinked. Equation
Editor does not have a feature to draw a box around selected text and cannot
reproduce the same results as the {EQ} field.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - If you double-clicked the {EQ} field, you can immediately click the Undo
   button on the Standard toolbar to reverse this change. If the Undo stack has
   been refreshed, delete the {Embed.Equation.2} field and reinsert the {EQ}
   field.

   -or-

 - When placing borders around words, use the Border feature of Word rather than
   using an EQ field. To do this, follow these steps:

   1. Select the word you want to place a box around.

   2. On the Format menu, click Borders and Shading, and select the Borders tab.

   3. Under Setting, click a format for your box. Under Apply To, select Text.

   4. Click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed
above.
