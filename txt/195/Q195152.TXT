SUMMARY
=======

There are additional tasks that Exchange Server client and Schedule+ users must
perform to complete a server move.

 - After the server move and before using your Exchange Server client or
   Schedule+, delete the .ost and .scd files from your directory.

 - Create a new user profile for your Exchange Server client mailbox using the
   Control Panel Mail tool.

 - Create a new .ost file for your Exchange Server client. If you plan to work
   offline with Exchange Server, you will need an .ost file for your mailbox. In
   your Exchange Server client, from the Tools menu, click Services, then click
   Microsoft Exchange Server. Click Properties and on the Advanced tab, click
   Offline Folder File Settings, and then specify a location for your .ost file.

 - Specify the folders to be synchronized with your .ost. For each folder in
   your Inbox that you want synchronized with your .ost, right-click on the
   folder and click Properties. On the Synchronization tab, select when you want
   synchronization to occur.

 - Choose to create a new schedule file. The first time you use Schedule+ after
   the move, you can create a new schedule file. Choose either I want to create
   a new schedule file, or I do not want a schedule file on this machine. Do not
   use an old version of a schedule file. Old versions of schedule files might
   not synchronize properly with the server and can cause synchronization error
   messages and appointments to be removed from your calendar.
