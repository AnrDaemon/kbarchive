TITLE   :XADM: Deadlock in STORE Due to a Stack Overflow
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange information store may stop responding (hang) because of a
stack overflow when processing a corrupted message. After this happens, the
client cannot log on to the Exchange Server computer and cannot send or receive
a message.

CAUSE
=====

This happens because the message contains a corrupted attachment, in this case,
there is no "END" section for the encoded attachment. When the information store
encounters an incomplete sequence at the end of the encoded line, it keeps
appending more data, but makes no progress with decoding.

RESOLUTION
==========

Exchange Server 5.5
-------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
