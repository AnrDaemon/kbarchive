TITLE   :XCLN: Windows NT Change Password Button Is Enabled with DPA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:; winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Outlook 98, you may be prompted for your logon credentials. The
Logon dialog box has a Change Password button to allow the user to change their
Windows NT password. If the selected profile is configured to use DPA
(Distributed Password Authentication), the Change Password button will allow a
user to modify the Windows NT password, even though they are not using Windows
NT for authentication. This can cause confusion for the novice user.

CAUSE
=====

The routine that displays the Logon dialog box is not aware of the various
authentication packages.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.
