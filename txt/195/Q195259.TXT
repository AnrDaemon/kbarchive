TITLE   :FTP Site Mapped to a Remote Share May Have Access Problems
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After creating a virtual directory for FTP access that points to a remote
Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path, you may have a problem performing a GET
request. You may receive an Access Denied message, even though the account used
to connect has read and write access.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, grant permissions to the UNC path for the Windows
NT account that is used for anonymous access to the FTP site (typically the
IUSR_<computer_name> account).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 4.0.
