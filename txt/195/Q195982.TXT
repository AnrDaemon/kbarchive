SUMMARY
=======

When using the DataEnvironment in Visual Basic 6.0, it is not possible to set
the prompting behavior at design-time. This property is set to adPromptComplete
by default. You might want to change this property so that a prompt is not
displayed when establishing a connection to a database. To do this you must set
the "Prompt" property of the DataEnvironment at run-time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The prompt property of the DataEnvironment can be set using the following
syntax:

   DataEnvironment.Connection1.Properties("Prompt") = adPromptNever

There are four possible values to specify here:

 - adPromptAlways (1)
 - adPromptComplete (2)
 - adPromptCompleteRequired (3)
 - adPromptNever (4)

Following are the steps to create a Visual Basic project that illustrates how to
use this property:

1. Create a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a CommandButton to the default form.

3. Add a DataEnvironment to the project.

4. From the DataEnvironment window, right-mouse click on Connection1 and select
   Properties.

5. Select the Microsoft OLEDB Provider for ODBC Drivers. Click Next and
   configure the second tab so that the connection will point to a valid
   Database using either an existing DSN or a connection string.

6. Add the following code to the default form:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
           Debug.Print DataEnvironment1.Connection1.Properties("Prompt")
           DataEnvironment1.Connection1.Open
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Load()
         DataEnvironment1.Connection1.Properties("Prompt") = adPromptAlways.
         '  Uncomment this line to suppress the prompt dialog:
         '  DataEnvironment1.Connection1.Properties("Prompt") = adPromptNever.
         End Sub

7. Run the project and click the CommandButton. Note that a prompt is displayed
   when you try to connect to the database. Uncomment the line of code in the
   Form_Load() event that sets the prompt to adPromptNever and comment out the
   code that sets the prompt property to adPromptAlways. Run the code again and
   note that this time no prompt is displayed.
