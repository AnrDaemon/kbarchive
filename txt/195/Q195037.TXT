SUMMARY
=======

The application event log of Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 may contain
frequent occurrences of the following event:

   Event ID: 11214
   Source: MSExchange NNTP
   Category: Client Action
   Description:
   An unexpected error occurred while handling an NNTP protocol command.
   Error 0x80070005 was returned by procedure EcNNTPPost while executing
   procedure EcSaveNntpArticle.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This event may occur if a user is connected to the Exchange Server NNTP host as
an anonymous user, and attempts to post to a newsgroup root folder, or one of
its subfolders, when an anonymous user does not have the appropriate rights for
the folder.

To allow clients to post anonymously to Exchange Server public folders using
NNTP, the following steps must be taken:

1. In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, confirm that
   anonymous access has been enabled at the site level by selecting the Protocol
   container.

2. On the File menu, select "NNTP (News) Site Defaults," then select Properties.

3. On the Anonymous tab, select the "Allow anonymous access" check box, and
   click OK.

4. Then check that the anonymous user category has been granted the appropriate
   permissions. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, select the
   newsgroup folder in question, and on the File menu, click Properties.

5. Click the General tab, and then click Client Permissions.

6. In the list of users and permissions, ensure that the anonymous user category
   has the correct permissions. Confirm that the default role, "Nonediting
   Author," is set for anonymous users.

NOTE: The permission "Nonediting Author" for the anonymous user category should
also be assigned for the subfolders under the Internet Newsgroup root folder so
anonymous users can post to them as well.
