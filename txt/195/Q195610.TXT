TITLE   :WD97: After Update Excel Object Not a Paste Special Option
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Excel as an OLE server application, in some cases, you
will be unable to paste an Excel object into Word using the Paste or Paste
Special commands on the Edit menu. If you click Paste Special, the Source field
in the Paste Special dialog box will specify that the source is unknown.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Excel object is no longer in the Clipboard.

When you run Excel as an OLE server application with Word, after you update the
embedded Excel object and return to Word, the Excel object disappears from the
Clipboard.

WORKAROUND
==========

To use the Paste Special command to embed an Excel object in your Word document
as many times as you want, follow these steps:

1. Start Excel independent of Word (do not run it as a server application).

2. Copy the Excel selection you want to appear in your Word document (do not
   quit Excel).

3. Start Word.

4. On the Edit menu, click Paste Special.

Note that the Excel object remains an available option in the Paste Special
dialog box until you quit Excel or replace the contents of the Clipboard with
something else.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you embed an Excel worksheet object in Word by choosing Object from the
Insert menu and selecting one of the Excel object options (or if you edit an
already embedded Excel object), you activate an Excel server session. To quit
the Excel server session and return to the Word document, click Update on the
File menu and then click Exit. When you quit Excel, the Excel object in the
Clipboard is deleted from the Clipboard. Because the Clipboard no longer
contains the Excel object, the Excel Object options are not available in Paste
Special.
