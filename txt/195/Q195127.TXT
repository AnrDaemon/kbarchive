TITLE   :WD97: Converter Not Automatically Installed in Word
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Word 97, if you have already opened a file during the current session, you
cannot auto-install a file converter.

CAUSE
=====

Word 97 only searches for and auto-installs converters the first time you open a
file in a Word session.

WORKAROUND
==========

Auto-Installing the Converter
-----------------------------

To auto-install the converter, follow these steps:

1. Copy the converter to the appropriate directory or folder.

   Place the converter in the same directory as the Winword.exe file or the
   \Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv directory.

2. Save your work, quit Word, and restart Word.

3. Open any document that Word cannot recognize (for example, a document of the
   format supported by the converter, a program file, or a clipart graphics
   file).

Word will find and install the converter, and it will henceforth appear as a
choice in the Open and Save As dialog boxes.
