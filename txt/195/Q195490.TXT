TITLE   :XADM: Deleted Items not Moved After a Move Mailbox
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A feature of Exchange Server 5.5 is Deleted Items Retention. Users who delete
their messages can recover those deleted items during the Deleted Item Retention
time window set by an Exchange Server administrator.

When a user is moved from one server within a site to another using the Move
Mailbox function of the Exchange Server Administrator program, all of the user's
Inbox data is moved with the exception of the Deleted Items.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a user deletes a message from his or her Deleted Items folder, and Deleted
Item Retention is turned on, the message will be 'soft deleted.' This means that
it is basically hidden, but still resides in the user's server mailbox until the
retention period is up.

When a mailbox is moved using the Exchange Server Administrator program, the
retained Deleted Items cannot be moved, and are simply 'hard-deleted' during the
next Exchange Server information store maintenance period.

It is recommended that Exchange Server administrators who use this feature send a
note to their users prior to moving a mailbox so that users can look at the
retained deleted items, and recover anything they feel they may want. Some users
may choose to recover all the retained items, go through the move, and then
delete them again after they are on the new server. This method will result in
no loss of functionality.
