SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the InnocuLAN Real Time Monitor on Exchange Server computers, the
Exchange Server stores may become corrupt.

WORKAROUND
==========

To stop the InnocuLAN Real Time Monitor from monitoring the Exchange Server
services, perform the following steps:

1. Make sure that Ino_fltr.sys is dated later than February 12, 1998. This is an
   InnocuLAN file.

2. Find out the processes image names from Windows NT Task Manager. Locate the
   following processes:

   Microsoft Exchange server:

   Store.exe
   Mad.exe
   Dsamain.exe
   Emsmta.exe

   If the Internet Mail Service is installed:

   Msexcimc.exe

   If the MS Mail connector is installed:

   Dxa.exe
   Async.exe
   Mt.ext

   If key management server is installed:

   Kmserver.exe

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Cheyenne\InnocuLAN\CurrentVersion\Filter

3. On the Edit menu, click Add New Value, and type the following:

   REG_MULTI_SZ called xProcess

4. Type the process image names that you want to exclude from InocuLAN
   protection in the MultiString Editor Box (put a carriage return/line feed
   between each process).

NOTE: You must enter the Multi-String data as follows:

   a. Include the .exe extension for the image name.

   b. Image names must be typed in upper case.

   c. Dsamain.exe and Store.exe must be included in the list.

5. Restart the computer running Windows NT to load the excluded information into
   the driver.
