TITLE   :XADM: Missing Address Template Causes Event 1188
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the regional settings within Windows NT are set to a template that does not
exist in Exchange Server, an Event Log entry similar to the following will
appear in the Windows NT Application log:

   Event ID:    1188
   Source:      MSExchange IS
   Description:
   The address template or display template for locale
   id 0x1409 could not be found, ignoring.  Please install
   language support for that language by importing the
   appropriate address template from the Microsoft Exchange
   client cdrom.

In the above example, 0x1409 represents the locale for New Zealand. For example,
locale ID 0xC09 represents English/Australia.

CAUSE
=====

This is because Exchange Server has no address template specific to the defined
locales.

Within the English edition of Exchange Server, the server computer will default
back to English/USA as the address template, so there is no functional loss
experienced apart from the Event Log entry as described above.

For more information on locales, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge
Base article:

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, it is possible to modify the standard USA locale
and install this additional template to remove the Event Log entry.

To create an English\New Zealand template, perform the following steps:

1. Copy the entire Server\Setup\I386\Tpl\Usa directory to a temporary directory
   on the local hard drive.

2. Remove the read-only attribute from the file Template.csv, which is located
   in the temporary directory that you just created.

3. Open the Template.csv file in Notepad, and then perform a Search and Replace
   procedure in Notepad to replace the occurrences of "USA" with the text "New
   Zealand."

4. Perform a Search and Replace procedure in Notepad to replace the occurrence
   of 409 (USA) with 1409 (New Zealand) and then save this file as Template.csv
   (The value of the locale can be found in the Description of the Event ID:
   1188 in the Windows NT Application Event logs.)

5. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program and on the Tools menu, click
   Directory Import, click Import File, and then click the Template.CSV file
   that you saved in the temporary directory on the local hard drive.

6. Click Import at the bottom of the Directory Import dialog box.

7. Shut down the server and restart.
