TITLE   :Fiber System Loses SCSI Reservation After Multiple Restarts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A potential problem exists after multiple reboots of a clustered system using a
fiber channel array as the shared storage system. After multiple restarts, the
SCSI reservations may lose a drive array because of repeated SCSI resets.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is because a reservation conflict occurs in the Disk.sys driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

A new file entry solves the problem by enumerating the following information in
Disk.sys STATUS_DEVICE_BUSY (the status that indicates a reservation conflict).

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
