The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Print Service does not preserve Spool File Attributes (like characters
per line and lines per inch) from one print job to the next for AS/400 print
sessions that are not using Host Print Transform.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server Versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, and 4.0 SP1. We are researching this problem in SNA
Server version 3.0 and will post more information here in the Knowledge Base as
it becomes available.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following

MORE INFORMATION
================

If an AS/400 sends SCS control codes that set the Spool File attributes for a
print job, it will not send the SCS control codes for the next print job if they
have the same Spool File attributes.
