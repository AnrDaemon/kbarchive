SUMMARY
=======

It may be necessary under some circumstances to condense a Performance Monitor
log file. This article discusses various ways to accomplish this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are four ways to condense a Performance Monitor log file:

 - Use a file compression program, such as WinZip, to compress the log file.
   Performance Monitor log files compress very well using such utilities. This
   method is useful when you need to retain the entire contents of the log file.

 - Relog the log file after resizing the time window. This method is useful when
   you are interested in only a specific time frame captured within the log
   file. An example of this is when you maintain weekly Performance Monitor
   logs, but are interested in reviewing only one of the days from one of the
   weekly logs. See "Relogging Input Log Files" in Performance Monitor Help for
   more information on relogging a log file with a modified time window.

 - Relog the log file after limiting the number of objects to be logged. This
   method is useful when you are interested in only a specific subset of objects
   collected in a log. An example of this is when you maintain regular complete
   logs (all objects included) but are interested in reviewing only the memory
   usage from a particular log. See "Relogging Input Log Files" in Performance
   Monitor Help for more information on relogging a log file with a reduced
   object set.

 - Relog the log file after increasing the update interval. This method is
   useful when you are interested in overall trends over the log file time
   frame. An example of this is when you maintain regular complete logs at ten
   minute update intervals, but wish to see only hourly samples over a
   particular log's time frame. See "Relogging Input Log Files" in Performance
   Monitor Help for more information on relogging a log file. After you have set
   up to relog a log file, select Log from the Options menu and then increase
   the number found in the Periodic Update Interval field.
