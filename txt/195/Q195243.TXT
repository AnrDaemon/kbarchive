SUMMARY
=======

ASP may misinterpret extra or missing delimiters as HTML. ASP does not interpret
HTML.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You should check for extra or missing delimiters if you receive unusual output.
A missing delimiter may be misinterpreted as HTML. For example, the following
script would be interpreted as HTML:

      <TABLE WIDTH=100%>

Note that the familiar ASP delimiter is contained within this statement
('%>').

An extra delimiter may also be misinterpreted by ASP. For example:

      <%SCRIPT LANGUAGE = "VBScript"%> %>

ASP interprets the above line as "SCRIPT LANGUAGE = "VBSCRIPT"%>" because that
is what is between the delimiters.
