The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the

   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Netscape Navigator 3.x or 4.05 to check e-mail messages on Exchange
Server computers, Navigator is unable to open attachments. When you attempt to
open the attachment, a Save As dialog box appears. Your only option is to save
the file and open it later.

CAUSE
=====

Although Internet Explorer can open attachments properly based on file
extensions, Netscape Navigator requires that the correct content type be
specified. If the server does not have the association of the content type with
an extension in the registry, then Navigator does not get this information. An
example of the association in the registry is .DOC = application/msword.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

For problems with Microsoft Word document attachments, ensure that the following
registry subkey and value exist:

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.doc

   Value Name: Content Type
   Value Data: application/msword

Because the problem is not specific to attachments with the .doc extension, you
need to ensure that other extension types are defined in the following subkey:

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT \<extension type>

After you add the value above, you need to restart your computer. Stopping and
restarting the Exchange Server services and Web services does not work.

Failure to restart results in ASP 0115 errors in the client after the change has
been made in the registry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
