TITLE   :WD97: Excel Object Range Name Changes Format After Paste Link
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta winword word97kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you paste link a Microsoft Excel object into a Word document, the range
name changes to a cell reference (CxRx) format.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you select the range in Excel and use the Copy Picture
command (hold SHIFT and then on the Edit menu, click Copy Picture).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the Copy command instead of the Copy Picture
command in Excel.

NOTE: The disadvantage to using this method is that an embedded chart is not
copied as part of the link. An embedded chart is available only when you use the
Copy Picture command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed
above.

Additional query words: row column format
