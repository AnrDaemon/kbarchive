STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error above occurs if the Primary Domain Controller is using the French
language, whatever the language of Exchange Server.

To install this fix, perform the following steps:

1. Perform a copy-and-paste operation for all the Service Pack 1 files to the
   local hard drive of each cluster node.

2. Perform a copy-and-paste operation for Exupdate.exe to the same directory
   that contains Udpate.exe (this should be i386 on Intel- platform computers).

3. Go to an MS-DOS command prompt and type the following to run Exupdate.exe on
   the first (active) node:

   EXUPDATE

4. Run EXUPDATE (Exupdate.exe) on the second node.

5. Replace the Service Pack 1 Admin.exe in <exchsrvr>\BIN with the new
   fixed Admin.exe.
