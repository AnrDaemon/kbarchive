unnecessary for proper operation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the dynamic link library file named Hpdcmon.dll from
%SystemRoot%\System32 folder. If it is not found in this folder, perform a
search of your %SystemRoot% folder including subfolders, and remove it from any
folder in which it is found.

MORE INFORMATION
