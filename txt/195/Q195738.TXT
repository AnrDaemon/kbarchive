======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0sp3, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0sp3, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When template classes or template class header files are included in a
precompiled header file, the compiler may generate the following error for files
that use the precompiled header:

   fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
   (compiler file 'msc1.cpp', line 1786)

   -or-

   fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
   (compiler file 'msc1.cpp', line 1188)

This error occurs only on machines with the Windows 95 or Windows 98 operating
system.

CAUSE
=====

The compiler exceeds the allocated memory limit.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following three suggested workarounds:

 - Use compiler switch /Zm#nn to increase the compiler's heap memory allocation
   limit. The default value of #nn is 100 and the maximum value is 2000.
   Manually add this switch in Developer Studio: under the Project menu, click
   Setting, the click C/C++, then Project Options. Usually, a value of 1000
   works.

   NOTE: You may need to increase the system virtual memory to accommodate the
   increased #nn for /Zm.

   -or-

 - Remove the template class header files from the precompiled header file.

   -or-

 - Use "Automatic use of precompiled headers" (/YX switch), or, "Not using
   precompiled header."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.
