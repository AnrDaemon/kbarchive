SYMPTOMS
========

If you insert a link into a Microsoft Word 97 document from a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet as "Formatted Text(RTF)," and then apply a border to the linked
table, the border can be lost when the link is updated.

CAUSE
=====

Updating the link causes the original spreadsheet format to overwrite the
bordered object. The "\* MERGEFORMAT" switch does not preserve the borders.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Apply the border you want to the Microsoft Excel worksheet before you copy it
   to the clipboard.

   -or-

 - If a link to a Microsoft Excel worksheet has already been inserted in the
   Word document, follow these steps:
   1. Apply the border you want to the area that is referenced in the link using
      Microsoft Excel, and then save the workbook.

   2. To update the field, place the insertion point into the field and then
      press F9.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article.
