SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Chkdsk.exe tool on a hard disk that is formatted with the NTFS
file system, you may receive the following error message:

   Correcting errors in the uppercase file

Note that you can safely ignore this error message.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you upgrade Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 to Windows NT 4.0
and your hard disk is formatted using the NTFS file system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the Chkdsk.exe tool with the /f switch. To do this,
type "chkdsk /f" (without quotation marks) at the command prompt.

Note that when you type "chkdsk /f" you may receive the following prompt:

   The type of the file system is NTFS.
   Cannot lock current drive.
   Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another
   process. Would you like to schedule this volume to be
   checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N)

If you receive this prompt, press Y. The next time you restart your computer, the
Chkdsk.exe tool runs.
