TITLE   :XADM: MSW Allows Last Private Store Server to Move from Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Move Server Wizard (MSW) will move the last
Private Store server out of a site without warning. For example, if there were
two servers in a site, and one server was a Public Store only server, and the
other was a Private Store only server, when the MSW is used to move the Private
Store only server out of the site, there will be no errors.

This leaves the old site without a server containing a Private Store. The problem
is that mailboxes can be created in the old site without a home server. These
mailboxes cannot be accessed by a client.

WORKAROUND
==========

Customers with this problem need to add a Private Store to the server in the old
site. After the Private Store is created, the Administrator can give the
"stranded" mailboxes a home server.
