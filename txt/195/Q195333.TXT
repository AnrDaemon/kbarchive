SYMPTOMS
========

Under high load, Windows NT Terminal Server Edition may stop with a STOP code of
0x0000000A on SMP computers. The problem happens while a user logs off, but
because the problem only happens when there are more than 25 users, it is not so
easy to relate it to this event.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because, when logging off, USER is still processing messages
for the user's window station although the user is logging off and the thread
handling the message is already gone.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
