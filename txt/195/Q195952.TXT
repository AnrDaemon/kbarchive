PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbSSafe600 kbVisID600 kbGrpDSASP

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual InterDev, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Visual SourceSafe and Visual InterDev, the Web projects in the
Visual InterDev environment might become out of sync under certain conditions.
The most typical problem is that a file appears to be checked out in Visual
SourceSafe when it actually is not.

CAUSE
=====

If you directly manipulate files from the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, problems
with the FrontPage Server Extensions might occur because Visual InterDev caches
the state of the files in the Web project's metadata.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do one of the following to resynchronize the Web project:

 - In the Visual InterDev Project Explorer, right-click on the Web project and
   click Recalculate Links.

 - On the Project menu, click Web Project, and then click Recalculate Links.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
