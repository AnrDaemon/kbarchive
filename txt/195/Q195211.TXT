TITLE   :Windows NT Setup Detects Partitions as Unformatted or Damaged
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Windows NT, Setup may not correctly detect formatted
partitions and may display them as unformatted or damaged.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if all of the following conditions exist:

 - The combined size of the primary and extended partitions on your hard disk
   exceeds 8 gigabytes (GB).

 - You used the Fdisk.exe tool included with Microsoft Windows 98 to partition
   the hard disk.

 - You used the Windows 98 Fdisk.exe tool to create a logical drive that extends
   into the area that exceeds 8 GB.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, ensure that the combined size of the partitions
(the primary and extended partitions) is 8 GB or less, run Setup again, and then
use Disk Administrator to reclaim any unused hard disk space. To do so, use the
following steps:

1. For information about using the FDISK command to partition your hard disk,
   see the "Repartitioning Your Hard Disk" and "Formatting Your Hard Disk"
   sections in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q106423 Repartitioning Your Hard Disk to Upgrade to 6.0 or 6.2

   NOTE: You can use the Windows 98 Startup disk in place of the MS-DOS 6.0, 6.2,
   6.21, or 6.22 disks mentioned in the article.

2. Run Setup again.

3. After Windows NT is installed, use Disk Administrator to reclaim any unused
   space on the hard disk:

   a. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then
      click Disk Administrator. If this is the first time you have started Disk
      Administrator, click OK, and then click Yes.


   b. Click the unused partition that you want to reclaim, right-click the
      unused partition, and then click Create.

   c. Click Yes.

   d. In the Create Partition Of Size box, type the size of the partition you
      want, and then click OK.

   e. On the Partition menu, click Commit Changes Now, and then click Yes.

   f. Click OK, and then click OK.

   g. Right-click the partition you configured in steps B-F, and then click
      Format.

   h. Click Start, and then click OK.

   i. When the format process is complete, click OK, click Close, and quit Disk
      Administrator.
