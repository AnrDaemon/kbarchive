TITLE   :SMS: CHECK20 Misidentifies SMS 1.2 Client as an SMS 2.0 Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms120

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Check20.exe is a utility added to the Smsls.bat file in Systems Management
Server 1.2 Service Pack 4 to check for the existence of a Systems Management
Server 2.0 client. If %windir% is not in the path, Check20.exe will fail and
return errorlevel 1 instead of errorlevel 2. This causes the Smsls.bat calls to
CLI_NT and INVWIN32 to be skipped.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Systems
Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the Systems Management
Server site server:

1. In the <SMS_root>\Site.srv\maincfg.box\client.src directory, replace
   the Check20.exe file with the version obtained from the hotfix.

   NOTES:

    - Both Intel x86 and Alpha use the same file.

    - You can perform Step 1 automatically by using Hotfix.exe with the provided
      Hotfix.ini file.

   Maintenance Manager will replicate this file to the Systems Management Server
   logon servers on its next work cycle.

2. Update the Check20.exe located in the Repl\Export\Scripts and
   Repl\Import\Scripts of the site's Windows NT logon servers.
