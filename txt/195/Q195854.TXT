TITLE   :SMS: Poor Mouse Control Using Cirrus-Logic 5436/34 w/ WUSER32
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2 SP3,1.2 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2 SP3, 1.2 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to take Remote Control of a Compaq Deskpro 2000 computer with
the Cirrus Logic 5436/5434 chipset, you will see mouse hesitations. The severity
of this problem increases with the increase in the amount of colors being
displayed. For example, the mouse hesitation is a problem with 256 colors, but
the mouse is virtually unusable when you are showing 65536 colors. This problem
occurs regardless of the driver version loaded on the computer.

CAUSE
=====

Capturing the screen image using BitBlt can take a substantial amount of time,
and no mouse movement can be processed while the capture is happening. The jerky
mouse movement increases with the screen resolution because Systems Management
Server captures a 256 color image of the screen, so screen resolutions other
than 256 colors must go through a color translation step that can take a
considerable amount of time.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use a faster video card or a faster processor.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2 Service Pack 3 and Service Pack 4.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
