KEYWORDS:kbvfp600 kbVS600sp3 kbGrpDSFox

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Previous versions of the Component Gallery and Class Browser utilities did not
provide a method for determining the current version of the application. The
October 1998 Gallery update, Vfp6gal.exe, adds a new property to the Component
Gallery/Class Browser object model that stores the version information. The
property name is "cVersion".

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3 readme erroneously lists this article
as describing a fixed bug. This is a HOWTO and not a BUG article.

You can download the October 1998 Gallery update, Vfp6gal.exe, from the following
Web address:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/vfoxpro/downloads/updates.asp

With the updated Component Gallery/Class Browser installed and running, you can
determine the version as follows:

   ?_obrowser.cVersion  && Component Gallery/Class Browser Version
