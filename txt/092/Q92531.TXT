TITLE   :BUG: CreatePatternBrush() with Large Bitmap GP Fault
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a machine with an 8514/a video adapter running the Microsoft Windows
graphical environment with the standard 8514/a video driver, when an application
calls the CreatePatternBrush() function to create a brush based on a bitmap
larger than 8 pixels by 8 pixels, Windows terminates the application with an
application execution error.

CAUSE
=====

Contrary to the documentation for the CreatePatternBrush() function on page 114
of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) "Programmer's Reference,
Volume 2: Functions" manual, this function does not trim a bitmap larger than 8
pixels by 8 pixels to this size.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Microsoft Windows version 3.1.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
