SUMMARY
=======

HIDAPP is a sample DLL (dynamic-link library) that uses a hidden application to
do file I/O for the DLL. Using this architecture, it is possible for multiple
applications to link to the DLL and access the file through the DLL.

It is often desirable to have a DLL open and manage a data file. This way, many
applications can link to the DLL and access the file. Because all access is done
through the DLL, there are no problems associated with having more than one
application opening the file at the same time.

Under Windows, DLLs cannot own files; only applications can. File handles are
indices into the file table, which is stored in the task database. When a DLL
opens a file, the application that called the DLL owns that file handle. If a
DLL saves the file handle in a global variable and then later tries to use it
when it is called by a different application, then that file handle will be
invalid.

This HIDAPP sample application discusses one way to work around this limitation.
It consists of a DLL that uses a hidden application to access files for the DLL
that act as a server. When the first instance of client application links to the
DLL, the hidden application is executed and a data file is opened. The handle
for this data file is owned by the hidden application. After this, other client
applications may link to the DLL and call functions to add and retrieve records
from the data file. When the last client application shuts down, the DLL closes
the data file and shuts down the hidden application.
