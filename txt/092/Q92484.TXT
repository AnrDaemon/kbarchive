======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive a memory overflow error message when you print to a Hewlett-
Packard (HP) LaserJet III compatible printer. This error occurs when the printer
has 512 kilobyte (K) memory, and the Windows printer driver attempts to exceed
the printer's memory.

CAUSE
=====

Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III printers come with 1 megabyte (MB) RAM standard
while some clones of this printer come with only 512K. Because the LaserJet III
printer's minimum memory requirement is 1 MB, the Windows printer driver's
minimum setting in Control Panel is 1MB.

STATUS
======

This functionality is by design; Microsoft has no plans to change this in the
future.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the MemReserve= setting in the [modelname,
port] section of the WIN.INI file. For example:

      [HP LaserJet III,LPT1]
      MemReserve=512

The PRINTERS.WRI file incorrectly states in the "Configuring Memory on PCL
Printers" section that you should add the MemReserve= setting to the [drv name,
port] section of the WIN.INI file.
