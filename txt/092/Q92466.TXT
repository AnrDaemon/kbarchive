The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows for Workgroups and Windows File Manager represent a RAM drive as a RAM
chip icon on the toolbar. If the RAM drive is compressed by Stacker 2.0, Windows
for Workgroups and Windows display the icon as a local hard disk drive icon.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows and Windows for Workgroups File Manager use drive icons for quick access
to the available drives. There are five types of drive icons that File Manager
uses:

 - Floppy disk drives

 - Hard disk drives

 - RAM drives

 - CD-ROM drives

 - Network drives

If Stacker disk-compression software is used on a RAM drive, File Manager does
not display the normal RAM chip icon for the RAM drive. It uses a local hard
disk drive icon for the RAM drive. This does not have any affect on the
functionality of the RAM drive.
