======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install PC Tools for MS-DOS, your mouse and/or keyboard behave
erratically in Microsoft Windows, or Windows stops responding (hangs) after the
logo screen is displayed.

CAUSE
=====

During installation, PC Tools for MS-DOS, version 7.0, 7.1, or 8.0, may make the
following changes to the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

      mouse.drv=C:\PCTOOLS\SYSTEM\COMMMOU.DRV
      keyboard.drv=C:\PCTOOLS\SYSTEM\COMMKBD.DRV
      display.drv=C:\PCTOOLS\SYSTEM\COMMDIS.DRV  (version 8.0 only)
      cpdisplay.drv=<original display driver>

NOTE: The paths to these files may vary.

The entry for <original display driver> is the driver filename for the
active display drive as shown in Windows Setup.

These modifications can change mouse and/or keyboard behavior in Windows, or
cause Windows to hang.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around these problems, deactivate (comment) the lines shown above by
inserting a semicolon (;) at the beginning of each line. Then, add the following
lines to the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

      mouse.drv=MOUSE.DRV
      keyboard.drv=KEYBOARD.DRV
      display.drv=<original display driver>

These are the standard settings for the Microsoft mouse, enhanced 101- or 102-key
keyboard, and current display driver. If you are using a different mouse, or
keyboard, run Setup to reinstall the appropriate driver(s).

NOTE: This workaround disables the PC Tools Commute application.
