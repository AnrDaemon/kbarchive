TITLE   :PRB: Display Monitor Goes Blank After the Logo Display
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit
PROD/VER::3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit (DDK) for Windows, versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under the debugging version of Windows, you may see something like "GlobalAlloc
failed" or some other messages indicating problems, after the logo is displayed.
Under non-debug Windows, the logo will display, then the screen will clear, then
nothing else seems to happen. You must press CTRL+ALT+DEL to reset the system.

Note: This should happen only while developing a display driver that implements
device bitmaps.

CAUSE
=====

The display driver device returned 0 (zero) to fail a RealizeObject() function
call after setting the RC_DEVBITS value in the dpRaster member of the GDIINFO
structure.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the device driver to prevent it from failing the RealizeObject() function
call. A device driver cannot fail this call under Microsoft Windows 3.1. See
section 2.1.14 of the 3.1 Device Driver Kit (DDK) "Device Driver Adaptation
Guide" (DDAG) for more information.
