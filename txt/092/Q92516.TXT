The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your machine may stop responding (hang) or suddenly exit to the MS-DOS command
prompt when you copy a large number of files over the network.

Usually Windows for Workgroups provides an error message that says to increase
NetHeapSize, but the machine may also exit to the MS-DOS command prompt or hang.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, increase the NetHeapSize in the [386Enh] section of
your SYSTEM.INI file. The default value is 12; for troubleshooting, try 32, 64,
or 128.

Increasing NetHeapSize can reduce problems when your network is running under a
heavy load and you are running the real mode redirector.

NOTE: NetHeapSize is ignored by the virtual redirector.
