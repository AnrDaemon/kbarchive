SUMMARY
=======

NET.EXE may display one of the following messages if your computer is running
low on memory.

If you have under 102 kilobytes (K) memory:

   Cannot execute C:\SLALOM\NET.EXE

If you have between 102K and 160K memory:

   Error 8: There is not enough memory available

If you have between 160K and 180K memory:

   MS-DOS error SYS0008 occured trying to load "C:\DOS\NET.EXE"

If you have between 180K and 212K memory:

   MS-DOS error SYS0008 occured trying to load "C:\DOS\NET.EXE"
   MS-DOS error SYS000 occurred trying to allocate a [size] MCB

MORE INFORMATION
================

NET.EXE provides various error messages in these different low memory conditions
because it loads the other network components. If you have more than 160K free
memory, NET.EXE loads successfully but provides an error message if it runs out
of memory when trying to load other components, such as NetBEUI and
redirectors.

NOTE: The values for conventional memory vary because NET.EXE can load programs
into high memory or upper memory block (UMB) space if it is available.
