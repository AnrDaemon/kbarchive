SUMMARY
=======

By default, indexes are created in ascending order (for example, alphabetically
from A to Z, or by date, from January to December). Indexes can also be created
in reverse or descending order (for example, alphabetically from Z to A, or by
date, from December to January).

The character field example below demonstrates how to create an index on the
concatenation of two fields, where the first field is indexed in ascending order
and the second field is indexed in descending order. These techniques also apply
to more than two fields.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create an index on the concatenation of two fields (as described above), do
the following:

1. Create the MCOMP.PRG file to contain the following code. MCOMP creates a 255
   character string that contains the characters in descending order. For
   example:

         PRIVATE char, mdescend
         char = 255
         mdescend = ""
         DO WHILE char >= 1
            mdescend = mdescend + CHR(char)
            char = char - 1
         ENDDO
         RETURN mdescend

   NOTE: The MCOMP.PRG file must be present on the system unless you delete the
   index created in this procedure.

2. Assign the results of the MCOMP program to a variable, as follows:

   mdesc_ord = mcomp()

   NOTE: You must create this variable each time you use the descending index.
   Otherwise, FoxPro returns a "Variable not found" error.

3. Create the index using the first field, the results of a SYS(15) function,
   the variable, and the second field.

   For example, if the mdesc_ord variable is set as indicated in step 2 above,
   FNAME is the first field to be indexed in ascending order, LNAME is the
   second field to be indexed in descending (reverse) order, and INDEXNAME is
   the name of the index, you can create the index using the following code:

         INDEX ON fname + SYS(15, mdesc_ord, lname) TO file

   The SYS(15, <expC1>, <expC2>) function translates each character
   of the string <expC2> according to the string in <expC1>.
