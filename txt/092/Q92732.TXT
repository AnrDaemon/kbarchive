TITLE   :FIX: System Errors or Crash Debugging Large App in CodeView
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When debugging a very large application with versions 4.0, 4.01, or 4.05 of the
Microsoft CodeView debugger, stepping into, tracing into, or running an
application can cause various errors which can cause the system to hang. The
exact error depends on the environment in which CodeView is running.

CAUSE
=====

CodeView versions 4.0, 4.01, and 4.05 do not determine the amount of available
memory before loading an application.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that memory is available through DPMI, XMS, or VCPI to load the CodeView
application and the symbolic information for the application being debugged into
extended memory. A minimum of 2048K extended memory is required.

Remove any unnecessary device drivers or memory-resident applications to increase
the amount of available conventional memory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in CodeView versions 4.0, 4.01, and
4.05. This problem was corrected in CodeView version 4.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When CodeView is running in an MS-DOS window in the Microsoft Windows
environment, stepping into the application may generate the following error
message:

   This application has violated system integrity due to an invalid fault and
   will be terminated.

When CodeView is run directly from MS-DOS and the HIMEM.SYS memory manager is
installed, stepping into the application may generate the following error
message:

   run-time error R6915
   - DOSX16 : Unhandled exception

When CodeView is run directly from MS-DOS and the 386MAX memory manager is
installed, stepping into the application may hang the system.
