TITLE   :WFWG Setup Modifies Wrong Lines in CONFIG.SYS File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Setup may ignore REM statements in the
CONFIG.SYS file. If you are using a utility such as Bootcon, this can create
configuration problems because Bootcon uses REMs to delimit multiple boot
configurations. Windows for Workgroups Setup may inadvertently modify the wrong
configuration. For example, Setup may change the path of the Microsoft LAN
Manager Net command to the Windows for Workgroups directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, back up CONFIG.SYS before you install Windows for
Workgroups. After installation, you may need to edit the CONFIG.SYS file to
ensure Windows for Workgroups drivers and other network drivers are correctly
loaded under the proper boot configuration.

As an alternative, you can upgrade to MS-DOS 6.2 and use the Multi-Config feature
instead of Bootcon.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1 and version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 wfwfest multi-boot multi-config
