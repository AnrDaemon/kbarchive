======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mail sometimes displays a bad network connection icon in its status bar when the
network is functioning correctly. For example, you may see the bad network
connection icon and still be able to use File Manager to connect to your mail
server. You may also receive mail while Mail is displaying the bad network
connection icon.

CAUSE
=====

The icon is displayed because your system is very low on disk space. The icon
indicates that your system failed to download a message because there was
insufficient space in your mail file. Mail waits and then retries five minutes
later. If you are using Undelete Sentry or a similar undelete protection
program, less free disk space may actually be available than is indicated.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups Mail
versions 3.1 and 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11
