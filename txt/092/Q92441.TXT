Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

To select an executable, a dynamic-link library (DLL), or a driver file source
and display its file version information in the main window, choose the Open
command from the File menu. If the file does not have a version information
resource, VERSTAMP notifies you with a message box. If the file has a version
information resource, choose the More Info button in the main window to display
the information. If you choose the Install File button, VERSTAMP uses the
VerFindFile() function to determine where the source file should be installed.
If VerFindFile() returns an error, VERSTAMP displays a message box prompting you
to continue or abort. If you choose to continue, VERSTAMP proceeds with the
installation, captures the result of VerInstallFile(), and displays it in a
message box.
