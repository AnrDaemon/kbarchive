-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The upgrade versions of Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) are unable to detect an
earlier version of Windows when the Automated Setup option (SETUP.SHH) is used.
It does not matter if Windows is on the path or if Setup is run from the WINDOWS
directory. The syntax for this automated setup is as follows:

      setup /h:<path>setup.shh

NOTE: SETUP.SHH is a file that tells Windows what and where to install. It allows
for the installation of Windows with little or no user interaction.

WORKAROUND
==========

A possible solution is to modify the SETUP.SHH file.

To have the upgrade versions of Windows for Workgroups detect an earlier version
of Windows while using the Automated Setup option, remove the following section
from the SETUP.SHH file:

      [windir]
      c:\windows

NOTE: Removing these two lines causes you to be prompted for the location to
install Windows for Workgroups.

Additional query words: 3.10 set up
