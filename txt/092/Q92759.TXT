SUMMARY
=======

When attempting to open an AVI file in VidEdit from Microsoft Video for Windows
1.0, you may receive the following error message:

   Undefined Dynalink

This message occurs when an older copy of a dynamic link library file
(<filename>.DLL) is accessed in place of the DLL that shipped with
Microsoft Video for Windows 1.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some third-party multimedia applications may install all or part of their
dynamic link library files directly to the Windows Directory. If this occurs,
Microsoft Video for Windows 1.0 will not properly overwrite/replace these files
during installation. This may result in Microsoft Video for Windows accessing
these older DLL's during the operation of the application resulting in the
"Undefined Dynalink" error. One of the more common files exhibiting this
characteristic is WINCOM.DLL. To check for duplicate DLL files, run a search of
the WINDOWS directory and all subdirectories from File Manager. The DLL files
that ship with Microsoft Video for Windows 1.0 are:

   MCIOLE.DLL
   DISPDIB.DLL
   MSVIDEO.DLL
   MEDIAMAN.DLL
   WINCOM.DLL
   WRKBENCH.DLL
   PCVIDEO.DLL (When installing Video Blaster driver)
