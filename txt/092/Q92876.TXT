SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a color display adapter with a monochrome monitor, you may have
trouble reading the NET.EXE pop-up interface.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If NET.EXE detects a monochrome display, it adjusts the colors appropriately.
But if you use a color display adapter with a monochrome monitor, you need to
use the MS-DOS MODE command to set the display type as follows:

   mode mono

This ensures that the interface is readable.
