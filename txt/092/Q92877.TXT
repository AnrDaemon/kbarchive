-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you load TCP/IP as a protocol and then immediately start Windows for
Workgroups from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, your machine may stop responding (hang)
when you attempt to log on.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because TCP/IP requires time to register on the network
before you log on.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, place a pause statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
before the statement that starts Windows, as in the following example:

      pause
      win

You can also use the MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2 CHOICE command to force a timed pause
(for example, use "c:\dos\choice /N /T:n,10 Please wait for the computer to
register with the network..."). Refer to your MS-DOS documentation for more
information.

STATUS
======

This problem occurs with the Microsoft versions of TCP/IP that are available for
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Microsoft LAN Manager. This problem may or may
not occur with other implementations of TCP/IP.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1 and version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
