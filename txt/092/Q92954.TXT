SYMPTOMS
========

When using Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) in a windowed MS-DOS window in Microsoft
Windows, pasting text into the editor using the Paste command on the window
system menu causes PWB to experience problems or to hang.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Windows PIF (Program Information File) Editor to modify the PIF for PWB.
Open the PWB.PIF file from the C/C++ version 7.0 BIN directory (by default,
C700\BIN or WINDEV\BIN). Choose the Advanced options button. Then remove the
check from the Allow Fast Paste option. Choose Save from the File menu to save
the changes. Then close the PIF Editor.
