SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft FoxPro supports two types of .cdx compound index files: structural and
independent (nonstructural). An independent compound index file is created by
specifying an OF clause in the INDEX command.

Unlike the structural index file, an independent index file is not opened when
the associated database is opened. To open the index, use the SET INDEX command
or the INDEX clause of a USE command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The information below demonstrates how to create, open, and specify the order of
an independent .cdx file with multiple tags.

To create an independent index for a database, use commands such as the
following. Note that the name of the .cdx file cannot be the same as the name of
the database.

      USE OFFICES
      INDEX ON ONO TAG ONO OF Xoffices.cdx
      INDEX ON CITY TAG CITY OF Xoffices.cdx
      INDEX ON STATE TAG STATE OF Xoffices.cdx

To open a database with an associated independent .cdx file, use code such as the
following:

      USE OFFICES INDEX Xoffices.cdx
      * Set the order and list to demonstrate each tag is correct.
      SET ORDER TO TAG ONO OF Xoffices.cdx
      LIST
      SET ORDER TO TAG CITY OF Xoffices.cdx
      LIST
      SET ORDER TO TAG STATE Of Xoffices.cdx
      LIST
