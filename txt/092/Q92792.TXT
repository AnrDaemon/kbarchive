TITLE   :WFWG: Segment Load Failure with NCR MCA 486
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using an NCR MCA 486 system and you choose the Custom option when you
run the Windows for Workgroups Setup program, the Setup program fails after you
choose which components you want to install. Each time a file is copied, you
receive the following error message:

   Application error. Winsetup caused a Segment Load Failure in module setup.exe
   at 0005:128B.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the default settings in the .ADF configuration files.
If the NCR MCA setup is configured for "Automatic Config," the small computer
systems interface (SCSI) adapter is resent to DOS 4.01 and sets the logical SCSI
device number to 7.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the DOS version to MS-DOS 5 and the device
number to zero.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This affects NCR MCA systems that have been upgraded to MS-DOS 5.0 when you
select "Automatic Config" during MCA Setup.
