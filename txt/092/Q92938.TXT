======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

To ensure proper operation with Windows 3.1, If you are using Microsoft Windows
on a Packard Bell Packmate 300 SX, 386/33 or 486/33 DX computer, you may
experience general protection faults and memory parity errors in both
Windows-based and MS-DOS-based applications running under Windows.

CAUSE
=====

To ensure proper operation with Windows 3.1, the Packard Bell Packmate 386/33
and 486/33 DX computers require that the A20 handler number 1 is installed. If
the /M:1 parameter is not included on the HIMEM.SYS line in the CONFIG.SYS file,
A20 handler number 3 may be incorrectly installed, which can cause the symptoms
above.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, change the following line in the CONFIG.SYS file

        DEVICE=<drive><path>HIMEM.SYS

-to-

        DEVICE=<drive><path>HIMEM.SYS /M:1


The Packmate 486/33 DX is manufactured by Packard Bell, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
