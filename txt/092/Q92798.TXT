-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to use Media Player to play CD audio and the compact disc you are
attempting to play does not contain audio information on track 1, you may
receive the following error message:

   There is a problem with your media device. Make sure it is working correctly
   or contact the device manufacturer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you may be able to drag the thumb tab in Media
Player to track 2 (or the first track that contains audio information). Also,
other CD-audio programs, such as Musicbox, may allow this type of compact disc
to be played.

Some CD-ROM drives (for example, those that use the TSLCDR.SYS driver in the
CONFIG.SYS file) do not allow the thumb tab to be dragged in Media Player. Users
with this driver cannot play CD-ROM disks with non-audio tracks through Media
Player.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.1 CDROM first track
