The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article covers two known issues running the MS-DOS-based version of Harvard
Graphics for Windows:

 - Harvard Graphics runs very slowly in 386 enhanced mode

 - Harvard Graphics cannot run in a window

MORE INFORMATION
================

Harvard Graphics Runs Very Slowly in 386 Enhanced Mode
------------------------------------------------------

If Harvard Graphics runs very slowly in 386 enhanced mode, change the Monitor
Ports option in the HG.PIF file to Text. Harvard Graphics will run correctly in
both the standard and real modes of Windows.

When High Graphics is chosen under the Monitor Ports section, Windows monitors
the video operation of the application when it is in high-resolution graphics
mode. When Text is chosen under the Monitor Ports section, Windows will not
monitor the high-resolution mode of the application, but only the text mode.

To change the Monitor Ports option in the PIF (in enhanced mode):

1. Open the Accessories group, and choose the PIF Editor icon.

2. From the File menu, choose Open and select the HG.PIF file.

3. Choose the Advanced button.

4. Choose the Text option under Monitor Ports. (The Monitor Ports options are
   listed under Display Options.)

5. Click the High Graphics option under Monitor Ports to turn off the selection.

6. Choose OK.

7. From the File menu, choose Save to save the changes to the HG.PIF file.

8. Close the PIF Editor.

You may also apply these steps to any MS-DOS-based application if it is running
slow and has the High Graphics check box selected.

Harvard Graphics Cannot Run in a Window
---------------------------------------

If you try to start the MS-DOS-based version of Harvard Graphics in a window, you
receive the following error:

   Application Cannot Be Run in a Window. Close other Applications and Retry

Because Harvard Graphics runs in Graphics mode, it cannot be run in a window.
Check the Full-Screen option in the Harvard Graphics PIF file to prevent the
error message.

For more information on PIF creation and usage, refer to pages 442-448 of the
"Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0.
