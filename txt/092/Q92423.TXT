SUMMARY
=======

RTF source files for the Windows version 3.1 Help compiler cannot be created
using Microsoft Works for Windows version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Works for Windows 2.0 is not capable of formatting text using the
"hidden" character attribute. This particular attribute is used by the Windows
Help compiler to signify jumps to context strings. Because jumping to context
strings is critical in a help file, Microsoft Works for Windows 2.0 cannot be
used to create the RTF source files for the Windows Help compiler.
