The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

If you save a new file from a Windows-based application to a Novell NetWare
server, you may receive the following error message:

   This file is on a network drive with create but no modify privileges; ask the
   administrator of this network to change this condition.

In addition to the error message, a 0 byte file is created on the network drive.

This error occurs when you have read, write, create, modify, and file privileges,
but not delete privileges, and when the Windows-based application is using
common dialog boxes (COMMDLG.DLL).

To correct this problem, have the system administrator give you delete privileges
for the server or directory you are trying to use.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you save a new file from an application that uses common dialog boxes, a
test file is created by COMMDLG.DLL to see if the work file can be created. If
the test file is created successfully, it is deleted so that the application can
save the work file. If the attempt to delete the file fails because you don't
have delete privileges, the above error message is displayed.
