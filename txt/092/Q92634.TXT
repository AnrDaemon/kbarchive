======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups allows you to provide a machine name of up to
15 characters. However, long machine names can cause a problem with Print
Manager.

With machine names of 14 or 15 characters, Print Manager inappropriately displays
an error message for the status of any port attached to that server.

For example, if your machine is connected to \\LONGMACHINENAME\PRINTER on LPT1,
Print Manager displays

   !Error

in the Status column for that printer.

In the Status bar at the bottom of the Print Manager, the following messages are
also displayed:

   The Printer is Stalled.

   The computer name is invalid.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reduce the length of the computer name to 13
characters or fewer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1 and version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11
