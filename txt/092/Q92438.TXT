SUMMARY
=======

The External Mail program in Microsoft Mail supports an undocumented -Qx option
that supplements the documented -V (verbose) option. The -Qx option reports on
major operations and displays the results in the Activity section of the
External program screen.

The four -Qx options are as follows:

 - Q1 reports main points of the program when scanning and delivering mail.

 - Q2 reports the state of the serial buffer.

 - Q3 reports the state of the P1 files in versions 3.2 and 3.0. It is not
   available in Microsoft Mail version 2.1.

 - Q4 reports memory usage.

Each option places its report in the "LAN Postoffice Mail Activity" section of
External's program screen.

The -Q4 option does not log any information into the SESSION.LOG file. The memory
usage information reported by -Q4 is cryptic, especially in Microsoft Mail
version 2.1.

The -Qx options are meant for advanced developers and product support personnel
to help them debug programs and troubleshoot problems. Because of the technical
and cryptic nature of the -Qx reports, they can be misleading to less technical
users.
