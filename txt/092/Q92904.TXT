-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Quarterdeck QEMM386 memory manager with Windows, you may receive
the following error when you try to start Windows in 386 enhanced mode:

   CANNOT FIND A DEVICE FILE THAT MAY BE NEEDED TO RUN WINDOWS IN 386 ENHANCED
   MODE

   YOU NEED TO RUN SETUP AGAIN.

   C:\WINHIRAM.VXD

   PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE

CAUSE
=====

This error message is displayed because QEMM386 and Windows require the
WINHIRAM.VXD file to transfer memory control when Windows loads.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The WINHIRAM.VXD file is copied to the QEMM directory when you install QEMM386.
The above error normally occurs when the QEMM386.SYS file is moved to another
subdirectory without the WINHIRAM.VXD file. To correct this problem, copy the
WINHIRAM.VXD file to the same subdirectory as the QEMM386.SYS file. If this does
not correct the problem, try adding the subdirectory that contains these files
to the MS-DOS path.
