You cannot redirect or substitute a network drive for a local drive in
File Manager. If you need this functionality, use the MS-DOS-based
real-mode redirector, Net.

In general, redirecting local drives is not recommended. However, in
some cases, you may need to do this in order to work with a program
that is hard-coded for a specific drive. For example, some
installation programs allow you to install from the drive A only. You
can redirect drive A to a network drive with Net and then use the
installation program successfully.
