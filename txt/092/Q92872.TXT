-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Setup does not perform an upgrade over
Microsoft Windows version 3.1 if it does not detect enough free disk space. If
Setup fails for some reason and you run Setup a second time, it may refuse to
upgrade your system.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if Setup incorrectly detects insufficient free disk space.
Setup assumes it is upgrading Windows 3.1 and does not account for the Windows
for Workgroups files it has already transferred.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, delete some Windows for Workgroups files before you
start Setup. The following are some files you can safely delete:

   NETAPI.DLL
   PMSPL.DLL
   WIN386.EXE

You can also delete files with the extensions .BMP and .HLP. These files are
copied again when you run Setup.

NOTE: Avoid deleting files with the extensions .INI and .GRP. Such files contain
information about your custom Windows configuration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows for Workgroups Setup uses WINVER.EXE to determine which version of
Windows it is installing over. Unfortunately, WINVER.EXE is one of the last
files to transfer. Often in a failed installation, WINVER.EXE does not get
copied; therefore, Setup thinks that it is upgrading Windows 3.1.
