SYMPTOMS
========

When you print on a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 550C color printer, black
output may appear green.

CAUSE
=====

Hewlett-Packard ships a printer driver with the HP DeskJet 550C for use with
Windows version 3.1 that has Print Mode options in the Setup dialog box. (This
dialog box is accessed by choosing the Printer icon in Control Panel and
choosing the Setup button). According to Hewlett-Packard, the HP DeskJet 550C
prints using two ink cartridges: Black and Color. When Print Mode is set to All
Color, only the color cartridge is used to print. Black is created using yellow,
magenta, and cyan inks, giving a black/green color.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the Print Mode to Black And Color or Black/Greyscale.

1. Choose the Printer icon in Control Panel.

2. Choose the Setup button.

3. Set the Print Mode to Black And Color or Black/Greyscale.

This will cause the printer to use the black ink cartridge rather than the color
cartridge for printing black.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The HP DeskJet 550C printer driver is manufactured by Hewlett-Packard, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
