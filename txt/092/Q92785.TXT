======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have different versions of COMMAND.COM, MSDOS.SYS, and IO.SYS on your
computer, the following error message may appear when you boot your machine:

   Incorrect DOS Version

To work around this problem, you need to boot from an MS-DOS boot disk, for
example, the MS-DOS Uninstall disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

To verify the versions of MSDOS.SYS and IO.SYS, type "VER" (without the
quotation marks) at the command prompt, then type "COMMAND" (without the
quotation marks) to verify the version of the command interpreter.

If VER and COMMAND do not report identical versions and manufacturers, you must
reinstall the operating system so that COMMAND.COM and the system files have the
same version number and are from the same manufacturer.

Additional query words: 6.22 5.00 6.00 5.00a 6.20
