SUMMARY
=======

In Windows for Workgroups, the standard-mode startup ("boot") process is
slightly different than the process for Windows version 3.1. This article
describes the procedure for starting Windows for Workgroups in standard mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following procedure starts the network connections and Windows for
Workgroups in standard mode.

1. The user starts the network software by typing "net logon" (without the
   quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt. If the user logs onto the
   network successfully, the persistent network connections are restored (for
   example, file and printer connections active during the last Windows for
   Workgroups session.)

2. The user starts WIN.COM by typing "win" (without the quotation marks) at the
   MS-DOS command prompt.

   Note: If you are using a 386 machine and you type "win", your system attempts
   to start in enhanced mode. Type "win/s" (without the quotation marks) to
   enter standard mode.

3. WIN.COM invokes the MS-DOS EXEC function to load DOSX to provide extended
   memory access support.

4. DOSX loads the standard-mode kernel (KRNL286.EXE).

5. KRNL286.EXE loads the following files:

    - The Windows drivers (identified as *.DRV in the SYSTEM.INI file)

    - GDI.EXE

    - USER.EXE

    - Supporting files (for example, fonts)

    - WFWNET.DRV (the Windows for Workgroups network driver)

6. WFWNET.DRV loads the Network DDE background application (NETDDE.EXE) and the
   ClipBook Server background application (CLIPSRV.EXE).

7. WFWNET.DRV prompts the user to log on to the network if the user has not done
   so already. If the user logs on to the network successfully, the WFWNET.DRV
   then restores the persistent network connections (for example, file and
   printer connections active during the last Windows for Workgroups session).

8. KRNL286.EXE launches the Windows shell identified by the shell= entry in the
   [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. By default, this is the Windows
   Program Manager.
