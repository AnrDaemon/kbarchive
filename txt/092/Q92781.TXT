The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a shared resource name includes a space, you must use quotation
marks around the name whenever you refer to the resource in a dialog
box or at the command prompt. For example, if you name your computer
"My Computer," you must use quotation marks in the NET USE command
line as follows:

        NET USE F: "\\My Computer\Public"

NOTE: While this works for the NET USE command, Microsoft recommends
that you do not put a space in your computer name. Microsoft Mail may
fail if the computer name contains a space.
