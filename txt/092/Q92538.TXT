   Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

In the original version of the sample, some of the values entered in the Set
LogFont dialog box are mapped incorrectly to the underlying LOGFONT structure.
The value entered for Italic is mapped into the LOGFONT's lfUnderline field and
the value entered for Underline is mapped into the LOGFONT's lfItalic field.
This causes an italic font to be created when an underline font is specified and
an underline font to be created when an italic font is specified. The version of
FONTEST in the Software Library corrects this problem.

When printing in the original version, if you choose a font from the Choose Font
common dialog box, the output will be in a smaller size font than the output of
the same font from another Windows-based application such as Microsoft Write.

The common dialog box function ChooseFont() always returns the height of the font
in the lfHeight field of the LOGFONT structure based on the vertical dpi (dots
per inch) of the screen. When creating a font to send to the printer, it is
necessary to adjust the lfHeight field of the LOGFONT structure using the
vertical dpi of the printer. To adjust the height, use the following formula:

   Height = -(dpiY*point_size/72); //dpiY is dots per inch in Y direction
