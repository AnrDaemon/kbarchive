The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Some shell programs may not behave correctly when you run them with Windows for
Workgroups; when you exit these shell programs, you may not exit Windows. In
this situation, the correct behavior for a shell program is to exit windows.

An example of a shell program is Windows Program Manager. When you exit Program
Manager, you also exit Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows version 3.0, an application determines that it is the shell by
checking the number of tasks that are currently running. Because Windows for
Workgroups starts some tasks before the shell, this manner of determining shell
status does not work. To correctly determine shell status, applications should
check the "shell=" line in the [boot] section of SYSTEM.INI file.

For information about how your shell determines shell status, contact the
supplier of your shell program.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Create a directory called WINDOWS\WFWINIT.

2. Copy the following files from your WINDOWS directory to the newly created
   WINDOWS\WFWGINIT directory:

   PRINTMAN.EXE
   CLIPSRV.EXE
   NETDDE.EXE

3. Delete or rename the original files.

4. Create program items in your startup group that start each of these files
   from the WINDOWS\WFWGINT directory.
