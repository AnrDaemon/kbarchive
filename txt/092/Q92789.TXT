The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows for Workgroups does not detect the direct memory access (DMA) channel
used by the Etherlink Plus card. To set up the DMA channel for Etherlink, use
the Windows Control Panel to manually set the DMA channel during or after
installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the Windows for Workgroups Setup program sets the DMA to channel 1,
which is the factory default for this card. However, since 3Com recommends DMA
channels 5, 6, or 7 for a 16-bit slot (the most common) this setting may not be
correct for your card. Therefore, if you have the Etherlink Plus card in a
16-bit slot and have changed your DMA channel to 5, 6, or 7, you must run
Control Panel and adjust the DMA Channel setting.
