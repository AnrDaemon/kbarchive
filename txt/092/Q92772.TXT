TITLE   :No Files Found with SMC 90C65 Based Arcnet Cards in WFWG
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Arcnet network interface cards based on the Standard Microsystems Corporation
(SMC) 90C65 controller chip may generate the

   No Files Found

error when you attempt to view a directory of a network drive in File Manager
with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups (WFWG).

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no work around for this problem. The only correction is a hardware
modification to the card. Contact the manufacturer of the network card for
specific information on upgrading the affected chip.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a network card with this chip is used on a Windows for Workgroups server with
the NetBEUI protocol, a Windows for Workgroups workstation can browse and
successfully connect to the server, but the "No Files Found" error is generated
even though there are files in the shared directory. Other symptoms of this
problem are the inability to run:

 - Novell's TurboKit drivers

 - Artisoft's Lantastic SMCARC drivers

 - Possibly other NetBEUI protocol networking software products

The SMC120 Arcnet card uses their top-of-the-line ASL30519 Arcnet controller
chip. The SMC 90C65 Arcnet Controller Chip contains a subset of the instructions
in SMC's ASL30519 Arcnet Controller Chip. The 90C65 chip is used in several OEM
Arcnet network interface cards, but is not used in any SMC Arcnet boards.

The products included here (other than Windows) are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
