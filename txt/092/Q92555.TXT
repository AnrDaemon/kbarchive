The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups allows multiple users to use the same machine
through the use of PassWord cache Lists (PWLs). Windows for Workgroups also
supports null passwords (an empty password).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Windows for Workgroups has the Logon At Startup option selected in Control
Panel, and the previous user has a PWL file with a null password, the Logon
dialog box is bypassed at startup.

To allow a different user to log on to the Windows for Workgroups machine, the
previous user must be logged off. To do this, use the Logoff button in the
Control Panel.

Windows for Workgroups always provides the previous user's name at the logon
prompt during Windows for Workgroups startup.

Additional query words: 3.1 3.10 by-passed 3.11 nul startup
