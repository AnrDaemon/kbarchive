======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a command requires a file lock and the corresponding file is not already
locked, FoxPro attempts to lock the file. Similarly, when a command requires a
record lock and the corresponding record is not already locked, FoxPro attempts
to lock the record. If the lock attempt is successful, FoxPro executes the
command and releases the lock.

For a list of commands that automatically lock a file or individual records, see
the table below.

Use manual locking commands in the following situations:

 - When you are editing a database with the CHANGE or EDIT command and a format
   file.

 - When you are editing a database using a memory variable and a command such as
   SCATTER. Note that the GATHER command locks each record as it updates the
   database; however, not locking the record during the editing process can
   introduce data-integrity problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following commands automatically lock a file or individual records, as
indicated:
