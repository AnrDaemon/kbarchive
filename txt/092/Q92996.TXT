TITLE   :Local Printer Causes 1st Network Print Job to Disappear
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Windows for Workgroups server that is sharing a local printer, network
print jobs may disappear from the Print Manager. If the local printer encounters
an error, such as running out of paper, while printing a local job and other
network jobs are queued, the Print Manager pauses and the first network job
listed in the queue disappears. If more than one network job is waiting to
print, the second and subsequent network print jobs are not affected. This error
only occurs if the current print job is from the local machine.

There is no way to recover a lost network print job; you must resend it to the
printer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1 and version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.10 remote 3.11
