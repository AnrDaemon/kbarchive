-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 does not include software to
support remote access to a LAN Manager or a Windows for Workgroups network.

The Microsoft Remote Access Service (RAS) version 1.1 client for Windows for
Workgroups is available from Microsoft. It provides the ASYBEUI protocol that
allows a computer using a modem and running the RAS 1.1 client to call up a LAN
Manager server running the RAS 1.1 server software. The Windows for Workgroups
workstation can then access remote network resources as if it were on the
network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Support for RAS 1.1 is provided by Microsoft LAN Manager Product Support. RAS
1.1 client support is a fee-based service. RAS 1.1 server installation support
is free for the first 30 days; after that time, RAS support is also fee based.

Windows for Workgroups users can purchase the RAS 1.1 client by calling Microsoft
Customer Sales at (800) 426-9400.
