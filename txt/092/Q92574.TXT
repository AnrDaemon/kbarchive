-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft WinLogin, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

WinLogin adds a NULL character to all INI files that it manages. Any sections
that are added to the INI file during a Windows session are added after the NULL
character. This prevents the new sections from being saved when you exit and
restart Windows. Editing the file in Windows Write, deleting the NULL character,
and saving the file corrects this problem.

Note: The Windows Write application has to be used to edit the INI files. The
NULL character does not show up if the files are edited in the Windows Notepad.

This information applies to version 1.0 of Microsoft WinLogin. For information
about ordering Microsoft WinLogin, call the Microsoft Sales Information Center
(MSIC) at (800) 426-9400, or mail the form supplied with the Windows Resource
Kit (WRK) for the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With Microsoft WinLogin, INI files are set up by the system administrator for
specific settings for users and workstations. By default, WinLogin manages the
PROGMAN.INI, SYSTEM.INI, and WIN.INI files. The specific INI files set up by the
administrator are merged together when Windows starts with WinLogin installed.
During this merging process, the NULL character is placed at the end of the
file.

If, for example, a program is installed or a printer is added with Control Panel,
any INI entries that are added in the process are placed after the NULL
character. If the NULL character is not removed before exiting Windows, all
changes to the INI files will be lost.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in WinLogin version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
