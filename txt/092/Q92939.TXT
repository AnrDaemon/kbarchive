KEYWORDS:win31kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft PostScript Printer Driver version 3.53 with some
PostScript printers, changing the Halftone Frequency setting does not affect the
output of the printer. The Halftone Frequency setting is accessible through the
Advanced Options of Printer Setup for a PostScript printer.

CAUSE
=====

The Halftone Frequency setting controls the number of lines per inch used in
producing halftone screens of gray scale images. On some PostScript printers,
including the IBM 4029 and the Linotronic 100, changing this setting from its
default of 60 does not change the output of the printer. This problem only
occurs when using Microsoft PostScript Driver version 3.53.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only workaround is to revert to the PostScript Driver version 3.5, which
ships with Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the PostScript Printer Driver
version 3.53. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.
