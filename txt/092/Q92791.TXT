======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use File Manager to copy a file that is being used by another
application, the following error message is generated:

   Access denied, source file may be in use.

However, if you use the COPY command from MS-DOS Prompt to copy a file that is
being used by another application, the file copies successfully.

CAUSE
=====

For security reasons, File Manager refuses to copy files that another
application might be in the process of changing. The COMMAND.COM portion of
MS-DOS does not check to see of if the file is being changed by another
application.

NOTE: To avoid losing data, do not try to copy files that are being modified by
either Windows-based or MS-DOS-based applications.
