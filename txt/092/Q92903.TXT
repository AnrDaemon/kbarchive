SUMMARY
=======

AutoCAD 386 version 12 is an MS-DOS-based program that comes with its own
program information file (PIF), ACAD.PIF. The ACAD.PIF includes ACAD.EXE as the
program filename; however, Autodesk has confirmed that loading ACAD.EXE does not
allow AutoCAD to work with Microsoft Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

AutoCAD comes with a batch file called ACADR12.BAT, which should replace
ACAD.EXE as the program filename in the ACAD.PIF. This batch file sets all the
environment variables that allow AutoCAD version 12 to work with Windows 3.1.

For more information, call Autodesk Technical Support.

AutoCAD 386 is manufactured by Autodesk, Inc., a vendor independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance
or reliability.
