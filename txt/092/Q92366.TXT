SUMMARY
=======

You can display a custom MS-DOS prompt when you run MS-DOS Prompt from Program
Manager.

Changing the MS-DOS Prompt Under Windows 3.1 and 3.11
-----------------------------------------------------

Under Windows 3.1 you can change the look of the MS-DOS command prompt inside of
Windows because the WINPMT environment variable was added to Windows. You can
change this variable by using the SET command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For
example:

        SET WINPMT=Windows Shell - $p$g

Changing the MS-DOS Prompt Under Windows 3.0 and 3.0a
-----------------------------------------------------

To change the MS-DOS command prompt in Windows 3.0 and 3.0a, you must create a
batch file to modify the PROMPT environment variable. You can then start the
batch file instead of COMMAND.COM. The following is a sample batch file:

      @echo off
      prompt Windows Shell - $p$g
      command.com

After making the batch file, change the MS-DOS Prompt icon's program name from
COMMAND.COM to the name of the batch file from the Program Item Properties
dialog box.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.00a 3.10 dos box prompt prmt pmtwinprompt winprompt= winprmt= winpmt=
