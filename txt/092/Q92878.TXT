-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message in Windows for Workgroups if you try
to remove NET.EXE from memory:

   MS-DOS Popup for Workgroups could not be removed

CAUSE
=====

This error is generated if you attempt to unload terminate-and- stay-resident
(TSR) programs out of sequence. To remove TSR programs, you must unload them in
the reverse sequence that you loaded them. (For example, you would first unload
the last driver you loaded.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

NET.EXE can be loaded each time you need it, or you can load it as a TSR with
the NET STOP POPUP command. If you load a TSR after NET.EXE, you must first
unload that TSR before you unload NET.EXE.

This problem often occurs if you load TSRs from the AutoStart line in the
[network] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
