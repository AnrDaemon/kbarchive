-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a .TTF or .FOT file becomes corrupt, Quattro Pro for Windows does not print
graphs correctly. This problem mainly affects the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet
II printers, although it may also affect the LaserJet III and Canon printers in
HP emulation mode.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Delete the .TTF and .FOT files from the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

2. Delete the corresponding entries from the [Fonts] section of the WIN.INI
   file.

3. Run Control Panel.

4. Choose the Font icon.

5. Reinstall the TrueType fonts.

Once the Quattro graph is corrupt, the corruption cannot be reversed. You must
re-create the graph.
