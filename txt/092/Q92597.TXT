TITLE   :Disabling an Inactive Persistent Connection
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have persistent connections enabled, but you can't use File Manager to
disconnect a network drive connection that isn't currently active.

CAUSE
=====

If a persistent connection cannot be made to a server, it does not display in
File Manager. Because it does not show up in File Manager, you can't use File
Manager to disable the persistent connection.

WORKAROUND
==========

To disable an inactive persistent connection, you must use the NET USE command
from the MS-DOS command prompt.

In the following example, drive M is an inactive persistent connection:

   NET USE M: /D /PER:NO

This disables the connection, but causes the following error message to be
displayed:

   Error 3: The specified path was not found.

To verify that the persistent connection has indeed been disabled, use the
command:

   NET USE /PER:LIST

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups offers a feature known as persistent
connections. This feature allows Windows for Workgroups to automatically
reconnect a workstation to various network drives as configured by the user.
Persistent connections are normally handled through the File Manager, but File
Manager cannot disable a persistent connection if the connection is not
currently active.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1. This problem does not occur in later versions of the product.

Additional query words: 3.1 3.10
