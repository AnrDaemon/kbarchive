Microsoft Windows version 3.1 has over 30 callback functions that applications
can use to enumerate objects, hook into the hardware, and perform a variety of
other activities. The article explains why normal member functions cannot be
used as callback functions and gives several techniques for handling callbacks.
The article and source code are targeted toward Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0, but
the ideas presented apply to all C++ compilers, including those by Borland and
Zortech.

CALLB contains eight makefiles that create six executables: MAKE1 creates CPROG1;
MAKE2 generates a compile-time error and does not create an executable; MAKE3,
MAKE4, MAKE5, and MAKE6 create CPROG3, CPROG4, CPROG5, and CPROG6, respectively;
and TMAKE creates CTIMER. Please refer to "Calling All Members: Member Functions
as Callbacks" for more information.

NOTE: Running CPROG1 generates a general protection (GP) fault by design.

CALLB was built and tested under Microsoft Windows version 3.1.
