======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the 3Com EtherLink III (3C509) network card is configured in EISA mode and is
in an EISA machine, the driver (ELNK3.DOS) fails to load when you start the
system.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs on any EISA bus machine that has only one EISA 3Com
EtherLink III card because Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 Setup adds an
IOADDRESS= parameter to the PROTOCOL.INI file.

NOTE: This problem does not occur in later versions of Windows for Workgroups.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the IOADDRESS= line from the appropriate section of the PROTOCOL.INI
file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The EISA mode of the 3Com EtherLink III card forces the card to an I/O address
that cannot be set from Control Panel. Later, when the machine is restarted, the
driver (ELNK3.DOS) double-checks to see that a driver is present at the
IOADDRESS= location. In the EISA case, this is not true so the driver reports an
error, and does not load.

Because the ELNK3.DOS driver can find the EtherLink III card in either an ISA bus
or an EISA bus machine, it does not need the IOADDRESS= or SLOT= parameter in
the PROTOCOL.INI file. These settings should only be used if there is more than
one EtherLink III card in the machine.
