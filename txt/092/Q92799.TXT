SUMMARY
=======

The [mci] section of the Windows SYSTEM.INI file contains the following line
specifying the MCI waveform driver:

        WaveAudio=mciwave.drv value

where "value" is an integer between 2 and 9. This value is the number of seconds
that MCIWAVE.DRV buffers audio data during playback or record. This value is
directly related to the amount of memory that MCIWAVE.DRV allocates for the
buffering. If there is no value listed, MCIWAVE.DRV uses the default value of
4.

Note: If you change the value on the WaveAudio line in the SYSTEM.INI file to a
number outside the range 2 to 9, Windows uses the default value of 4.

You can modify this setting in Control Panel using the procedure listed below.
