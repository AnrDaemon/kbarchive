-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 4.1, 7.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In an application developed with the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) that
uses the CFile class, the Write() member function may appear not to correctly
process the carriage return-linefeed (CR/LF) combination unless both the
carriage return and linefeed are explicitly stated.

For example, the following code

      CFile file;
      // ...
      file.Write("Hello\n", 6);
      file.Write("Hello\n", 6);

produces the following output:

-------------------
Hello
     Hello
-------------------

However, the following code

      file.Write("Hello\n\r", 7);
      file.Write("Hello\n\r", 7);

produces the following output:

-------------------
Hello
Hello
-------------------

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an application uses the CStdioFile class derived from CFile, an application
can open a file in either text mode or binary mode. Using a CStdioFile object is
the preferred method to place a CR/LF combination into a file. However, if the
application must use a CFile object, a CR/LF combination may be explicitly
output as demonstrated above.
