KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Windows or Windows for Workgroups when the third-party memory
manager is not loaded, and then later you activate the memory manager, you may
receive an error message stating that the "SystemROMBreakpoint=FALSE" line must
be added to your SYSTEM.INI file.

You may also receive this error message if you do not indicate where the WINDOWS
directory is located when you install a third-party memory manager.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around either of the above situations, add the
"SystemROMBreakpoint=FALSE" line to the [386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "SystemROMBreakpoint=FALSE" line should be installed in the SYSTEM.INI file
by the Setup program for Windows for Workgroups or Windows when some third-party
memory managers (such as QEMM, 386MAX, and BlueMAX) are installed.
