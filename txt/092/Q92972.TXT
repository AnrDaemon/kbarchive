SUMMARY
=======

If your graphics print jobs take a long time to print to a PostScript printer
through a parallel port (LPT1-3), you can clear the Compress Bitmaps check box
in the Advanced Options dialog box to improve the print speed. However, there is
a tradeoff -- the application from which you are printing does not regain
control as fast (that is, the hourglass takes longer to return to a pointer).

If you print through a serial port (COM 1-4), you should not clear the Compress
Bitmaps check box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Changing the Compress Bitmaps option does not affect either device fonts or
TrueType fonts, and does not affect printing speed for text-only documents.

Clearing the Compress Bitmaps check box increases the amount of time before
control is returned to the application, but decreases the total time required to
print.

If you want control to be returned to the application as quickly as possible,
select the Compress Bitmap check box.

Setting the Compress Bitmap Option
----------------------------------

1. Run Control Panel and choose the Printers icon.

2. Select the PostScript printer you are using from the list of Installed
   Printers.

3. Choose the Setup button.

4. Choose the Options button.

5. Choose the Advanced button.

6. Select or clear the Compress Bitmaps check box, depending on your preference.

7. Choose the OK button three times, and choose the Close button to save your
   changes.
