SYMPTOMS
========

Ungermann-Bass Ethernet cards use a shared-memory window in the upper memory
area (UMA). The Network Driver Interface Standard (NDIS) media access control
(MAC) driver attempts to initialize the card when it loads. During this process,
it initializes the shared-memory window; however, if a memory manager has been
set up to use this memory window, initialization fails.

If the memory window has not been excluded from an upper memory manager (such as
EMM386), error messages similar to those below may be displayed when the media
access control driver loads:

   MS$NIUPCTP: Initialization started.

   MS$NIUPCTP: The NIU failed its diagnostic tests. Please check the network
   connection, configuration parameters, and hardware installation.

   MS$NIUPCTP: Initialization failed.

When NET.EXE attempts to bind, you also receive the following error message:

   Error 5733: The protocol manager has reported an incomplete binding.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, exclude the shared-memory window with your memory
manager. Using EMM386.EXE, exclude the memory address for the shared-memory
window by specifying the X= parameter on the device line in the CONFIG.SYS file
for EMM386. For example, for the Ungermann-Bass NIUpc with the shared-memory
windows configured for D800-DFFF, you would use the following:

        DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS X=D800-DFFF

NOTE: The Ungermann-Bass NIUpc/EOTP is software configurable for A000, A800,
B000, B800, C000, C800, D000, D800, E000, E800. The most common default
configurations are D800-DFFF or C800-CFFF.
