TITLE   :WFWG: SMARTDrive Command Line Cannot Contain Backslash
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following passage from section 12.7 of the README.WRI file that is shipped
with Windows for Workgroups incorrectly references a SMARTDrive command line
option:

   In addition, you must have SMARTDrive installed and you must NOT disable
   double-buffering by removing or remarking out the \D option in the CONFIG.SYS
   file.

This information is incorrect. The double buffer option of SMARTDrive is NOT
valid if it contains a backslash character. The correct syntax is a forwardslash
character, such as /D or /Double_Buffer.

The Windows version 3.1 README.WRI file contains the same incorrect syntax for
SMARTDrive in section 11.8.

This error does not occur in later versions of Windows or Windows for Workgroups.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The README.WRI file also indicates that SMARTDrive must be installed for small
computer system interface (SCSI) hard drive controllers that use direct memory
access (DMA). This refers only to the double buffering device driver installed
with SMARTDrive in the CONFIG.SYS file. Loading SMARTDrive in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file provides disk caching and is not necessary to load Windows in enhanced mode
with devices that need double buffering.

REFERENCES
==========

For more information about SMARTDrive, Virtual DMA Services, and double
buffering, see pages 252-256 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" manual for
version 3.1.
