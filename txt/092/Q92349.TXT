======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing a USE <file> command causes a "Structural CDX file not found"
error to occur.

CAUSE
=====

The associated structural .CDX file is not present in the current directory and
SAFETY is on.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following three methods to remove the reference from the CDX file
and allow FoxPro to open the DBF file:

1. Choose the Ignore button instead of the Cancel button. FoxPro removes the
   reference to the structural .CDX file from the .DBF file header and displays
   a message to indicate that the reference was removed. FoxPro opens the
   database file after removing the reference.

2. Use SET SAFETY OFF to suppress the error message. However, because this
   method disables the file-protection facility, no warning is displayed when a
   file may be overwritten.

3. Use an ON ERROR statement to trap the structural .CDX file error. With the
   code below, FoxPro can automatically remove the reference without displaying
   an error message.

         SET SAFETY ON                    && Enable file protection.
         USE customer                     && Open a DBF file.
         INDEX ON city TAG city ADDITIVE  && Create structural CDX file.
         CLOSE ALL                        && Close all files.
         DELETE FILE customer.cdx         && Remove CDX file.

         ON ERROR WAIT WINDOW "REMOVING REFERENCE AUTOMATICALLY" NOWAIT
         *** Trap the error and print a message

         USE customer
         *** Invoke the ON ERROR routine to automatically remove the
         *** reference.

         WAIT WINDOW "OK to issue USE <file> now !" NOWAIT

         ON ERROR
         *** release the ON ERROR statement

   NOTE: FoxPro does not open any files after the ON ERROR statement removes the
   reference. The user must issue the USE <file> command again to access
   the information in the .DBF file.
