SUMMARY
=======

Smart Alloc (SMART) allows programmers to experiment using the _fmalloc()
function in the Microsoft Windows operating system. It is a companion program
for the technical article in the MSDN "Allocating Memory the Old Fashioned Way:
malloc and Windows Applications."

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

   Smart.exe

With Smart Alloc and Heap Walker, programmers can interactively explore the
behavior of _fmalloc(), _ffree(), GlobalAlloc(), GlobalFree(), and _heapmin().
They can allocate memory either using GlobalAlloc() or _fmalloc(), or from a
DLL. They can determine when and how memory is allocated easily, without
recompiling.

The source code for Smart Alloc also demonstrates some interesting features.
Smart Alloc is a multiple-instance, large-model application when compiled with
Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0. Another interesting feature of Smart Alloc is that
it includes a dynamic link library (DLL) that intercepts all calls SMART.EXE
makes to GlobalAlloc(), GlobalReAlloc(), and GlobalFree().

Smart Alloc was built with Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 and tested under Microsoft
Windows version 3.1.
