The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Windows 3.1 StartUp group, applications load in left-to-right sequence,
with Windows-based applications taking precedence over MS-DOS- based
applications, regardless of the order in which they appear in the StartUp group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows 3.1 StartUp group starts Windows-based applications beginning with
the first icon in the group and moves from left to right, starting each
Windows-based application in the first line. It then moves down a line, if
applicable, and begins starting Windows-based applications in the same fashion.
Startup skips over any MS-DOS-based applications that are placed between the
Windows-based applications. If a switch appears on the command line for a
Windows-based application, then it will load after the other Windows-based
applications.

Startup then begins with the second MS-DOS-based application and moves from left
to right, skipping over the already running Windows-based applications. After
the last MS-DOS-based application in the StartUp group is started, startup goes
back and starts the first MS-DOS-based application.

If the StartUp group contains MS-DOS-based applications only, startup begins
loading the second application and does not start the first application in the
group until the last application has been started.
