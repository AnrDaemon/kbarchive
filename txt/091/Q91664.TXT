TITLE   :MS-DOS Backup Err Msg: Unable to Open Component File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.21,6.22

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you back up to a network drive, and someone moves your files, you cannot
restore them until they are moved back. When you try to restore your files, you
receive the following error message:

   Unable to open component file
   <drive:path:filename>

CAUSE
=====

If you back up to a fixed (not floppy) drive, Microsoft Backup creates a .001
file in a .FUL directory. For example, if you back up to F:\TEMP on your fixed
drive or a network drive, Backup creates

   f:\TEMP\DEFAULT\xxxxxxxx.FUL\xxxxxxxx.001

where xxxxxxxx are numbers and letters generated from the date. Moving the .001
file causes the restore option in Backup to fail and generates the error
message.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, re-create your original directory structure and
move the .001 file back to its original location. If you cannot remember the
original directory structure, attempt to restore your files again. The error
message displayed by Backup tells you the directory and filename for which it is
looking.

How the Backup Filename in Generated
------------------------------------

The backup file for DEFAULT\CCYMMDDA.FUL is calculated as follows:

   default = name of backup set
   y = last number of year
   mm = month of backup
   dd = day of backup
   a = A - Z, depending on the number backups that day
