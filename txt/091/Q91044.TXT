-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use Windows version 3.1 for Workgroups to create a workgroup
postoffice, Windows for Workgroups uses the values you assign to your computer
name and workgroup for your postoffice name and network name. Some characters
that are valid in the computer name and workgroup boxes are not valid for the
Postoffice and Network name fields in upgrading to the version 3.0 Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks postoffice. If you use an invalid character, you are
prompted to enter a new name for the corresponding field. Note that in this
case, your mail addresses will be invalidated. The invalid characters are:

   ~ ` ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ - + = { [ } ] | \ : ; " ' < , > . ? /

You should not change your computer name and workgroup name as part of the
upgrade procedure, as this will invalidate all mail addresses using the old
names. However, you can make this change by selecting Password from the
Configure menu in ADMIN.EXE.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10 admin
