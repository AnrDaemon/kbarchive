KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After upgrading to Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) from Windows version 3.0 or 3.1
with version 6.x of CO/Session installed, the following error message occurs
when you try to run Windows for Workgroups in enhanced mode:

   A device has been specified more than once in the SYSTEM.INI file or a device
   specified in SYSTEM.INI conflicts with a device which is being loaded by an
   MS-DOS device driver or application. Remove the duplicate entry from the
   SYSTEM.INI file and restart Windows.

CAUSE
=====

Both CO/Session and Windows for Workgroups install a virtual communications
driver (VxD). When Windows for Workgroups upgrades, it places a second VxD in
the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. Even though these drivers have
different filenames, Windows for Workgroups sees them as duplicates because they
are both virtual communications drivers.

CO/Session originally adds:

       DEVICE=CS$VCD.386

Windows for Workgroups upgrade then adds:

       DEVICE=VCD.386

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file with any text editor.

2. Locate the [386Enh] section and find lines similar to the following:

         DEVICE=CS$VCD.386
         DEVICE=VCD.386

   NOTE: The line may read DEVICE=VCD$CS.386

3. To enable the default Windows for Workgroups driver, insert a semicolon (;)
   at the beginning of the DEVICE=CS$VCD.386 line, as follows:

         ;DEVICE=CS$VCD.386

4. To enable the CO/Session driver, insert a semicolon (;) at the beginning of
   the DEVICE=VCD.386 line:

         ;DEVICE=VCD.386
