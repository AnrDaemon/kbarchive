======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The text shadow color in PowerPoint is not affected by the shadow color in the
slide color scheme.

If the slide background or text box fill color is other than white, and the text
color is anything but black, the text shadow color is black. If the text color
is black, the text shadow color is white.

CAUSE
=====

The color of a text shadow in PowerPoint is limited and dependent on the color
of the text and the Background color of the slide.

WORKAROUND
==========

PowerPoint 4.0 and 7.0
----------------------

Rather than using the text shadow effect from the Format Font dialog box or the
Text Shadow toolbar button, use the Shadow option on the Format menu.

1. Select the entire text object.

2. On the Format menu, click Shadow.

3. Select the desired shadow color in the Color box.

4. Set the offset variables to 3 points.

Using the Shadow option from the Format menu offers flexibility in the direction
of the shadow as well as the color. The Text Shadow option allows only a shadow
down and to the right.

PowerPoint 3.0
--------------

The color of a text shadow can be varied by changing the third position in the
Color Scheme, (available by clicking Color Scheme on the Slide menu) with the
following exceptions:

   Text                Background  Shadow
   --------------------------------------

   Black               Not white   White
   White               Not white   Black
   Any color           Not white   Black
   (other than
   black & white)

Object shadows are not affected by these conditions, and always follow the third
position of the Color Scheme for the slide to which the object shadow is
applied.
