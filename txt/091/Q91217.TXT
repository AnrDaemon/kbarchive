TITLE   :Remove Locator Service After Installing LM 2.1 3Com Tape
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

If you are using 3Servers and you are NOT running XNS on your network, remove
both XNS and the Locator Service after installing the LAN Manager 2.1 tape. XNS
is installed by default because it is required for the tape installation to
succeed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step 8 on page 3-5 of the "LAN Manager Installation and Configuration Guide for
3Servers" states:

   If you do not need XNS permanently, you can remove it with Remsetup, as
   described in the Microsoft LAN Manager Protocol Installation and
   Configuration Guide for 3Servers.

This documentation does not indicate that Remsetup will NOT remove the Locator
Service. Thus when you boot the machine, Locator will attempt to start and you
will receive error messages.

After removing XNS with Remsetup, follow the instructions on page 138 in the
"Microsoft Upgrade Toolkit for 3Com Networks" manual to remove or disable the
Locator Service.
