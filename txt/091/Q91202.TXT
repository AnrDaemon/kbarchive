TITLE   :Multiple Configuration Menu Is Not Displayed

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the MENUDEFAULT command in your CONFIG.SYS file is incorrectly set, the
time-out value defaults to zero. As a result, the startup menu is not displayed
when you start your machine.

Common problems with menudefault settings include using the full menu descriptor
(menu_text) instead of the menu block name and using non-numeric characters.

To determine if your menu default is incorrectly set, restart your computer and
press the F8 function key when the text "Starting MS-DOS..." is displayed. If
the time-out is defaulting to zero, the menu is displayed. If the menu is not
displayed, another problem exists.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Do not use more than one word for your block name. If you want to use text to
describe your menu options, use a one-word block name followed by the
description. For example, consider the following menu items:

   menuitem=dev, Development Configuration
   menuitem=wfwg, Windows for Workgroups
   menuitem=games, Games
   menuitem=files, Files and Buffers Only

   [dev]

   [wfwg]

   [games]

   [files]

For these menu items, the four default menu possibilities are "development,"
"wfwg," "games," and "files."

When you use the menudefault setting, do not include the descriptor text. For
example,

   menudefault=wfwg, 30

If you include the descriptor text, it is interpreted as the time-out setting.
Since it is non-numeric text, the menu is not displayed. For example, the
following menudefault line is incorrect:

  menudefault=wfwg, Windows for Workgroups, 30
