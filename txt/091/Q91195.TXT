Shipment Cover Letter Errors
----------------------------

The cover letter states the following:

   If you need an XNS network number, Microsoft Systems Support will be able to
   provide one for you.

This information is incorrect. Microsoft does not assign XNS network numbers. We
can refer you to the existing XNS network number assignment.


Number of Disks Shipped
-----------------------

In the bulleted section, it states that we are shipping five disks with this
package; this is incorrect. Only four disks are shipped:

 - 3Server Utility (1.44 MB)

 - Netstation Utility (1.44 MB)

 - LAN Manager Remote Access Service for 3Servers (1.44 MB)

 - LAN Manager Services for Macintosh Installation for 3Servers (720K)


Microsoft Does NOT Support 3COM 3Server Hardware
------------------------------------------------

The cover letter states:

   Microsoft is committed to supporting 3Com 3Server hardware at least through
   December 31, 1993.

Microsoft does not support 3Com 3Server hardware; we do support LAN Manager on
the 3Server platform. Customers must refer to 3Com for hardware support and
replacement parts.
