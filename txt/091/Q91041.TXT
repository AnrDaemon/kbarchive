SUMMARY
=======

To prepare for moving a workgroup postoffice (WGPO)
---------------------------------------------------

1. Pick a time when all users are off of Mail (usually after normal working
   hours) to move the WGPO.

2. Ask users to do the following:

   a. Update their mailboxes by choosing New Messages from the View menu.

   b. Choose Exit And Sign Out from the File menu before a specified time or
      before they leave for the day.

3. Create a shared directory for the postoffice. Different networks use
   different commands for setting up a server. If you are moving the WGPO to
   another computer on a Windows for Workgroups network, use the File Manager to
   create the directory, and use the Share As command from the Disk menu to
   share the directory.

To move a workgroup postoffice
------------------------------

1. Open the File Manager and select the WGPO directory.

2. From the File menu, choose Move. Move the WGPO directory by using the Windows
   File Manager. Do not use the MS-DOS COPY or XCOPY commands; these MS-DOS
   commands do not copy hidden files that need to be moved with the postoffice.

3. In the "To:" box, type the new path for the postoffice. Remember this path;
   you will use it when you run the Extend program.

4. Choose the OK button.
