KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Novell NetWare support, settings that you entered into the
NET.CFG file for customizing your NetWare configuration may be ignored.

CAUSE
=====

NETX.COM is running from the Windows for Workgroups directory and is not able to
find NET.CFG.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, copy NET.CFG to the Windows for Workgroups directory.
Also, make sure all NetWare commands in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file are run from the
Windows for Workgroups directory. For example:

   C:
   CD \WINDOWS
   C:\WINDOWS\NET START
   C:\WINDOWS\MSIPX
   C:\WINDOWS\NETX
