TITLE   :Network Setup Prompts for Disk; Doesn't Work if Mouse Present

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On certain configurations, installing Windows for Workgroups over the network
(using the SETUP /N command) causes the following message to appear after Setup
has switched into graphics mode:

   Please Insert Disk Labeled: Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Disk #3

After installation, everything appears to work correctly but commands accessing
the network ("NET USE", "DIR X:\" and so on) don't work.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a conflict between the network card and the mouse; both are
trying to use the same interrupt. Once Windows initialization starts in Setup
(graphics mode), so does the mouse, which is why the trouble begins there.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the mouse to a different port, change the
mouse interrupt if it's a bus mouse, or change the interrupt for the network
card.
