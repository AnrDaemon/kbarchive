======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer may stop responding (hang) after you remove your IBM Token Ring
adapter if you have installed Novell NetWare as a secondary network in Windows
for Workgroups. When you start your computer, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file processes
successfully until it reaches the NET START command. It displays the following
message:

   Microsoft NetBind version 2.1

Your computer then hangs. To start your computer and gain access to your hard
drive, you must use a bootable floppy.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, remove the network device driver statements from the
CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are not using an IBM Token Ring adapter or have not installed Novell
NetWare as your secondary network, you may receive errors after removing your
network adapter. During CONFIG.SYS processing, the following displays:

   MAC0006: Network interface hardware not found or not responding.

   MAC0001: Init failure
   Press any key to continue...

Once you press a key and the AUTOEXEC.BAT file begins processing, the following
is displayed:

   Error 5733: The protocol manager has reported an incomplete binding.

Although these errors do not prevent you from using your computer, they may be
signs of an unstable configuration. Microsoft recommends that you remove the
network device drivers from CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT until your network
adapter is back in your computer.
