Windows for Workgroups File Manager is extensible, meaning dynamic-link
libraries (DLLs) can be added. You can access DLL options from toolbar
icons or add-on menus. The maximum number of DLLs that can be added to File
Manager is four toolbar or menu items and the Undelete DLL (five total).

DLLs are added to File Manager by adding entries to the [AddOns] section of
WINFILE.INI. No errors are generated if there are more than five entries.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11
