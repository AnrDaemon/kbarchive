TITLE   :Network Dysfunctional After Removing Novell NetBIOS Support

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You remove Novell NetBIOS support from your Windows for Workgroups network, and
now you have no network functionality.

CAUSE
=====

To support Novell NetBIOS, you must add two statements to the SYSTEM.INI file.
If you then remove Novell NetBIOS support, Control Panel does not remove the
statements, resulting in no network functionality.

WORKAROUND
==========

To regain network functionality, you must manually remove these lines if they
exist:

      V86ModeLANAs=0,1
      LANAs=0,1

MORE INFORMATION
================

Adding the two statements to your SYSTEM.INI is necessary to make the Windows
for Workgroups network redirector ignore the Novell NetBIOS provider on LANA0.
If you later remove Novell NetBIOS support, Control Panel moves NetBEUI support
back to LANA0, but does not remove the statements, making the redirector ignore
LANA0. Because the redirector cannot find a valid NetBIOS provider, it cannot
load.

You can find instructions for Novell NetBIOS support in the NETWORKS.WRI file in
the Windows for Workgroups directory.
