TITLE   :FIX: H2INC Version 1.0 Ignores /G3 and /G4 Option Switches
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:OS/2:1.0; winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 1.0 of the H2INC utility, provided with Microsoft Macro Assembler
(MASM) version 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b, the /G3 or /G4 option switch does not change
the size of an int from a WORD to a DWORD.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in H2INC version 1.0. This problem
was corrected in H2INC for MS-DOS version 1.1 which is included with MASM for
MS-DOS version 6.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Pages 436 and 440 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler Programmer's Guide" for MASM
version 6.0 document the /G3 and /G4 switches for the H2INC utility. As note
above, H2INC version 1.0 does not implement these switches.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Command line options needed: /G3
   */ 
   int my_var;

   ; Resulting .INC file
   EXTERNDEF C my_var:SWORD    /* Notice it is not :SDWORD */ 

Additional query words: 6.00 6.00a 6.00b 1.00 buglist1.00 fixlist1.10
