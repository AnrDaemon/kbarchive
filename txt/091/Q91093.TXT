SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from Quattro Pro to a NetWare Print Server using a network queue,
the print job may fail. The print output may be written to the video screen.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the error handling in Quattro Pro. If an error is
reported when it tries to open the NetWare print queue (NETQ), it sends the
print output to the wrong file handle, which can be the video screen.

Additional query words: wfw 3.10
