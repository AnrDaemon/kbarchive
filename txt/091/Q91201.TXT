KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the installation of Windows for Workgroups (WFWG), there is no warning
that the SUN PC-NFS network operating system is not supported.


CAUSE
=====

Versions of the SUN PC-NFS network prior to version 5.0 are not supported by
Windows for Workgroups version 3.1. If the references to the SUN client software
are not removed before rebooting, the system may stop responding (hang) as the
conflicting network device drivers attempt to load.

Normally, Windows for Workgroups issues a warning during setup if the currently
installed networking software is not compatible with Windows for Workgroups.
Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 setup is not able to detect the presence of a
PC-NFS network.

WORKAROUND
==========

To run Windows for Workgroups properly on a SUN PC-NFS workstation, remove all
references to PC-NFS connectivity from the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files or
upgrade to PC-NFS version 5.0.

For more information on running PC-NFS version 5.0 with Windows for Workgroups
version 3.1, query on the following words here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Sun and PC-NFS and 5.0 and NDIS


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1. This problem does not occur in later versions of Windows for Workgroups as
later versions support PC-NFS.
