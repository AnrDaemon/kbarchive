The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Workgroup Connections Setup, if you select "Do not run Workgroup
Connections," the AUTOSTART= statement is left blank in SYSTEM.INI. If you
execute a NET command requiring a loaded network redirector, NET.EXE should load
the full redirector by default, regardless of the NET command. Depending on what
command you execute, NET.EXE may not load the full redirector.


NET LOGON and NET START RDR both require network redirectors. If no redirector is
loaded or specified by the AUTOSTART= statement, NET.EXE should load the full
redirector. However, if you execute NET LOGON, NET.EXE loads the full
redirector; if you execute NET START RDR, it loads the basic redirector.
