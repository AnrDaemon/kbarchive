SYMPTOMS
========

With Workgroup Connections or Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS installed for the
basic or full redirector, the NET START command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
produces the following error message when you are using a COMPAQ 32-bit
DualSpeed Token Ring card and a Proteon 1990 card:

   Error #5, access denied.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, replace the "net start" line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file with the following lines.

   net start netbind
   pause
   net start netbeui
   net start full (or basic)

You can achieve the same results by typing the following at the command line:

   net stop netbeui
   net start netbeui
   net start full (or basic)
