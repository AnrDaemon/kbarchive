SUMMARY
=======

QuarterDeck's QEMM LASTDRIVE program is incompatible with Windows for
Workgroups.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you try to add drive letters using QEMM's LASTDRIVE program, Windows for
Workgroups connects the drive but doesn't show any directory entries or file
information. Also, if you run MS-DOS Prompt, you can't switch to the connected
drive.

NOTE: The MS-DOS LASTDRIVE= statement in the CONFIG.SYS file works correctly.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11
