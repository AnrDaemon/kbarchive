The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Because of limitations in the SMB protocol, some file operations between
machines with different code pages on the same network may not work correctly.
This results in character misinterpretations and file access problems.

CAUSE
=====

The SMB protocol does not have the ability to transmit client code pages to the
server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, make sure all the machines on the network are using the
same code page. Because these problems usually result from the use of extended
ASCII characters, using standard ASCII characters (ASCII codes less than 128) in
filenames can also help.
