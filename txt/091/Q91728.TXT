MORE INFORMATION
================

For definitions of terms used in this article, please see the DoubleSpace Help.

DBLSPACE.BIN
------------

MS-DOS uses the DBLSPACE.BIN component to mount the compressed volume file so you
can access the files on your compressed drive. This file loads automatically if
it is in the root directory of the startup disk (no device= line is needed). If
you want to load DBLSPACE.BIN into upper memory, see the DBLSPACE.SYS section of
this article.

DBLSPACE.EXE
------------

This file allows you to mount, create or modify DoubleSpace drives. DoubleSpace
accepts the following parameters:

DBLSPACE /CHKDSK [/F] [drive:]
DBLSPACE /COMPRESS drive: [/F] [/NEWDRIVE=drive2:] [/RESERVE=size]
DBLSPACE /CREATE drive: [/NEWDRIVE=drive2:] [/SIZE=size | /RESERVE=size]
DBLSPACE /DEFRAGMENT [/F] [drive:]
DBLSPACE /DELETE drive:
DBLSPACE /FORMAT drive:
DBLSPACE [/INFO] drive:
DBLSPACE /LIST
DBLSPACE /MOUNT[=sss] [drive:] [/NEWDRIVE=drive2:]
DBLSPACE /RATIO[=r.r] [drive: | /ALL]
DBLSPACE /SIZE[=size | /RESERVE=size] [drive:]
DBLSPACE /UNMOUNT [drive:]

For more information about DoubleSpace command-line options, type "HELP DBLSPACE"
(without the quotation marks) or "HELP DBLSPACE /switchname" (without the
quotation marks) (where /switchname is the name of the switch about which you
want more information) at the command prompt.

DBLSPACE.HLP
------------

This file contains help on DoubleSpace. To access this file, run DoubleSpace and
choose Contents or Index from the Help menu.

DBLSPACE.INF
------------

The DoubleSpace Setup information file is helpful when creating a new DoubleSpace
drive, but it is not required.

Commands under the [SpecialFiles] section indicate actions to be taken for
specific files; the possible actions are COPY=, IGNORE= and MOVE=. Without a
path, any file of that name will match; wild cards (?, *) are acceptable.

Programs under the [CopyFiles] section are optional utilities that are left on
the original boot drive if there is enough room.

Programs under the [dangerous] section will be remarked out using the REM command
from CONFIG.SYS file during DoubleSpace Setup but will not be remarked after
Setup has completed.

Programs under the [prior] section will have DEVICEHIGH=DBLSPACE.SYS placed ABOVE
them in the CONFIG.SYS file.

DBLSPACE.INI
------------

This file is used by DoubleSpace to mount the compressed volume and swap drive
letters. The file contains the following settings:

   MaxRemovableDrives=
   FirstDrive=
   LastDrive=
   MaxFileFragments=
   ActivateDrive=

DBLSPACE.WIN
------------

This is a temporary file that DBLSPACE.BIN generates to keep track of windows
information when a drive is compressed. It should automatically be deleted after
DBLSPACE.BIN completes the compression of the existing drive.

DBLSPACE.SYS
------------

The DBLSPACE.SYS device driver does not provide access to the compressed drives,
but it does provide the following functionality:

 - Allows DBLSPACE.BIN to be loaded high (using the devicehigh command)

 - Moves DBLSPACE.BIN from the top of conventional memory to the bottom (as
   device drivers load). This can eliminate conflicts with programs that require
   access to the top of conventional memory.

DBLSPACE.00x
------------

A compressed drive is not a real disk drive, although it appears that way to most
programs. Instead, a compressed drive exists on your disk as a hidden file
called a compressed volume file (CVF). DBLSPACE.00x is the compressed volume
file.
