======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may see the following incorrect error message when you start the Windows
client of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, after you install both it and the
Presentation Manager client for OS/2 on a system that boots both MS- DOS and
OS/2:

   Mail will not run because someone has tampered with the program files. Check
   your machine for viruses and run setup to reinstall Mail.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program for both clients stamps MSMAIL.EXE and changes the size of the
file. This causes the program to think that it has been infected with a virus.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the Windows and Presentation Manager clients in two separate
directories.
