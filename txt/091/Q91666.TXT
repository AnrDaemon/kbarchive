SUMMARY
=======

When you format a disk in File Manager, the Label field in the Format Disk
dialog box may not allow you to enter a full eleven-character disk label because
Windows uses a proportional font for this field. If you choose a wide character,
such as a "w," you may only be able to fit eight characters in the field.

If you cannot enter the necessary disk label, use the MS-DOS LABEL command to
change the disk label after you have formatted the disk.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows and Windows for
Workgroups 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.
