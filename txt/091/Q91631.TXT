SUMMARY
=======

The README.TXT file included with LapLink Pro version 4.0A, an MS-DOS-based
application manufactured by Traveling Software, recommends not running LapLink
under Microsoft Windows. This file also states that LapLink Pro 4.0A can
function in 386 enhanced mode if you comment out the lines Device=*VCD and
Device=*Combuff in the SYSTEM.INI file to disable the virtual communications
driver (VCD) and virtual communications buffer (Combuff). To comment out these
line, place a semicolon at the beginning of each line as follows:

      ;Device=*VCD
      ;Device=*Combuff

Running Windows 3.1 with these lines disabled can cause problems when you are
running other applications that use the COM ports. Microsoft does not support
this workaround supplied by Traveling Software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In 386 enhanced mode, the VCD allows multiple applications to access COM port
hardware at the same time. The VCD notifies virtual machines (VMs) when their
COM ports require servicing. Combuff buffers data between the communications
driver and physical port. This prevents multitasking applications from losing
data when they do not currently have CPU time.

If you run LapLink Pro 4.0A in 386 enhanced mode by making the aforementioned
changes, your mouse response may become jumpy and your system may stop
responding (hang).

LapLink Pro is manufactured by Traveling Software, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
