TITLE   :Persistent Network Connections in WIN.INI Must Be Uppercase
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Persistent network connections are written to the [MRU_Files] and [MRU_Printers]
sections of the WIN.INI file. If the entries in these sections are not
uppercase, persistent connections to Novell servers or printers are not
reestablished.

CAUSE
=====

NETWARE.DRV relies on uppercase letters for persistent network connections. If
you have edited the WIN.INI file and changed these settings using lowercase
characters, the connections will not be reestablished when you restart the
system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups
NETWARE.DRV version 3.1. This problem does not occur in later versions of the
product.

Additional query words: 3.10
