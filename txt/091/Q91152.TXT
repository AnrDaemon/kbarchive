The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you perform a network installation of Windows for Workgroups (using the SETUP
/N command), the following error message may be displayed when you attempt to
start Windows for Workgroups:

   One or more files could not be found that were needed to start Windows in
   enhanced or standard mode.

With a local installation, you would get a list of files that it could not find,
but in this case the list is empty.

CAUSE
=====

This message occurs when a network connection to the shared Windows for
Workgroups directory has not been established, and WIN.COM cannot find the files
it needs to start Windows for Workgroups.

RESOLUTION
==========

To solve this problem, start the redirector, log on, and connect to the server
containing the shared Windows for Workgroups directory.
