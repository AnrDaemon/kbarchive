TITLE   :PRB: Empty Segments in Program Overlay, Empty MOVE.TRC File

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 5.3, 5.31.009, 5.5, 5.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using LINK version 5.3 and above, an application created with the MOVE overlay
syntax is not recognized to contain overlays. Each segment specified in the
SEGMENTS statement in the module definition (DEF) file is empty. In a tracing
version of the application, the trace file, MOVE.TRC, is also empty.

CAUSE
=====

When the /Gy compiler option switch is specified, the compiler places the code
for each module into segments named comdat_segN, where N is assigned successive
integer values as segments fill up. The linker creates empty segments of the
form modulename_text and places them into the specified overlays. Because each
of the overlays is empty, the MOVE.TRC file produced by the tracing version of
the overlaid program is also empty.

RESOLUTION
==========

Perform one of the following two methods to avoid this situation:

 - Specify the overlays in the DEF file using the FUNCTIONS statement instead of
   the SEGMENTS statement. Function code is placed in the appropriate
   comdat_segN segment in the overlay.

 - Remove the /Gy option switch from the compiler command line.
