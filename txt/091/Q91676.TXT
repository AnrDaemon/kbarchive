SUMMARY
=======

TV Link is a device that allows users to connect their computers to television
and video tape hardware. Any computer configured with a VGA compatible output
device may use TV Link's ability to output to RCA, S-3, or RGB type outputs.

There are some display drivers for Microsoft Windows that ship on disks with the
product; however, the use of these drivers is not required.

MORE INFORMATION
================

TV Link loads one terminate-and-stay-resident program (TSR), TVLINK.COM, in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. This TSR allows any 640 x 480 display with any number of
colors to be displayed on your television. TV Link can unload TVLINK.COM by
running UNTVLINK.EXE. Both programs are on a disk included with the unit.

TV Link digitizes the VGA output of the computer. Any VGA or SVGA resolution at
640 x 480 pixels (and up to 16 million colors) can be input by the unit. It is
the use of Digital Signal Processing that allows the VGA output to be
manipulated with minimal distortion.

TV Link is manufactured by KDI, Inc. For more information regarding this product,

TV Link is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
