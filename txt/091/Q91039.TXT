KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Extensions for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run version 3.0 of Extensions for Windows for Workgroups on a Windows
version 3.1 for Workgroups postoffice, the network name is not displayed in the
Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) under External- Admin. This is because
the NETWORK.GLB file has yet to be created.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Extensions for Windows for
Workgroups, version 3.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create the NETWORK.GLB file to reflect the current network listing:

1. From within ADMIN.EXE, select Password from the Configure menu.

2. Press the UP ARROW once, and then press ENTER four times.

The network name now displays correctly.
