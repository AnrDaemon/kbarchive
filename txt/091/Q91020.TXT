TITLE   :Shared WFWG Directory on Novell NetWare Server Is Disconnected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows for Workgroups from a shared network directory (created by
using the SETUP /A command), File Manager allows you to disconnect the network
drive from which you are running Windows for Workgroups, without a warning, when
the shared directory is on a Novell NetWare server.

When you run a SETUP /N configuration with Windows 3.1, this is not possible. The
NetWare dialog in Windows 3.1 does not allow you to disconnect a search drive.

With Windows for Workgroups, you can disconnect any network drive, even when it's
a NetWare search drive.

If you disconnect the network drive from which Windows for Workgroups is running,
the machine may stop responding (hang).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1 and version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.10 wfwg 3.11
