TITLE   :Obtain LOGSHOW/VIEWCFG Info Without Installing MS OS/2
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft OS/2 for LAN Manager Servers (the OS/2 included in the LAN Manager 2.1
box) is a unique version of OS/2 in the way that it provides device support for
hard-disk controllers. Microsoft uses LADDR (Layered Device Driver Architecture)
for interacting with controllers.

LOGSHOW is a utility that provides information about the way LADDR recognizes a
system's hardware. VIEWCFG is a utility that displays which LADDR support files
(BID files for example) have loaded themselves into memory. It is often easy to
determine if the files loaded are actively being used. This article describes
how to obtain LADDR information without having to install MS OS/2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Boot off of the Microsoft LAN Manager - Installation Disk A or the Microsoft
   LAN Manager - HPFS Recover Disk 1.

2. If you are using Installation Disk A, press ESC when the first Installation
   screen appears.

3. Put the Systems Support Disk in the drive, and run LOGSHOW.EXE or
   VIEWCFG.EXE.

4. If running LOGSHOW, press F3 to "Show and Discard Unlogged Events."

If there is no controller information present, or VDISK version 1.3 establishes
itself as Disk C (in the case where the OS/2 Setup disk is used), you may want
to change the first step to:

1. Boot off of the Microsoft LAN Manager - Installation Disk B, or the Microsoft
   LAN Manager - HPFS Recover Disk 2.
