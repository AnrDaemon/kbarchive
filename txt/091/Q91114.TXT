TITLE   :WFWG Err Msg: NET3651: There Is No Protocol Added...

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft LAN Manager directory is in the MS-DOS PATH statement before
the Windows for Workgroups directory, you receive the following error message:

   NET3651: There is no protocol loaded. A protocol is required to complete the
   command.

To avoid this error and retain network functionality in Windows for Workgroups,
remove the LAN Manager from the PATH statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

CAUSE
=====

Windows for Workgroups Setup looks for a PATH statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
and removes the LAN Manager directory. If the syntax of the PATH statement has
been changed, Setup fails to recognize it and does not remove the LAN Manager
directory.

Setup recognizes

   SET PATH=C:\DOS;C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG;C:\WINDOWS

However, it does not recognize:

   PATH C:\DOS;C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG;C:\WINDOWS

When the NET START command is executed from AUTOEXEC.BAT, LAN Manager's NET
command is activated, causing the above error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1 and version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11
