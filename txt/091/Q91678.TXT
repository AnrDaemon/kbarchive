-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If SMARTDrive version 4.0 is running, and MicroSolutions' BackPack is run from
MS-DOS or under Windows or Windows for Workgroups, you receive the following
error message:

   Read Fault Error

NOTE: BackPack is an external floppy drive made by MicroSolutions.

CAUSE
=====

MicroSolutions' technical support has confirmed that attempting to access drive
B with BackPack does not work on a system in which SMARTDrive version 4.0 is
loaded.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are three possible solutions to this problem:

 - Upgrade to BackPack version 2.09. For more information, contact
   MicroSolutions.


   -or

 - Do not choose the drive B option for BackPack. Allow MS-DOS to assign the
   next available drive letter to the BackPack drive. Rerun BACKPREP as
   described in section 2.2 of the "BackPack User's Guide." When prompted for
   whether you want BackPack installed as drive B, respond with "N". This will
   assign BackPack the next available drive letter. See section 3.1 of the
   "BackPack User's Guide" for more information on this procedure.

   -or-

 - Do not use SMARTDRV.EXE. Locate the line in AUTOEXEC.BAT that references
   SMARTDRV.EXE and delete that line. This allows BackPack to operate as drive
   B, but disk caching will not be available.

For additional information, contact MicroSolutions technical support.

The BackPack external disk drive is manufactured by MicroSolutions, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
