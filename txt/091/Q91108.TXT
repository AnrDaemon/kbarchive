======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows for Workgroups Setup and Control Panel make backup copies of
PROTOCOL.INI whenever changes are made. These backup files are named PROTOCOL,
with incremental numeric file extensions that are added as each new backup is
created. However, if the Windows for Workgroups directory name has a file
extension, the PROTOCOL.INI backup file is named after the Windows directory and
located one level higher in the directory structure. For example, if the Windows
for Workgroups directory was named C:\WINDOWS.WFW, the PROTOCOL.INI backup would
be named WINDOWS.000 and stored in the root of drive C.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1. This problem does not occur in later versions of the product.

Additional query words: 3.10
