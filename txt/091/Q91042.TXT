-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you use Extensions for Windows for Workgroups to upgrade a Windows version
3.1 for Workgroups postoffice to a version 3.0 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
postoffice, it is not possible to access the Mail Administrator program from
within Mail for Windows.

Before the Windows for Workgroups postoffice was upgraded, the Mail Administrator
program could be accessed from the Mail menu within Mail for Windows. After the
upgrade, if you select the Postoffice Manager command from the Mail menu, the
following error message appears:

   The ServerPath entry in your MSMAIL.INI file is missing or doesn't contain
   the pathname of a valid Workgroup Postoffice.

As in the retail version of Microsoft Mail, it is expected that the Mail
administrator log in from MS-DOS, using ADMIN.EXE.

the following steps:

1. From the File menu in Microsoft Mail, choose Exit And Sign-Out.

   0;;Manage Workgroup Postoffice;MSMAIL.HLP;2870

4. Save the changes to the MSMAIL.INI file.
