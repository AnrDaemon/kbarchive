KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Extensions for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Upgrade for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Extensions for Windows
for Workgroups or version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Upgrade for
Windows for Workgroups to upgrade a Windows for Workgroups postoffice to a
version 3.0 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice, you receive this prompt:

   Install Enhanced Security (Y/N)

If you select "N," a second prompt appears:

   Uninstall previously Enhanced Security (Y/N)

RESOLUTION
==========

Select "N." This question is not applicable because the Windows for Workgroups
postoffice initially does not use enhanced security.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail
and Schedule+ Extensions for Windows for Workgroups or version 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail and Schedule+ Upgrade for Windows for Workgroups. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
