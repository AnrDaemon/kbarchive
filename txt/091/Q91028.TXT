Whenever you use the Network setup option of Microsoft Windows Setup
to add or remove Novell NetWare connectivity from Windows for
Workgroups, TBMI2.COM is removed from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. TBMI2.COM
does not cause any problems with Windows for Workgroups and can be
added back to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

TBMI2.COM acts as an interface between NetWare and the standard mode
Windows task switcher.
