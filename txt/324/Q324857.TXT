SUMMARY
=======

The following are the necessary steps to install MSN 5.6 on Windows 95 and
later:

1. Connect using a MSN Explorer dial-up connection.

2. Once connected, launch Internet Explorer.

3. In Internet Explorer, go to
   http://fdl.msn.com/public/msnqfe/components/us/msn56.exe.

4. In the File Download dialog box, click Run this program from its current
   location, and then click OK.
   This extracts the EXE file and launches a new browser window that points to
   the secure site https://migration.msn.com/upgrade56.
   If prompted with any Security Alert dialog boxes, about viewing pages over a
   secure connection click OK.

5. In the Explorer User Prompt dialog box, type your MSN Member ID, and then
   click OK. Do NOT enter a domain name. For example, if your Member ID is
   yourname@msn.com, type "yourname".

6. Proceed through the migration web pages as usual. Do not interrupt the
   migration process.

7. When the upgrade is complete, the computer disconnects from the internet, and
   Logon Manager launches. If prompted, enter your password.

8. Click Sign-in to begin the poptimization process. Complete this process
   before proceeding to the next step.

9. In the Control Panel, double-click the following, depending on the version of
   Windows the computer is running:
    - Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me - Dial-Up Networking.

    - Windows 2000 - Network and Dial-up Connections.

    - Windows XP - Network and Internet Connections, and then click Set up or
      change your Internet connection.

10. In the Properties dialog box, remove ONLY the Temp connection (this was
   created in Step 2). Do not remove the "MSN Internet Access" connection.
