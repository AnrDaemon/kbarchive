SYMPTOMS
========

When certain error conditions are met, IIS files may be exposed to clients who
browse the Web site if you are using the XSL ISAPI filter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you must download and install a new filter.

1. Determine which version of the XSL ISAPI filter you are currently using, and
   then download the new filter from one of the following locations:

Note that it is extremely important to note which version is being used in IIS.
If you are not sure, review the documentation that is located on the download
page of the filter. The extensible nature of the filter makes it possible to
apply the wrong update to your version type.

    - If you are running any version from Reference Architecture for Commerce
      Version 2, download the new filter from the following Microsoft Developer
      Network (MSDN) Web site:

NOTE: The Reference Architecture for Commerce is an update to a previous release
named "B2C Reference Architecture". Users of both Reference Architectures must
download the update from this Web site.

   Reference Architecture for Commerce Version 2
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/code/default.asp?url=/code/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/026/002/422/msdncompositedoc.xml

    - If you are running any other version, download the new filter from the
      following MSDN Web site:

   XSL ISAPI Filter 2.2: Server-side XSL Formatting for Multiple Device Types
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnxslgen/html/xslisapifilter.asp

2. Click Start, click Programs, click Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, click Internet
   Information Server, and then click Internet Services Manager.

3. When the ISM opens, right-click the server name, and then click Properties to
   open the Master Properties dialog box.

4. In the Master Properties dialog box, make sure that WWW is listed in the
   drop-down list, and then click Edit.

5. On the ISAPI Filters tab, make sure that the XSL ISAPI filter is listed. The
   filter is installed and updated by the installer.

6. Stop and restart the service to activate the changes.

NOTE: Although no known compatibility issues exist between earlier versions,
Microsoft recommends that you install and fully test the new XSL ISAPI version
in a non-production environment before you use it in a production environment.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in IIS versions 4.0 and 5.0 and
MSXML versions 2.5, 2.6, 3.0.
