Page 11: Main Method Public Definition Incorrect
------------------------------------------------

On page 11, the last sentence of the first paragraph in the section "The Main
Method", the statement "In addition, this method must be defined as public and
static" is incorrect and should be removed.

The main method is private by default and does not need to be defined as public.
