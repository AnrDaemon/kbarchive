MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 13: Missing Three Steps In Exercise
----------------------------------------

There are three steps missing from the top of page 13. The following three steps
should be inserted at the top of the page:

"3.  Open Order.aspx in HTML mode by double-clicking on the filename in Solution
Explorer and then using the buttons in the lower left corner of the file?s
working window to toggle between Design mode and HTML mode.

4.  Modify the Inherits attribute in the .aspx file?s header to read
Commerce.Order. After the Web project has been set up, switch Order.aspx back to
Design mode so you can add some controls to the Web Form.

5.  Open the Toolbox, and add the following Web Form controls onto the Web Form?s
design surface by double-clicking each control: label, text box, calendar
control, and button."

The existing step 3 at the top of page 13 should be renumbered to step 6.


Page 23: Error In WebFileUtil Code Sample
-----------------------------------------

There is an error in the code sample on page 23.

Change:

   string source = args[1];
   string destination = source;

To:

   string source = "";
   string destination = "";
   if (args.Length == 2)
   {
         source = args[1];
         destination = source;
   }


Page 337: Warning Event Should Be Error Event
---------------------------------------------

There is an error in paragraph 3 on page 337.

Change:
"This code writes a warning event to the Application Log."

To:
"This code writes an error event to the Application Log."


Page 355: Error Regarding Failover Cluster
------------------------------------------

There is an error in the Highly Available Scale-Up Resources section on page
355.

Change:
"To achieve high scalability for a resource hosted on a single server, you can
use a failover cluster."

To:
"To achieve high availability for a resource hosted on a single server, you can
use a failover cluster."
