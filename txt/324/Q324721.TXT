 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a Systems Management Server (SMS) advertisement to run Clitravl.exe
to set or modify Travel mode on SMS clients, the advertisement return a "failed"
status even if Clitravl.exe runs successfully.

CAUSE
=====

Clitravl.exe returns error code 1 even if it runs successfully. You can confirm
this by verifying that the Travel mode properties are selected on the clients
and that the advertisement status is "failed."

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior and to cause the correct status to be returned, you
can run Clitravl.exe from a batch file to detect and set the return status. This
is a sample batch file:

   clitravl.exe /TRAVEL=ON
   if errorlevel 1 exit 0

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Clitravl.exe returns the following values when you run it:

 - Clitravl.exe returns 1 if Travel mode was already on or was just turned on.

 - Clitravl.exe returns 0 if Travel mode was already turned off or was just
   turned off.

 - Clitravl.exe returns -1 if an error occurs.
