The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When using <SCRIPT RUNAT="SERVER"></SCRIPT> tags instead of or in
addition to <% %> tags to denote Active Server Pages (ASP) code in a page,
the processing of ASP code may appear to be out of order.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. ASP code in <SCRIPT> tags is processed after
the end of the page's HTML information, whereas ASP code in <% %> tags is
processed in-line.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following examples will illustrate this behavior.

 - Save the following script as "Test1.asp" (without the quotation marks) in a
   folder with at least "script" access defined:

   <html>
   <body>
   <script runat="server" language="vbscript">
       Response.Write "<p>Line 1</p>"
   </script>
   <p>Line 2</p>
   </body>
   </html>

   Browsing this page will output the following HTML:

   <html>
   <body>
   <p>Line 2</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   <p>Line 1</p>

   The HTML output would seem at first glance to be out of order based on the
   location of the script inside the page.

 - Save this next script as "Test2.asp" (without the quotation marks) in the
   same folder as for the previous example:

   <% @language="vbscript" %>
   <html>
   <body>
   <%
       Response.Write "<p>Line 1</p>"
   %>
   <p>Line 2</p>
   </body>
   </html>

   Browsing this page will output the following HTML:

   <html>
   <body>
   <p>Line 1</p>
   <p>Line 2</p>
   </body>
   </html>

   So, if you use <SCRIPT> tags for ASP, they process after the page has
   processed, whereas <% %> tags execute in-line. This can lead to
   confusion, as shown in the following scenario.

 - Save this page as "Test3.asp" (without the quotation marks) in the same
   folder as earlier:

   <script runat="server" language="vbscript">
       strText = "<p>Line 1</p>"
   </script>
   <html>
   <body>
   <%
       Response.Write strText
   %>
   <p>Line 2</p>
   </body>
   </html>

   Browsing this page will output the following HTML:

   <html>
   <body>
   <p>Line 2</p>
   </body>
   </html>

   The text "Line 1" is not output because the variable "strText" will not be
   populated until after the Response.Write has already been executed.
