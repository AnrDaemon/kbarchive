TITLE   :XFOR: Event ID 2003 Displays the Wrong Destination Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Service has Message Delivery
configured for Forward all messages to host on the Connections tab and
Diagnostics Logging is set to any level other than None for the SMTP Interface
Events, you will receive the following event in the Event Viewer Application
Log:

   Event ID: 2003
   Source: MSExchangeIMC
   Category: SMTP Interface Events
   Description: A new TCP/IP connection has been made to host x.x.x.x (for
   domain.com).
   Logfile: L0000000.LOG

All messages sent out through the Internet Mail Service show the same domain name
in the description.

If SMTP Protocol Log is also turned on, the event listed above will display the
name of the log file where this SMTP transaction was recorded. This can be found
in the \exchsrvr\imcdata\log folder. If SMTP Protocol Log is set to None the
value for Logfile in this event will display None.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
5.5.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The domain that is displayed in each of these Success Audit events will remain
the same until the Internet Mail Service is stopped and restarted. At that point
the domain name for the first piece of mail that is forwarded to the specified
host on the Connections tab will be used for each new Success Audit event 2003.
This process will continue each time the Internet Mail Service is restarted.
This will not cause problems with mail flow and can be ignored. The IP address
portion of the event description should be correct for the host that is
responsible for relaying the outbound SMTP mail.
