SUMMARY

When you use Outlook Web Access (OWA), you may choose to remove the Change
Password button under Options in the OWA client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Removing the Change Password button requires you to edit the Set.Asp file
located in the Exchsrvr\Webdata\Usa\Options folder on the OWA server. To do so:

1. Locate the Set.Asp file, and open it in Notepad.

2. Remove the following section from the file, and save the new Set.Asp file

   if fEnablePasswordMenu then
      ' Get the Server name.  This is required for calling the password
      ' change form using https.
    
      thisServersName = Request.ServerVariables("SERVER_NAME")
    
      ' Get the IIS Version Number.  Password changing is only supported
      ' in version 4 or greater.
    
        soft =  Request.ServerVariables("SERVER_SOFTWARE")
        posver = Instr(soft, "/")
        serverVersion = CInt(right(soft, len(soft)-posver))
   end if

3. Start the browser on the OWA server. The Change Password button no longer
   appears.
