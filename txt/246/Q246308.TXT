SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to perform Win32 back ups on Interix.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is possible to start a command-line Win32 backup program through Interix by
using Cron.

IMPORTANT: This method is not recommended because Win32 files can have many
different levels of security. Interix recognizes all levels of security but may
not be able to properly back them up. This is because the Interix utilities are
built in UNIX and can only store the three sets of permissions that would be
displayed using the "ls -l" (without the quotation marks) command. Win32 backup
programs are able to store the complete set of permissions on a file and operate
correctly on Interix files.
