SUMMARY
=======

For troubleshooting purposes, it may become necessary to increase or decrease
the number of tracking log files for mail in Microsoft Exchange Server. This
article describes how to adjust this number.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

The following registry key can be modified to change the number of days covered
by the tracking log:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA\Parameters\OldLogsCleaningInterval(Days):
   Reg_DWORD: 0x7

By changing the OldLogsCleaningInterval(Days) value, you can increase or decrease
the number of tracking log files for that Exchange Server computer.
