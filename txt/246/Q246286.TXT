SYMPTOMS
========

While you are installing Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, the installation process
may halt when Setup attempts to stop the System Attendant service. The following
error messages may appear:

   The requested control is not valid for this service.
   Microsoft Windows NT ID NO: 0xc002041c

   Microsoft Exchange Server was interrupted before the new software was fully
   installed. You can run Exchange setup in its entirety at another time.

When you try to stop the service manually, the following error message may
appear:

   The requested pause or stop is not valid for this service.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, completely remove and then reinstall Exchange
Server.
