TITLE   :XCLN: Private Calendar Items Not Showing for Secondary Mailbox
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::8.04; WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.04 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have Microsoft Outlook configured to open a secondary calendar when
Outlook starts, calendar appointments marked as private are not visible. A small
blue line that indicates the time slot of the meeting is displayed, but there
appears to be no meeting on the Calendar.

In Outlook 2000, the appointment appears on the Calendar, but it is a private
appointment and you are not able to get details.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot view private appointments unless you have the proper permissions.
Typically, you are assigned Delegate Access permissions to a user, rather than
being listed as one of the Primary Windows NT Accounts associated with this
mailbox.

If you view items in another mailbox with Delegate Access permissions, you do not
have permissions to view the private items of the other mailbox. You are
considered a delegate looking at another user's mailbox.

To assign permissions in Outlook 2000:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the Delegates tab.

3. In the Delegates list, click the delegate in question, and then click
   Permissions.

4. Click to select the "Delegate can see my private appointments" check box.

5. Click OK twice.

When you use Outlook 97 and 98, delegates are not able to see private items for
another user unless they are the owner of that mailbox.
