TITLE   :Localstart.asp Not Display Browsing Local Computer With Netscape
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000 kbIIS kbiis500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Netscape Navigator or Communicator to browse the default Web page on
the local computer, the Localstart.asp page is not displayed. Instead, one of
the following errors occurs, depending on the URL used.

Browsing http://localhost/
--------------------------

Attempting to browse http://localhost causes a message box to appear, containing
the following error message:

   Document contains no data

Browsing http://<ServerName>/
---------------------------

Attempting to browse the site using the host name of the local computer causes
the following error message to be displayed in the browser:

   Under Construction

   The site you were trying to reach does not currently have a default page. It
   may be in the process of being upgraded.

   Please try this site again later. If you still experience the problem, try
   contacting the Web site administrator.

CAUSE
=====

The site is being browsed through a proxy, rather than browsing the local host
directly, which causes the Iisstart.asp file to determine that the browser is
not local.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the settings so that Navigator or Communicator does not use the proxy
when browsing the local computer.

For example, in Netscape Navigator version 4.08, perform the following:

1. On the Edit menu, click Preferences.

2. In the Category tree, click Advanced, and then Proxies.

3. In the area to the right, if Automatic proxy configuration is currently
   selected, click Manual proxy configuration.

4. Next to Manual proxy configuration, click View.

5. Verify that the information needs is provided in the Servers section (at a
   minimum, the name of the HTTP server, using port 80, is typically needed).

6. In the Exceptions text box, type "localhost" (without the quotation marks)
   and the host name of your computer, separated by a comma.

7. Click OK twice to close the dialog box.

NOTE: You will be prompted for your user name and password before being allowed
access to Localstart.asp. Provide the user name in the form of Domain\UserName
if you are in a domain.
