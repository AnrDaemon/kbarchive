TITLE   :XFOR: Directory Entries Not Imported From Novell GroupWise
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use an import filter to specify that certain directory entries from a
Novell GroupWise post office need to be imported during directory
synchronization (dirsync), and then you perform a full reload, the entries are
not imported. This issue occurs if you specify a domain, post office, or
directory entry name that contains extended characters.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the code pages used by the Exchange Server computer
and the Novell GroupWise Application Programming Interface (API) Gateway are
different. Exchange Server can convert code pages during dirsync, but it
performs this conversion process after the import filter has been evaluated. If
the code pages are different and the strings that are specified in the import
filter contain extended characters, this may prevent the Exchange Server
computer from properly evaluating the import filter to determine which directory
entries to import.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 4.


MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the GroupWise API Gateway uses code page 437. The Exchange Server
computer is typically configured to use code page 1252.

For additional information about specifying an import filter, please see the
Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise user's guide (the Gwconn.rtf
file) that is available in the Exchconn\Setup\<platform>\Gwxconn folder on
the Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 3 CD-ROM, where <platform> is
the appropriate folder on the CD-ROM (I386 or Alpha). Note that the latest
service pack for Exchange Server 5.5 is also available on the Internet.
