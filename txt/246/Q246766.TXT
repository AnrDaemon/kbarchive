   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run an executable file or a batch file from the command
prompt on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 or Windows NT
Workstation 4.0, the file may not run. When you then attempt to run the
executable file from the Autoexec.bat file, using the %pathext% variable, the
file still may not run.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when a value is missing from the following registry
key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
 Manager\Environment

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, add the pathext value to the Environment key in the
registry:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and locate the following key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
 Manager\Environment

2. Add the value to the registry key:

   a. On the Edit menu, click Add Value.

   b. In the Value Name box, type the following:

   PATHEXT=.COM;.EXE;.CMD;.BAT

      NOTE: Add any extensions that need to be executable.

   c. In the Data Type list, click REG_SZ, and then click OK.

3. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.
