TITLE   :XFOR: Chat Service Does Not Run with PowerChute Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack (SP) 1 with the Chat
service installed on a Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 SP 3-based computer with
the American Power Conversion PowerChute service installed, the Chat service may
not start. You may receive an error message about Error 16389, and Event Viewer
may record Event IDs 14 and 7023 in the application log.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the PowerChute service prevents the Chat service
from starting properly.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, start the Chat service first. Follow these steps:

1. Quit the PowerChute and Chat service.

2. Set the PowerChute service startup option to Manual.

3. Start the Chat service, and then start the PowerChute service manually.

   NOTE: You must now remember to start the PowerChute service manually after
   each startup.
