TITLE   :XFOR: Dirsync: Export Containers Empty After Applying 5.5 SP3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Directory synchronization (dirsync) appears not to work after you apply
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 3 (SP3) to an Exchange Server
computer that is running as a dirsync requestor to a Microsoft Mail (MS Mail)
postoffice.

The Exchange Server computer appears to receive updates from the MS Mail
postoffices and the dirsync server, but only the mailboxes found in the default
Recipients container are sent to the MS Mail postoffices.

When you open the properties of the dirsync requestor object in the Microsoft
Exchange Server Administrator program, the Export Containers window is empty.

NOTE: In most cases, re-adding the Recipients containers to the Export Containers
window does not change the outcome.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, restore the Dxa.exe file from the Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 2 (SP2) CD:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Services, and stop the Microsoft Exchange
   Directory Synchronization service.

2. Rename the %SystemRoot%\Exchsrvr\Bin\Dxa.exe file to *.old.

3. Copy the Dxa.exe file from the Exchange Server SP2 CD to the
   %SystemRoot%\Exchsrvr\Bin folder.

4. Add the Recipients containers that you want to export to the Export These
   Recipients list on the Export Containers tab of the DXA Requestor object.

5. Run a manual dirsync in accordance with the procedure outlined in the
   following Microsoft Knowledge Base article

   Q148309 XFOR: Manual Dir-Sync with Exchange as Dir-Sync Requestor

   or wait for the next dirsync cycle.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 SP3.
