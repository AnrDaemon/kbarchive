SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install a 3Com 3C575-TX network adapter, the installation
may stop, and you may receive this error message:

   Missing Oemnt.inf or Oemsetup.inf file

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you try to install a 3Com 3C575-TX network adapter on
a computer running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.

CardBus specification. The CardBus specification implements a 32-bit
architecture and allows operation at speeds up to 33 MHz. This specification
requires drivers beyond the scope of the PC Card 2.1 specifications that Windows
NT 4.0 supports.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, install the 3Com 3C574-TX network adapter.
