The information in this article applies to:

 - Interix versions 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot view the exit status of an Interix process from Win32.

CAUSE
=====

The exit status that is available to a Win32 process is generated from Posix.exe
or Psxrun.exe. Posix.exe and Psxrun.exe are programs that communicate with the
subsystem, and do not return the exit code of a subsystem.

STATUS
======

This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
release.
