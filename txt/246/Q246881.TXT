SYMPTOMS

If you send a message to a distribution list (DL) through the Internet Mail
Service on an Exchange Server computer that is configured to send content
formatted in Transport-Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF), you may receive a
non-delivery report (NDR) similar to the following:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

      Subject:  <subject>
      Sent:     10/20/99 8:16 PM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

      <recipient> on 10/20/99 8:28 PM
         The recipient name is not recognized
            The MTS-ID of the original message is: c=US;a= ;p=Microsoft
            ;l=TOTO-991021001549Z-18747
         MSEXCH:IMS:microsoft:<site>:<server> 0 (000C05A6) Unknown Recipient

where <recipient> is the display name of the DL, rather than the individual
recipient that is not recognized.
