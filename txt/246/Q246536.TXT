SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a vCard from a contact, the vCard is populated with information
from the global address list.

CAUSE
=====

The contact's e-mail address resolves against the global address list.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook 2000.

WORKAROUND

To work around this issue, you can create a one-off address for the e-mail
address from your contact. To create a one-off address:

1. Open the contact.

2. Click the Address Book icon in the contact for e-mail.

3. In the Select Name window, click New.

4. In the New Entry window, click "In this entry only" at the bottom of the
   window.

5. Click Internet Address, and click OK.

6. Type in the SMTP address you require in the Display Name and E-mail Address
   fields, and then click OK.

This creates the entry as a one-off address in the contact.
