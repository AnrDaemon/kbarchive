SUMMARY
=======

Porting GNU software packages can be difficult because path name assumptions are
hard coded in the source, and configure scripts are designed to make porting to
traditional systems trivial.

It may be useful to set up a test system installed at the root of a drive, where
the value of $Interix_ROOT is //C, so that the file hierarchy is very similar to
a traditional system. By employing this method, the program can be made to work
quickly. Further investigation can determine the path name assumptions.

Further, the ability of configure scripts to work out the characteristics of
Interix depends entirely on how "clever" the script is, and the assumptions it
makes. Because of this, it is not possible to define a recipe for fixing
configure scripts because each is different.
