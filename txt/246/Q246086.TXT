TITLE   :XADM: Exchange Service Pack Stops with 0xc0020003 or 0xc0020002
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you apply a service pack to an Exchange Server computer, the update does not
work and one of the following error messages is displayed:

   The system cannot find the path specified.
   Microsoft Windows NT
   ID no:0xc0020003

   - or -

   The system cannot find the file specified.
   Microsoft Windows NT
   ID no:0xc0020002

CAUSE
=====

An 0xc0020003 error message is displayed as a result of missing paths that are
required in Exchange Server, and an 0xc0020003 error message is displayed as a
result of missing files that are required in Exchange Server. This is usually
the result of administrative maintenance, such as cleaning up files and folders
that do not seem necessary.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

1. Make sure that you have the CD that Exchange Server was originally installed
   from.

2. Stop the system attendant and disable it.

3. Start the Setup program. When an 0xc002042c error message is displayed, click
   OK.

4. Click Reinstall. (This does not change the current databases, it only
   replaces missing folder trees and files.)

5. The Setup program eventually stops and an 0xc0020422 error message is
   displayed (because of the disabled system attendant). Click OK.

6. Enable the system attendant.

7. Start an update from the service pack CD, for example, Service Pack 1,
   Service Pack 2, or Service Pack 3.

The update finishes successfully.
