PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The sample macro for granting proxy access on individual Novell GroupWise
mailboxes, Proxy.wcm, was written for use with the Novell GroupWise 4.x client
and will not run on a Novell GroupWise 5.x client.

This macro is included on the Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 CD-ROM and
can be found in the following directory from the root of the CD-ROM:

   \SERVER\MIGRATE\TOOLS\GWISE

To manually set the proxy mailbox for migration purposes from each GroupWise 5.x
client, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Proxy.

2. Click the Address Book button next to Name.

3. Select the user to which you want to give the proxy rights, and then click OK
   twice to apply the changes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Groupwise 4.x macro does not work with Groupwise 5.x clients because
Groupwise 5.x clients do not support macros. For information about using a
Novell GroupWise macro to grant proxy access rights, refer to Chapter 10,
"Migrating from Novell GroupWise" in the Microsoft Exchange Server Migration
Guide.

If you encounter issues using a macro to set proxy access, refer to your Novell
GroupWise documentation or contact Novell GroupWise technical support.
