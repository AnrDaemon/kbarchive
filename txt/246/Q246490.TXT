TITLE   :PRB: Unspecified Error When You Add an HTML Template to WebClass
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp600 kbVisID600 kbWebClasses kbGrpDSASP kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When adding an HTML template to a WebClass, Visual Basic may display the
following error message in a WebClass Designer dialog box:

   An unspecified error has occurred

CAUSE
=====

The Triedit.dll, which is located by default in the C:\Program Files\Common
Files\Microsoft Shared\Triedit folder or its dependent dynamic-link libraries
(DLLs), may not be registered correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Unregister and reregister the Triedit.dll by entering the following command in
the Run box, accessed from the Start button, or within the Command Prompt:

   regsvr32 /u "c:\program files\common files\microsoft shared\triedit\triedit.dll"
   regsvr32 "c:\program files\common files\microsoft shared\triedit\triedit.dll"

You should be able to add an HTML template to your WebClass. If this does not
work, the error may not be the Triedit.dll, but its dependent DLLs. You may have
to update Internet Explorer to the latest version. Or, do an uninstall and
reinstall of Internet Explorer.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Triedit.dll is installed with Visual Studio, Office, and Internet Explorer.
When an HTML template is added to a WebClass, the Triedit.dll is used to parse
the HTML template to search for tags that could trigger server events.
