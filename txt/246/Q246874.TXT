TITLE   :INFO: Visual SourceSafe 6.0 Installation From Visual C++ 6.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article delineates the differences between an individual Visual SourceSafe
version 6.0 installation from a Visual SourceSafe installation from Visual C++
6.0 Enterprise Edition.

Visual SourceSafe version 6.0 is included with the Visual C++ 6.0 Enterprise
Edition product. When a you install Visual SourceSafe using the Visual C++ setup
procedure, you are presented with the following two setup options:

 - Install Visual C++ Enterprise Edition

 - Server Applications

MORE INFORMATION
================

Install Visual C++ Enterprise Edition

This option creates a private database on your local machine; it does not create
a Netsetup image. Choosing this option installs the same options as the Stand
Alone setup option in the individual boxed version of the product.

 - Create Database

 - Admin Tools

 - Client Tools

 - Integration components and Registry Settings

 - Help Files

Server Applications

This option creates a shared database and installs the admin software and the
Netsetup program so that users can install the client software from the server.
Choosing this option installs the same components as the Shared Database Server
setup option in the individual boxed version of the product.

 - Create Database

 - Admin Tools

 - Client Tools

 - Integration components and Registry Settings

 - Help Files

 - Netsetup Image

 - IE4 Setup Image

Use the Server Applications option when you are creating a database that will be
used by many clients. This option can be used to install a database to a local
or remote drive. You should use the Install Visual C++ Enterprise Edition option
when you want to set up a local, private database on your computer.

Although the look of the Enterprise Edition setup procedures and the individual
boxed version setup procedures are very different, they all install the same
components. It makes no difference which product you purchase (Visual Studio
version 6.0 Enterprise, Visual C++ 6.0 Enterprise, Visual Basic 6.0 Enterprise,
or SourceSafe in its own box). The same product and the same components are
installed on your computer.
