TITLE   :Cannot Reserve IP Addresses Using Swedish Dhcpadmn.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Swedish language-version of Windows NT 4.0 Server, you cannot add DHCP
address reservations by using the Dhcpadmn.exe tool for any IP address that
contains three decimal digits in any octet. You can enter a maximum of two
decimal digits for each octet in the reservation dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the octet edit fields in the reservation dialog box in
the Dhcpadmn.exe tool are too small.

RESOLUTION
==========
