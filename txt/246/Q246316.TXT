The information in this article applies to:

 - Interix versions 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Currently, the Interix system does not have a single-rooted file system. In
Microsoft Windows NT, multiple volumes are available by using drive letters. To
use Interix to obtain access to these volumes, you must use the syntax "//L"
(where L must be an uppercase letter).

This requirement directly affects your code porting process. Configure scripts,
makefiles, and objects such as file selection boxes in X programs do not make
allowances for the "special" volume prefix.

There are two scenarios where this is an issue:

 - Configure scripts assume the absolute locations of certain utilities ->
   /bin/rm or /bin/sh. On an Interix system, sh is located in $Interix_ROOT/bin
   ($OPENNT_ROOT deprecated). In shell scripts of pathnames passed to functions
   /bin/sh will not work.

 - Even if absolute locations (such as //C/Interix/bin) are defined for the
   current installation, these will not be correct on systems where Interix is
   installed on a different volume.
