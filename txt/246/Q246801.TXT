SYMPTOMS
========

When you have a computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 (Service Pack
4) with St. Bernard Software's Open File Manager utility, version 5.1, you may
receive a STOP 0x0000000A error message when the Ofmntdrv.sys file does not run
during a scheduled backup. If you restart and log on to the computer, you may
receive the same error message while services are still loading.

CAUSE
=====

The cause is unknown.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, stop all third-party services, and then restart
the computer. Restart the third-party services one at a time, restarting the
computer after each, until you identify the problem service.
