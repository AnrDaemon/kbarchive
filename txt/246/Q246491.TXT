SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) 4000 printer through the LPT1 or
LPT2 port on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service
Pack 3 or Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, the print job may not be printed and
you may receive the following error message:

   Access is denied printing to <port>...

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To resolve this behavior, delete the HP print monitor information values from the
registry:

1. Using the Services tool in Control Panel, stop the Spooler service.

2. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and then locate the following registry
   key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors

3. Delete the HP Jet Admin value and the HP Language Monitor value.

4. Restart the computer.

   NOTE: The Spooler service starts automatically when you restart the computer.
