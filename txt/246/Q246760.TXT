KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you connect to the Internet through a cable modem on a computer running both
Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 and Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0, you may
experience interruptions in your service shortly after connecting. You are able
to identify remote sites by IP (Internet Protocol) address (PING), but not by
host name. The DNS (Domain Name Server) has been configured properly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if the signal strength on your cable modem is too low.
The signal's strength may be diminished if the length of the cable from your
cable modem to your cable company's connection point exceeds the recommended
length for the cable transmitting the signal.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact your cable company and request to have signal
repeaters added to the line to amplify the signal.
