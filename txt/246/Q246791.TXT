======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to configure a status message filter rule, the System
Management Server (SMS) Administrator Console appears to stop responding every
time it retrieves the possible values for a drop-down box.

NOTE: When the Administrator Console becomes unresponsive, the hourglass icon is
not present.

CAUSE
=====

When you configure a status message filter rule, the property sheet queries the
status messages stored in the database to retrieve all possible values to
populate the drop-down boxes. In an environment with a large number of status
messages, this query can take several minutes to complete.

In addition, the data is not cached after the first retrieval which causes every
subsequent attempt to use a drop-down box to result in a similar delay.

WORKAROUND
==========

To keep the delay to a minimum, configure the site to keep a minimum number of
status messages in the site database. For more information on configuration of
the status message system, please refer to Chapter 20 of the Microsoft Systems
Management Administrator's Guide.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
