TITLE   :BUG: Certain Icons May Cause Error with FoxPro
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp600bug kbXBase kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Icon files (*.ICO) usually have two or more resources contained within them.
Each resource can be built with a different number of colors. Viewing an icon
file that has a 32x32 resource that was built with greater than 256 colors
causes the Visual FoxPro (VFP) versions mentioned above to exit. This occurs
when Visual FoxPro is running on Microsoft Windows NT.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

From Visual FoxPro, you can get a dialog to view an icon in a number of ways:
assigning an .ico to a project, through the PICTURE property of an image
control, and so forth. The easiest way to reproduce this, however, is with
GETPIC().

1. Using Impact Software's Microangelo (information available on their Web site
   at: http://www.impactsoft.com/muangelo/muangelo.html), or some other icon
   editor, create an icon. Include a 32x32 resource with more than 256 colors.

2. Open one of the Visual FoxPro versions listed above and execute the following
   command from the Command window:

   ? GETPIC()

3. When the dialog box appears, locate the icon created in step 1. Select the
   icon and PREVIEW it (using either the preview checkbox or button).

Using Visual FoxPro 6.0 (no service pack), the following error might occur and
then Visual FoxPro exits:

   Fatal error: Exception code=C0000005

Using Visual FoxPro 5.0x and Visual FoxPro 6.0 SP3, the following error might
occur and FoxPro exits or VFP shuts down without reporting an error:

   APPLICATION ERROR. The instruction at <memory address> referenced
   memory at <memory address>. The memory could not be "read".
