TITLE   :Print Jobs Randomly Stop Responding with HP JetDirect Printing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a large TCP/IP-based network that uses Hewlett-Packard (HP) JetDirect
printing, print jobs may randomly become stuck in the print queue, and the
Spooler service may need to be stopped and restarted several times a day. Using
the HP JetAdmin software to reestablish a connection with the printer also
restarts print jobs.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is most likely to occur when there are many router hops between the
print server and the printer, and there is a large number of printers per print
server. In large TCP/IP-based networks with many hops between print servers and
the printers, JetAdmin has difficulty maintaining a connection with the
JetDirect adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, either move the print server to the same network segment as the
printers, or use LPR printing instead of JetDirect printing when there is a
large number of router hops between the print server and the printers.
