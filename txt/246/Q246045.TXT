MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on this vulnerability, see the following Microsoft Web
site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms99-055.asp

If you suspect that an RFPoison attack has occurred and your Dr. Watson
information is consistent with the attack, an analysis of the User.dmp log file
may confirm the attack. The User.dmp file is created in the %SystemRoot% folder
when Services.exe stops working if the Create Crash Dump File check box is
selected in Drwtsn32.exe.
