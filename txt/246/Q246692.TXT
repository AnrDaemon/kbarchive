TITLE   :XADM: Searching Contacts in Public Folders May Be Slow
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5

KEYWORDS:kbenv exc55

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

When you perform a search for contacts in a public folder in Microsoft Outlook
(on the Tools menu, click Find), you may experience poor response times.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you perform a search for contacts in public folders, the server performs a
sequential search and you receive correspondingly poor response times with a
large number of records. The Find command is not a database query and does not
use view indexes for searching.

For faster results, type the first few characters of the name you are looking for
while the Contacts folder is selected. This action highlights the first matching
contact.

Additional query words: advanced
