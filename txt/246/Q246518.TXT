TITLE   :Cannot Remotely Add or Delete Printer Ports in Windows NT Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to add or delete printer ports on a remote Microsoft Windows NT
Server 4.0-based print server, you cannot do so.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

To add, delete, or configure printer ports, you must administer the print server
locally.

To work around this issue, use local administration of the print server to add,
delete, or configure printer ports.

NOTE: To perform remote administration of a print server, you can either use a
third-party utility or create a utility by using the AddPort application
programming interface (API) function included in the Microsoft Win32 Software
Development Kit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Local administration of a print server is explained on page 193 of Concepts and
Planning, which is part of the documentation for Microsoft Windows NT Server
4.0.

Additional query words: nt 4.0 add remote print server remove configure
