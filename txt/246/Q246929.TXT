SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the URI Cache Flushes performance counter in the Windows 2000
Performance Monitor, the counter appears to initialize at a value greater than
zero.

RESOLUTION
==========

The "URI Cache Flushes" performance counter is defined as the "URI Cache Flushes
since server startup," and is reset to zero when Internet Information Services
(IIS) restarts, but it increases immediately when you restart, as IIS often
flushes the URI cache.

The following is a quote from the IIS 5.0 Resource Guide, which is available from
Microsoft Press:

   Cache flushes are regulated, in part, by an internal timer. The timer
   activates the object-cache scavenger, which deletes expired objects. Objects
   are flushed from the cache if they change, or if they time out before they
   are reused.

   To measure cache flushes, compare the number of cache flushes over time to the
   number of cache misses and to the rate of page faults in the Inetinfo process
   (as indicated by the Process\ Page Faults/sec: Inetinfo counter). It is
   important to observe these values over time. Like the other global IIS 5.0
   counters, Cache Flushes displays an instantaneous value, not an average.
