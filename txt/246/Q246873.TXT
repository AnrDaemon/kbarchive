======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article delineates the differences between an individual Visual SourceSafe
version 6.0 installation from a Visual SourceSafe installation from Visual
Studio 6.0 Enterprise edition.

Visual SourceSafe version 6.0 is included with the Visual Studio 6.0 Enterprise
Edition product. When you install Visual SourceSafe using the Visual Studio
setup procedure, you are presented with the following three setup options:

 - Custom

 - Product

 - Server Applications

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the Custom or Products installation options to install the client
components of Visual SourceSafe. Use the Server Applications option to install
the Server and Administrative components of Visual SourceSafe.

Custom

This option creates a private database on the customer's local computer; it does
not create a Netsetup image. Choosing this option installs the same components
as the Stand Alone setup option in the individual boxed version of the product.

 - Create Database

 - Admin Tools

 - Client Tools

 - Integration components and Registry Settings

 - Help Files

Products

This option creates a private database on the customer's local computer; it does
not create a Netsetup image. Choosing this option installs the same components
as the Stand Alone setup option in the individual boxed version of the product.

 - Create Database

 - Admin Tools

 - Client Tools

 - Integration components and Registry Settings

 - Help Files

Choosing Product instead of Custom has no effect on which Visual SourceSafe
components are installed. You see slightly different Setup Wizard screens, but
both options install the client-side components to the your computer.

Server Applications

This option creates a Shared database and installs the Admin Software and the
Netsetup program so users can install the client software from the server.
Choosing this option installs the same components as the Shared Database Server
setup option in the individual boxed version of the product.

 - Create Database

 - Admin Tools

 - Client Tools

 - Integration components and Registry Settings

 - Help Files

 - Netsetup Image

 - IE4 Setup Image

Use the Server Applications option when you are creating a database that will be
used by many clients. This option can be used to install a database to a local
or remote drive. You should use the Product or Custom option when you want to
set up a local, private database on your computer.

Although the look of the Enterprise Edition setup procedures and the individual
boxed version setup procedures are very different, they all install the same
components. It makes no difference which product you purchase (Visual Studio
version 6.0 Enterprise, Visual C++ 6.0 Enterprise, Visual Basic 6.0 Enterprise,
or Visual SourceSafe in its own box). The same product and the same components
get installed to the your computer.
