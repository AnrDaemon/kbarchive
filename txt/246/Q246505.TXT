-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server, version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to grant a domain account permissions to a cluster by using the
Cluster Administrator may return a dialog box with the following message:

   The SYSTEM account must always have access to the Cluster. Please use the
   permissions dialog box to add the SYSTEM account.

CAUSE
=====

The SYSTEM account is a special account used by the operating system. If this
account does not exist, no other users can be granted access.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the SYSTEM account to the Permissions window. This action allows you to
grant other users access to the cluster.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior:

1. On one of the cluster nodes, open Cluster Administrator and open a connection
   to the local cluster.

2. Right-click the cluster at the root of the tree-view in the left pane to
   display the properties dialog box.

3. Click Permissions on the General tab.

4. Remove the SYSTEM account from the list.

5. Add a domain account that is not a member of the local Administrators group.

6. Click OK.
