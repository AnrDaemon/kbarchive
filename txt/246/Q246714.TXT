TITLE   :Errors When AS/400 Network Attribute DDMACC Is Set to *REJECT
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP2,4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp2 kbsna400sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the AS/400 Network Attribute DDMACC is set to a value of *REJECT, the
following data providers cannot connect over TCP/IP:

    - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2

If the AS/400 Network Attribute DDMACC is set to a value of *REJECT, testing the
connection for the data providers listed above returns the following error
messages.

For Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM:

   Test connection failed because of an error in initializing provider. User is
   not authorized to use this command.

For Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2:

   Test connection failed because of an error in initializing provider. User is
   not authorized to use this command. SQLSTATE: HY000, SQLCODE: -269

For Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2:

   Connection failed [Microsoft][ODBC Driver for DB2][Microsoft DB2 OLE DB
   Provider]User is not authorized to use this command. SQLSTATE: HY000,
   SQLCODE: -269

CAUSE
=====

The AS/400 Network Attribute DDMACC specifies how the AS/400 handles incoming
Distributed Data Management (DDM) and Distributed Relational Database
Architecture (DRDA) requests from remote systems. If DDMACC is set to a value of
*REJECT, incoming requests from remote systems for DDM or DRDA access are
denied. If DDMACC is set to a value of *OBJAUT, incoming requests for DDM or
DRDA access are granted with proper authorization.

RESOLUTION
==========

DDMACC must be set to a value of *OBJAUT for the Microsoft data providers listed
above to be able to connect.
