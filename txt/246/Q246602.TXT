TITLE   :XADM: Pfadmin Won't Work with Err. Mssg.: OpenAddressBook Failed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the Pfadmin.exe utility with the setacl switch by using the following
command

   pfadmin "<your_profile>" setacl
   "<public_folder>\<subfolder>" "<user_mailbox>"
   <rights>

the command may not work and the following error message may be displayed:

   CMapiSession::GetAddressBook: m_pMapiSession-->OpenAddressBook failed,
   error = 0x40380.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you use a profile that was created with Outlook 2000
in the syntax of the Pfadmin.exe command. Typically, this problem only occurs if
you use a profile from an Outlook 2000 client that was upgraded from Microsoft
Outlook 98 and had existing Outlook 98 profiles.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either use an Outlook 98 workstation, or use an
Outlook 98 profile on an Outlook 2000 workstation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Create two test mailboxes. Name them "Test MB1" and "Test MB2."

2. Verify that Outlook 2000 is installed on the test workstation.

3. Log on as the service account, or an account that has similar permissions.

4. Create a new Outlook profile. Name it "OL2000 Profile" and point it to the
   Test MB1 mailbox.

5. Start Outlook by using the newly created profile.

6. Click to expand Public Folders, click to expand All Public Folders, and then
   create a new folder named PFAdmin Test.

7. Quit and log off from Outlook.

8. At a command prompt, change to the folder where the Pfadmin.exe utility is
   located, and then type the following:

   pfadmin "OL2000 Profile" setacl "PFAdmin Test" "Test MB2" PA

9. This command attempts to grant the Test MB2 mailbox the role of Publishing
   Author (PA). However, the command does not work and the following error
   message is displayed:

   CMapiSession::GetAddressBook: m_pMapiSession-->OpenAddressBook failed,
   error = 0x40380.
