TITLE   :Excessive LSASS CPU Usage with Multiple SMS Sites in Same Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If multiple Systems Management Server (SMS) site servers share the same
Microsoft Windows NT-based domain, high amounts of network usage may occur at
the beginning of each hour, on the hour. The CPU usage on the primary domain
controller may also peak on the hour (with high usage by the LSASS process).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Collection Evaluator on a primary site erroneously
calls GetUserGroups a number of times during collection processing. Creating,
deleting, or modifying a collection causes GetUserGroups to be called numerous
times in quick succession (possibly up to 15 times).

If many SMS primary sites share the same domain and there is a lot of collection
activity, the primary domain controller may experience peaks in processor
activity while it is handling multiple GetUserGroups calls.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can reduce the number of GetUserGroups calls that are sent to the domain
controllers by extending the collection refresh times or by disabling collection
refreshes altogether.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
