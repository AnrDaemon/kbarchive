SUMMARY
=======

This article describes system administration of user accounts with Interix.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The user database on a Microsoft Windows NT-based computer is quite different
from what an administrator might be used to. For example, there is no file such
as /Etc/Passwd or /Etc/Groups to edit. Instead, all entries (users and groups)
are handled in the user database. In the $Interix_ROOT/Usr/Examples/Admin
directory, there are several scripts to help add, delete, and modify user
accounts: useradd, userdel, and usermod.

To use these scripts, you must be logged on to the primary domain server. For
instance, if computer A is the domain server for computer D and B (its client),
you must log on to computer A, either by using telnet from computer B or by
physically going to computer A. The scripts will not work if you are logged on
to computer B, even if you are logged on to B as DEV+Administrator.

For additional information about adding, deleting, and modifying users, see the
following Interix Web site:
