TITLE   :XADM: Directory Service Not Responding on Two Exchange Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to administer a remote server running Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5
from a local server also running Exchange Server 5.5, the Directory service may
not respond on either server. Event Viewer may record the following event on
both servers, with each server referencing the other:

   Event ID: 1186
   Source: MSExchangeDS
   Type: Error
   Category: Replication
   Description: The internal directory replication agent (DRA) Dispatcher thread
   is waiting in a remote procedure call to directory SERVER1. The directory has
   attempted to cancel the call and recover the thread, with status 0x0. If this
   condition persists, stop and restart that Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Directory service experiences a remote
procedure call (RPC) lock with the remote Exchange server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, follow these instructions in this exact order:

1. Stop the Exchange Server services on the local server.

2. Stop the Exchange Server services on the remote server.

3. Restart the local server, allowing the Exchange Server services to start up
   automatically.

4. Restart the remote server, allowing the Exchange Server services to start up
   automatically.

Additional query words: RPC remote procedure call ping
