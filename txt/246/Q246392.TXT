SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to uninstall Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 on
a computer running Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you uninstall Metadirectory Services, make sure that you are not going to
jeopardize any data in the Metadirectory. To successfully remove Metadirectory
Services from a computer running Windows NT 4.0 Server, follow these steps:

1. Stop the Zoomit Service.

2. Click Start, click Run, type "cmd" (without the quotation marks) in the Open
   box, and then click OK.

3. At the command prompt, navigate to the Zoomserv\Bin folder on your computer.

4. Type "setupsvc -remove" (without the quotation marks).

5. After this command completes successfully, delete the Zoomserv folder or use
   the Add/Remove Programs tool to uninstall Metadirectory Services and all of
   its components.

Before you try to uninstall the Metadirectory Services, make sure that the server
has stopped and that no Management Agents (MAs) are running. The primary MA
executable is the Importt.exe program. This program gains direct access to the
database and does not need Via running in order to have the database open. Use
Task Manager to verify that there are no VIAServer or IMPORTT processes running.
