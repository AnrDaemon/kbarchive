TITLE   :User Manager for Domains and Server Manager Cannot Find PDC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open the User Manager for Domains utility from a primary
domain controller (PDC) running Microsoft Windows NT Server 3.51 or 4.0, User
Manager for Domains may not open and you may receive the following error
message:

   Could not find domain controller for this domain. Do you want to select
   another domain to administer?

Also, when you attempt to open the Server Manager utility, you are not able to
find the PDC.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the PDC is also configured as a Windows Internet
Naming Service (WINS) server and the primary and secondary WINS server fields in
the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) configuration are
blank. The User Manager for Domains and Server Manager utilities rely on these
domain<1bh> and domain<1ch> network basic input/output system
(NetBIOS) mappings to locate the PDC, even when you are running these utilities
from the PDC itself.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, in the TCP/IP configuration of the PDC/WINS server,
configure the server to point to itself as the primary and secondary WINS
server. Follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network, and then click the Protocols tab.

2. In the Network Protocols box, click TCP/IP Protocol, and then click
   Properties.

3. Click the WINS Address tab, and then type the IP address of the PDC/WINS
   server in both the Primary WINS Server and Secondary WINS Server boxes.

4. Click OK, and then click Close.

5. Click Yes to restart the computer.
