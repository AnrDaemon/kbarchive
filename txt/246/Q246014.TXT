TITLE   :XCLN: Outlook Y2K Information & Compliancy with Exchange Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbYear2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To determine whether the version of Microsoft Outlook you are running is year
2000 (Y2K) compliant, check the client version.

IMPORTANT: You cannot use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program to make
this check even though the Administrator program includes a Client Version
column in the private information store Logons container. The client version
information in this column is collected from the Emsmdb32.dll file, which
resides on the client workstation, and not from the actual client. That is, the
client version number displayed in the Client Version column is that of the
Emsmdb32.dll file, not Outlook, and therefore, doesn't determine Y2K compliancy
for Outlook applications.

To determine the correct version of Microsoft Outlook applications, in Outlook,
click About Microsoft Outlook on the Help menu.

MORE INFORMATION

To provide in-depth Y2K information for both the IT professional and the home

Computers."
