The information in this article applies to:

 - Interix versions 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article is a summarization of the inetd "super server" with Interix and the
related daemons you can start with inetd.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The package contains:

 - inetd

 - The "super server" and Inetd.conf (its configuration file)

 - The following "daemons," utilities, and files (installed under
   $Interix_ROOT):

   bin/rcp
   bin/rdist
   bin/rdistd
   bin/regpwd
   bin/rlogin
   bin/rsh
   bin/talk
   bin/tftp
   etc/inetd.conf
   usr/sbin/in.fingerd
   usr/sbin/in.rlogind
   usr/sbin/in.ftpd
   usr/sbin/in.ntalkd
   usr/sbin/in.rshd
   usr/sbin/in.telnetd
   usr/sbin/in.tftpd
   usr/sbin/in.rexecd
   usr/sbin/inetd

Note that most of the daemons are in the usr/sbin sub-folder. Users with a Linux
or BSD background may note that the daemon names conform to the System V
convention. Man pages are available under the "root" name, for example, man
telnetd instead of man in.telnetd.

There are two identical copies of the telnetd binary, bin/telnetd and
sbin/in.telnetd. The sbin/in.telnetd copy is specified in the Inetd.conf file.
The copy in bin is maintained for backward compatibility and will eventually
disappear. The regpwd utility is used to create .password files.

NOTE: For security reasons, this Interix port of the FTP server (In.ftpd), does
not support anonymous FTP. For more information about this package, see the
following topics in tech note 0008:
