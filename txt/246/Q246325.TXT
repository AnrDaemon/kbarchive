SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the system administration of file and directory access in
Interix.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, Microsoft Windows NT users do not require Execute permissions on all
components of a directory path to gain access to a file. To change this
configuration for Interix users, disable the Bypass Traverse Checking privilege
using the following steps:

1. Log on as Administrator.

2. Start User Manager.

3. On the Policies menu, click User Rights.

4. Click Show Advanced User Rights.

5. In the Bypass Traverse Checking area, replace Everyone with the list of users
   who do not require Posix.1 conformance. In most Interix installations, no
   users are given the Bypass Traverse Checking privilege.
