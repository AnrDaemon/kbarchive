TITLE   :XFOR: Notes Conversion Fails Processing User-defined Fields
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Notes Conversion Assistant fails when processing records that contain a very
large number of user-defined fields (more than 350 or so). Also, the replication
process may stop and prevent other messages from being saved.

CAUSE
=====

The Notes Conversion Assistant does not process records with a large number of
user-defined fields gracefully. When the Notes Conversion Assistant encounters
such a record, it stops working, generates an error, and does not continue to
process any further records.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

STATUS

version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
