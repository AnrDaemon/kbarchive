TITLE   :XADM: Directory Logging 1349 GUID Changed Events When RPC Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Servers incorrectly log the following event in the event log:

   Event ID: 1349 Source: MSExchangeDS
   Category: Replication
   Type: warning
   Description:
   The GUID on server (Server Name) has changed from
   a86a49730326d3118fb80000f806a267 (Server Name) to
   0a964fd8e0d7d2118faf0000f806a267 (Server Name). This causes all replicas to
   be resynced from scratch.

CAUSE
=====

When there are a lot of changes to be replicated, it may take multiple calls to
transfer the data between the servers. If during the multiple calls there is a
remote procedure call (RPC) error, the global universal identification (GUID) on
the REPS-FROM for the calling server is reset to the invocation ID of the local
server. The next replication cycle detects the GUID change and logs the 1349
error. This logic error causes unnecessary naming context resynchronizations.
Naming context resynchronizations in a large Exchange Server environment can
cause performance degradation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Not all 1349 errors in the event log are a issue. If the server is re-installed,
it gets a new GUID and this should be expected behavior. There is a way to make
sure that a server has the exact symptom described in the "Symptoms" section. In
the 1349 event ID, the GUIDs are logged. With this information, you can check to
see if the first GUID is the same as the invocation-id attribute on the
directory object. If the first GUID is the same as the invocation-id of the
server reporting the 1349 error, contact Microsoft Support for the fix that
resolves this issue.
