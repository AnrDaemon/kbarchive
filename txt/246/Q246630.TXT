The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The name of the type library that has all the COM+ ObjectContext, Object
Control, and related functions and objects is "COM+ Services Type Library" in
Windows 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To be able to use ObjectContext to control transaction outcome and gather
information about the execution context or to receive a callback on activation
and deactivation or to use the Shared Property Manager in an early-bound
fashion, you must set a reference to the COM+ Services Type Library. This is
different than for Windows NT 4.0, where those libraries are called "Microsoft
Transaction Server Type Library" and "Shared Property Manager Type Library."
