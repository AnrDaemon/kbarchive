SUMMARY
=======

This article provides information about working with the xterm client in
Interix.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The xterm client is one of the X11 clients provided as part of the Interix
Workstation Lite, Workstation, and Server packages.

The xterm client is not currently available for Interix on Microsoft Windows NT
3.51. There is a known issue in Windows NT 3.51 which prevents xterm from
running, but it is fixed in Windows NT 4.0.

The xterm client starts the Korn shell, and this is not configurable. If you
prefer to run in the C shell, you can include a .profile in your home folder
which contains the following line:

   exec csh -l

NOTE: Remember to invoke the xterm client as a login shell so that the .profile
is actually read:

   oterm -ls
