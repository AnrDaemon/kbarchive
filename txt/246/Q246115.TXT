SYMPTOMS

When you attempt to start either the Internet Mail Service (Exchange Server 5.0

In the Internet Mail tab, the administrator's mailbox may not be a valid
mailbox.

RESOLUTION

To resolve the problem:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the Configuration
   container, and then click the Connectors container.

2. Double-click either Internet Mail Service or IMC, as applicable.

3. Click the Internet Mail tab of the Internet Mail Service or IMC properties
   page, and then select a valid user for the administrator's mailbox. The
   Exchange Server Internet Mail Service or IMC starts.
