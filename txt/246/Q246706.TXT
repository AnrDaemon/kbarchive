TITLE   :Errors Generated if TCP/IP DDM Server on AS/400 Not Started
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP2,4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp2 kbsna400sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the TCP/IP DDM Server on the AS/400 is not started, the following data
providers cannot connect over TCP/IP:

    - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2

If the TCP/IP DDM Server on the AS/400 is not started, testing the connection for
the data providers listed above will return the following error messages.

For Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM:

   Test connection failed because of an error in initializing provider. The
   partner LU does not recognize the TP name.

For Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2:

   Test connection failed because of an error in initializing provider. Could
   not connect to specified host SQLSTATE: 08S01, SQLCODE: -603

For Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2:

   Connection failed [Microsoft][ODBC Driver for DB2][Microsoft DB2 OLE DB
   Provider]Could not connect to specified host SQLSTATE: 08S01, SQLCODE: -603

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify status of TCP/IP DDM Server on the AS/400 by performing the following
steps:

1. From an AS/400 command line, type following command:

     NETSTAT

2. When the following menu appears, choose option number 3:

     1. Work with TCP/IP interface status 
     2. Display TCP/IP route information 	 
     3. Work with TCP/IP connection status

3. A list similar to the following will be presented:

     Remote     Remote    Local
   Opt  Address    Port      Port       Idle Time    State 
   __   *          *         drda       001:13:15    Listen
   __   *          *         ddm        001:13:15    Listen
   __   *          *         ddm-ssl    001:13:15    Listen

   The list should contain an entry with the Local Port listed as drda. Scroll
   through the list until this entry is located. If this entry is not present,
   the TCP/IP DDM Server has not been started.

4. To start the TCP/IP DDM Server, type the following command from an AS/400
   command line:

     STRTCPSVR SERVER(*DDM)

   If successful, a message will be posted on the screen indicating that the DDM
   Server is starting. Repeat steps 1 through 3 above to verify that the server
   has started properly.

It is also possible to automatically start the DDM server whenever TCP/IP is
started on the AS/400 system. Issue the following command on an AS/400 command
line to enable this functionality:

     CHGDDMTCPA AUTOSTART(*YES)
