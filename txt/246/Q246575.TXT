TITLE   :ADSI Scripts Do Not Work Between Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use ADSI scripts on a computer running Windows 2000 to
manage IIS on a computer running Windows NT 4.0, or if try to manage IIS on a
Windows 2000 computer from a Windows NT 4.0 computer, the following error
messages may occur:

 - From a Windows 2000 computer to a Windows NT 4.0 computer:

   0x800CC810 (MD_ERROR_IISAO_INVALID_SCHEMA)

 - From a Windows NT 4.0 computer to a Windows 2000 computer:

   0x80070003 (ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND)

CAUSE
=====

Full ADSI management of IIS between different versions of Windows is not fully
implemented. The errors are primarily caused by metabase-schema differences
between Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

A fix has been generated to allow backward compatibility, thus allowing a
computer running IIS 5.0 to remotely administer the metabase on a computer
running IIS 4.0 via the IIS Administration Objects (IISAO), the ADSI provider
for IIS. For additional information about this fix, click the article number
