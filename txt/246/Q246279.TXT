TITLE   :XFOR: PAB Addresses Invalid After Migration from MS Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to migrate Microsoft Mail for PC Networks mailboxes to
Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 mailboxes, the addresses in any Personal Address
Book (PAB), including all distribution lists, are invalid. Using them results in
non-delivery reports.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Mail for PC Networks uses an older addressing format, 10/10/10
(Network/Postoffice/Mailbox), which is not valid for current Exchange Server
addressing.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no workaround for this issue. You must recreate each PAB and
distribution list.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is no tool that updates your PAB entries as changes are made in the
Microsoft Exchange Server global address list. Mail bearing a Microsoft Mail for
PC Networks address goes to the Microsoft Mail Connector, which does not have a
postoffice configured with that address and therefore returns the mail as
undeliverable.

When you readdress this undeliverable mail by using the Microsoft Exchange Server
global address list, it is delivered normally. To prevent mail's being
undeliverable because of outdated addressing, replace all PAB entries created in
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks with new ones created in the Exchange Server
environment.
