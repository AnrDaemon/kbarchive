======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) status messages that should be located in the
Statmgr.box folder may be moved to the Statmgr.box\Futureq folder for processing
at a later time. However, these files may never be processed, and this can
generate unreliable or incomplete status messages for the site.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by improper handling of status messages with a
time-stamp that is greater than the current time on the site server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, stop and then restart the SMS_Executive service so
that the files in the Statmgr.box\Futureq folder can be processed correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
