TITLE   :XCLN: No Offline Folder Settings Button in Service Properties
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::; WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to set up an offline folder file, the Enable Offline Use and
Offline Folder Settings buttons may be missing from the Advanced tab in the
Properties of the Exchange Server service in the profile.

When you right-click any of the default folders and then click Properties, there
is no Synchronization tab.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you are run Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition
or Windows 2000 Server (or Advanced Server or Datacenter), and Terminal Services
are enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

For Windows 2000, remove Terminal Services and Terminal Services licensing, and
then restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Offline folders are not allowed on Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition or on
a Windows 2000 server that is running Terminal Services. When you install
Outlook on such a computer, you do not receive the question, "Do you travel with
this computer?". This behavior is by design.
