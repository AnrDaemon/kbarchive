SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft does not recommend or support the changing of system dates for test
purposes (such as year 2000 testing) in a production environment.

Potential data integrity problems can result from performing this action.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Changing the system date to a date other than the current date in a production
environment, followed by rolling back to the correct date, can have a serious
impact on the integrity of program data as well as operating system functions.

This action can affect service functions that are date sensitive, such as DHCP
leases and WINS registrations, and can also invalidate program data that is
processed during the period that the date is incorrect.

Some of the known issues related to changing the system date are discussed in the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base articles. Potential problems may not be
limited to those problems discussed in the following articles. The effects of
setting the system date to an invalid date are not entirely predictable.
