The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The 3270 applet that ships with SNA Server only supports TN3270E protocol. By
default, the SNA Server TN3270 Service supports both TN3270 and TN3270E client
connections. However, if you select the TN3270 Mode only check box for the SNA
Server TN3270 service, the applet does not work. Selecting TN3270 Mode only
limits the TN3270E service to TN3270 mode and the applet cannot connect. The
client session has a blank screen and no errors are generated. A "connecting"
message appears on the status line. TN3270E emulators provided by other vendors
encounter the same problem.

CAUSE
=====

The TN3270 Mode only option was added to SNA Server because some TN3270
emulators are unable to negotiate properly with the TN3270 service. For more
information, please refer to the SNA Server online Help.

The TN3270E protocol is specified by RFC 1647.
