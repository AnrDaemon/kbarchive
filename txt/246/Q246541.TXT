When the LPD service is stressed, Tcpsvcs.exe may leak memory. If you monitor
Working Set and Private Bytes for the Tcpsvcs.exe process in Performance
Monitor, both of these items may show a gradually increase (which may cause the
LPD service to not respond).

NOTE: You must restart the LPD service to clear the condition.
