SUMMARY
=======

Outlook Web Access (OWA) is installed on the default Web site during setup.
Sometimes, you may want to run OWA from another Web site on the same server.
This article offers information about running OWA from another site on the same
server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Follow these steps to configure OWA for use with a different Web site under
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0.

1. Start the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Internet Service snap-in.

2. Expand the Default Web Site.

3. Right-click the Default Web site, and then click Properties.

4. Click the ISAPI Filters tab.

5. In the Filter Name field, highlight "Exchfilt", and then click Remove.

6. Expand the server node on which you want OWA to reside.

7. Right-click the new Web site, and then click Properties.

8. Click the ISAPI Filters tab, and then click Add.

9. In the Filter Name field, type "Exchfilt" (without the quotation marks).

10. In the Executable field, type "c:\Winnt\System32\Exchfilt.dll" (without the
   quotation marks) (assuming that Windows NT is installed on drive C), and
   then click Finish.

NOTE: The status of the Exchfilt filter always shows a red arrow pointing down to
indicate it is not loaded. This is not true, and the filter will work anyway.

11. Right-click the new Web site, click New, and then click Virtual Directory.

12. Type "Exchange" (without the quotation marks) as the alias, and then click
   Next.

13. Type "c:\Exchsrvr\Webdata" (without the quotation marks) as the path, and
   then click Next (assuming that Exchange Server is installed on drive C).

14. Click to select the Allow Read, Allow Script, Allow Execute, and Allow
   Directory Browsing check boxes for access permissions, and then click
   Finish.

15. Right-click the newly created virtual directory, and then click Properties.

16. Click the Directory Security tab.

17. If OWA is installed on the same server as Exchange Server, confirm that the
   Allow Anonymous and the Windows NT Challenge/Response check boxes are both
   selected.

   If OWA is on its own server or your users access OWA from the Internet, then
   make sure that the Allow Anonymous and the Basic Authentication check boxes
   are both selected.

18. In Control Panel, double-click Services, and stop the WWW service.

19. Start the WWW service (this allows the Exchfilt.dll file to load).

20. Make sure the new Web Site is started.

Now you should be able to access OWA by using the following URL:

   http://<new_server_name>/exchange

You can also configure host headers to access OWA from the Internet on this new
Web site.
