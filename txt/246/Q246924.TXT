SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to publish from a UNIX server to a server running on a
Windows-based operating system, the following error message appears:

   The destination Web ignores case. The following pairs of names will
   conflict:
   <filename.txt> and <FileName.txt>
   No files were copied. Name all files in your Web uniquely and try again.

CAUSE
=====

UNIX is a case sensitive operating system. For example, mypage.htm and
MyPage.htm are completely different files and may exist in the same folder.

Windows-based operating systems are not case sensitive. For example, mypage.htm
and MyPage.htm are the same file name and cannot both be published to the same
destination.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Open the Web on the UNIX server and rename the files listed in the message.

2. If you are prompted to update hyperlinks, click Yes.

3. Republish the Web to your Windows server.
