TITLE   :XCON: Event ID 290 and NDR Returned When Sending to Large DL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a user attempts to send a message to a Distribution List (DL), the originator
of the message may receive the following non-delivery report (NDR):

   From: System Administrator
   Sent: Tuesday, November 16, 1999 4:26 PM
   To: <Originator of message>
   Subject: Undeliverable: Check this out!

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   Subject: Check this out!
   Sent: 11/16/99 4:26 PM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

   EVERYONE_ALL_DL on 11/16/99 4:26 PM
   The content length of the message is too long for the recipient to take
   delivery
   MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:corporate:EXCHSERV

The application log also shows an Event ID 290. There are no message size
restrictions on the MTA or user mailbox.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a message size limit placed on the DL. It is a common practice
to put a message size limit on large DLs to prevent users from sending large
attachments to many people, thus overburdening the network and delaying mail
flow.
