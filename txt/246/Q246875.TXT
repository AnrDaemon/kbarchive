KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual SourceSafe version 6.0 is included with the Visual Basic 6.0 Enterprise
Edition product. When you install Visual SourceSafe using the Visual Basic setup
procedure, you are presented with the following two setup options:

 - Install Visual Basic Enterprise Edition

 - Server Applications

MORE INFORMATION
================

Install Visual Basic Enterprise Edition

This creates a private database on your local machine, however it does not create
a Netsetup image. Choosing this option installs the same options as the
stand-alone setup option in the individual boxed version of the product.

 - Create Database

 - Admin Tools

 - Client Tools

 - Integration components and Registry Settings

 - Help Files

Server Applications

This creates a shared database and installs the admin software and the Netsetup
program so that you can install the client software from the server. Choosing
this option installs the same components as the Shared Database Server setup
option in the individual boxed version of the product.

 - Create Database

 - Admin Tools

 - Client Tools

 - Integration components and Registry Settings

 - Help Files

 - Netsetup Image

 - IE4 Setup Image

You should use the Server Applications option when you are creating a database
that is used by many clients. This option can be used to install a database to a
local or remote drive. You should use the Install Visual Basic Enterprise
Edition option when you want to set up a local, private database on your
machine.

Although the look of the Enterprise Edition setup procedures and the individual
boxed version setup procedures are very different, they all install the same
components. It makes no difference which product you purchase; Visual Studio
version 6.0 Enterprise, Visual C++ 6.0 Enterprise, Visual Basic 6.0 Enterprise,
or Visual SourceSafe in its own box. The same product and the same components
are installed to your computer.
