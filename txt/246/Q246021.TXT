The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how you can close a running instance of Microsoft Word
using the SendMessage Application Program Interface (API).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code terminates an instance of Word 97 or Word 2000, even if the
current document has been changed. Note that you will not be prompted to save
changes. Terminating a running Windows application in this manner is considered
bad programming style, however, this method can be effective if you need to
quickly close Word.

This code can be used with either an instance of Word that is already running or
if Word is instantiated using OLE Automation, this example uses OLE Automation
to start Word.

Create a program and enter the following code:

   DECLARE LONG FindWindowA IN WIN32API STRING class, STRING title
   DECLARE INTEGER SendMessage IN Win32API INTEGER HWND,INTEGER Msg, Short WParam, INTEGER LPARAM)

   oWord = Createobject('Word.Application')
   * Pass the class name for Word - "OpusApp" to FindWindowA
   oWordHandle = FindWindowA('OpusApp',NULL)   
   WITH oWord
   	.Documents.Add
   	.Visible=.T.
   	.Selection.InsertAfter ("This is a test.")
   	.Application.Activate   && Activate Word.
   ENDWITH
   =INKEY(3)                   && Wait a couple seconds then close Word.
   =SendMessage(oWordHandle,16,0,0)
