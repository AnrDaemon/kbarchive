SYMPTOMS
========

RFC 959 allows for the use of the PORT command, a remote connection to another
TCP\IP over a passive connections, to be established based on the port address
given by client. This is commonly done with FTP server-to-server transfers. This
behavior was made optional to provide added security to the FTP service.

The FTP service compares the IP address that makes the connection and the address
issuing the PASV command. If they are different, the FTP service does not allow
the connection. When you attempt to do this on the Microsoft FTP Server, this
operation fails, regardless of the settings. For additional information, click
