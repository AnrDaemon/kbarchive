KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to configure the alternate startup option for Microsoft Windows 9x
(Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98) and Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
(Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 or Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0) after
you install Windows NT 4.0 as an alternate operating system on a Windows
9x-based Hewlett-Packard (HP) Pavilion 6350 computer, you may not be able to do
so.

Also, when you are starting the computer to Windows 9x, you may receive a black
screen with no disk activity. This occurs when the computer is reading the
Bootsect.dos file. However, you can successfully start the computer to Windows
NT 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because HP does not support the installation of Windows
NT 4.0 on the HP Pavilion 6350 computer. The HP Pavilion 6350 computer is not on
the Windows NT 4.0 Hardware Compatibility List.
