TITLE   :XADM: Public Folders & Deleted Item Recovery in Exchange Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The item recovery process in Exchange Server 5.5 has made it much easier to
recover the contents of public folders. The recovery process does not recover
all properties of the original public folder. The "More Information" section
discusses some of the major implications of recovering a public folder through
item recovery.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can recover most properties of a public folder such as content, permissions,
forms associated with the folder, and folder rules. However, the following items
will be recovered but altered:

 - The Display Name and Obj-Dist-Name attribute of that folder will be appended
   by the word "recovered", for example:

   /o=XADM/ou=SITE1/cn=Recipients/cn=NPF
   2947606749476067494760674584AC1000007DD

   /o=XADM/ou=SITE1/cn=Recipients/cn=NPF2(RECOVERED)
   947606749476067494760674584AC1000007DE

   The directory object is recreated and causes a replication of both the folder
   content and directory object to other servers in the site as well as other
   sites if replicas have been created. Attributes that are linked to the public
   folder are also altered by this re-creation, including USN created, USN
   changed, and object Version Number. The folder will have a new creation date.

 - The word "recovered" is appended to the e-mail addresses of that folder such
   as SMTP, X.400, cc:Mail, plus others depending on the connectors installed.

   This could also be an issue if a user is sending mail to the old address by
   replying to a message or if the e-mail address is being stored in either an
   offline address book or personal address book.

   Changing the Display Name of the folder has no effect on the addresses.

 - It resets the public folder replica lists, and they must be re-created.

Additional Information
----------------------

In a public folder, the views are not stored with the folder but are kept in a
separate system folder. These views are referenced by the public folders as a
back link. Therefore, if you recover the folder or move or copy it to a .pst
file, the link back to the view is broken, and views are lost.

This is different from the Views in mailboxes, which are stored as hidden folders
within individual mailboxes. For additional information, click the article
