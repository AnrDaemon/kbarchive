The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to create a batch file to shut down Microsoft Exchange
Server 5.0 or 5.5 more quickly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Quitting Exchange Server services takes a relatively long time when you quit
them as part of the server shutdown process. In some cases, it can take more
than 10 minutes. Because the system attendant acts as a 'central nervous system'
for Exchange Server, with other components dependent on it, quitting the system
attendant before you shut down the server speeds up the process.

1. Create a batch file that has the following lines:

   net stop MSExchangeSA /yes

   net stop MSExchangeSA /yes

   NOTE: Include the duplicate lines to ensure that all dependent services and
   the system attendant shut down.

2. Run the batch file before you shut down the server.

3. Shut down the server.
