PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP6
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP6 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade your computer to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 (SP6), you may
receive a "STOP 0xA" error message on a blue screen on Compaq computers running
the Compaq Network Teaming and Configuration driver (Cpqntac.sys) for Compaq
Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, or Gigabit Network Interface Controllers (NICs) Version
1.00.01.0016 (or earlier).

NOTE: This error message occurs only if you have implemented Compaq Network
Teaming.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the version of the Cpqntac.sys driver is not
compatible with the Windows NT system components that are updated in SP6.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the recovery process outlined on the following Compaq
Web site:

   http://www.compaq.com/support/techpubs/customer_advisories/EM991108_CW01_0.html

To work around this issue, use the appropriate method:

 - Apply the SoftPaq before upgrading to SP6. To download the SoftPaq, refer to
   the following Compaq FTP location:

   ftp://ftp.compaq.com/pub/softpaq/sp11501-12000\sp11718.exe

 - Update the computer to Compaq SSD 2.15a or later.

 - Disable Compaq Network Teaming teaming on the server before you apply SP6.

   NOTE: If you re-enable Compaq Network Teaming after you upgrade to SP6, you
   still receive an error message on a blue screen if you do not update the
   drivers.
