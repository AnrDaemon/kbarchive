TITLE   :SMS: Tracer Tool May Cause Watched Service to Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Systems Management Server Tracer tool to view log files for a
specific Systems Management Server service, the service you are viewing may stop
responding if logging is enabled.

CAUSE
=====

The Tracer tool may cause a sharing violation error message when the service you
are viewing attempts to open the log to insert additional entries. The service
then enters a retry loop waiting to gain access to the log file, which
effectively disables the service.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use an alternative tool to view the log files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
