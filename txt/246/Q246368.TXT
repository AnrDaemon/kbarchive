The information in this article applies to:

 - Interix versions 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to start Interix daemons as services.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can start the following Interix daemons as services:

 - Telnetd

 - Inetd

 - Syslogd

 - Cron1

Microsoft recommends that you start Inetd to start Telnetd, rather than
/bin/telnetd. No other daemon can be started directly as a service, so the
following from /usr/sbin are started only by Inetd:

 - in.fingerd

 - in.ftpd

 - in.ntalkd

 - in.rexecd

 - in.rlogind

 - in.rshd

 - in.telnetd

 - in.tftpd
