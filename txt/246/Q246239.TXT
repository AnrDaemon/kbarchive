TITLE   :XWEB: Unable to Reply to or Forward a Large Message in OWA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2, 3 
 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to reply to or forward a large message that is larger than 30
kilobytes (KB) in Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA), you may receive the
following error message:

   Your message body is too large. Outlook Web Access only supports messages up
   to 100K.

   Please create a new message with a smaller size. Save your edits by cutting
   and pasting them into the new message.

CAUSE
=====

If the message text in the body of the original message is greater than 30 KB in
size, you cannot reply to or forward the message. OWA has a limitation on
message size that is not a restriction in a regular Outlook client.

WORKAROUND
==========

Cut the text of the message and paste it into two or more smaller messages, or
send the text to another recipient as an attachment.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message is actually slightly incorrect. The message limitation for
replying or forwarding occurs around 30 KB rather than 100 KB.
