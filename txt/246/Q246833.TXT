TITLE   :XADM: DXA Sends Add Transaction Instead of a Modify Transaction

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In a mixed Exchange Server and Microsoft Mail (MS Mail) environment where the
Exchange Server computer is configured as the directory synchronization server,
if you modify the network or postoffice portion of the MS Mail address of a
custom recipient, an add transaction may be sent to the MS Mail environment
instead of a modify transaction.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the address-type comparison checks to determine if
the new entry and the record in the Directory Exchange Agent (DXA) mapping table
are from the same NET/PO combination. If the entry is not the same, then an add
transaction is sent for the new entry. If the NET/PO combination does match, a
modify transaction is sent.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, delete the custom recipient and recreate it. When you
need to modify multiple addresses, export the custom recipients to a .csv file.
Delete the existing custom recipients and allow a full directory synchronization
cycle to finish. Then re-import the modified custom recipients and allow another
directory synchronization cycle to finish.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
