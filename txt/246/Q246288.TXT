The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the API Text Viewer to get the declaration for the API
SHFileOperation() function, the following Declare statement is produced:

   Public Declare Function SHFileOperation Lib "shell32.dll" Alias " SHFileOperationA" (lpFileOp As SHFILEOPSTRUCT) As Long

Note that the Declare statement in the code has an embedded space character
before SHFileOperationA. If you use this API in your Visual Basic code, you
receive the following error message when you run your application:

   

   Run-time error '453':

   Can't find DLL entry point  SHFileOperationA in shell32.dll

Note that the extra space is also present in the error message text.

RESOLUTION
==========

The correct Declare statement is:

   Public Declare Function SHFileOperation Lib "shell32.dll" Alias "SHFileOperationA" (lpFileOp As SHFILEOPSTRUCT) As Long

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
