SUMMARY
=======

This article summarizes how INTEREX uses Telnetd.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Interix does not use a Win32 telnet server, but instead uses a port from the
telnetd program from the 4.4 BSD-Lite distribution. This telnet server is much
more robust than the Win32 telnet server native to Microsoft Windows NT.

You can run the telnetd program from a command prompt, or install it as a Windows
NT service. By default, telnetd runs on port 23, the telnet port.

Login Shell: All users log on to the Interix shell /bin/ksh.

Security: Each user runs in the appropriate security context, as if logged on
from the main Windows NT console.

Terminal Emulation: The telnetd has access to the terminfo database. Over one
hundred terminals are described, and new ones may be added.

Connections: The number of connections permitted is determined by the software
license. The maximum is set by the number of pseudo terminals available on the
computer (256 pairs in Interix 2.2, 64 in earlier releases). Note that if other
programs (such as xterm) are using pseudo terminals, fewer are available for
telnetd connections.

Maximum Attempts: The telnetd permits 10 consecutive log on attempts. After the
fourth failure, it sleeps for 5 seconds before prompting. After the fifth, it
sleeps for 10 seconds, then 15, and so on.

If you have installed the pre-release package of Inetd, please see the following
Interix Web site for instructions about how to integrate telnetd with the Inetd
package:
