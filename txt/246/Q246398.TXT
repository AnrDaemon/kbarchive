TITLE   :Help Screens Do Not Display in Compass
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1; WINDOWS:2000
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Help button to display the help screen or click the right
side of a form in Compass, you receive the following error message:

   Proxy Report:
   11001 Host was not found

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the MMS Help uses URLs to locate the help files. This
is an example of a URL that could be called:

   http://server_name.domain.com:8080/resource/help/admin

This error message is generated when a Proxy Server is configured for Microsoft
Internet Explorer and your MMS directory structure has an Internet type name
such as server_name.domain_name.com.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, obtain access to the Internet by using a proxy
server:

1. In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu, and then
   click the Connections tab.

2. Click Lan Settings, click to select the "Use a proxy server" check box, and
   then click Advanced.

3. Add the follow exception to the "Do not use proxy server for addresses
   beginning with" box under Exceptions

   http://<server name>.<domain name>.com

   where <server name> is the server name, and <domain name> is the
   domain name.

   NOTE: To verify you are using the correct URL that the help file is trying to
   contact, right-click the form where the proxy error is displayed, and then
   click Properties. The General tab contains the address, copy the information
   up to the port number. For example:

   http://<server name>.<domain name>.com:8080/resource/help/admin

This information would be the exception.
