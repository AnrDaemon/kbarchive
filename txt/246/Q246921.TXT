TITLE   :HTTP 204 Response Returns Message-Body to Client
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you browse an empty Active Server Pages (ASP) page, a message body is
returned in addition to a 204 response.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. IIS usually returns "friendly" HTTP responses with error
codes. However, in the case of a "204 No Content" error message, this is
different from the HTTP/1.1 specification detailed in the Request For Comment
(RFC) number 2616 as follows:

   "The 204 response MUST NOT include a message-body, and thus is always
   terminated by the first empty line after the header fields."

WORKAROUND
==========

When an empty page needs to be returned to client, use an empty text or HTML
file (for example Empty.txt, Empty.htm, and so on).

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on this topic, please see section 10.2.5 of the HTTP/1.1
specification in RFC 2616 at the following URL:
