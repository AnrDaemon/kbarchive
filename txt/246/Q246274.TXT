TITLE   :XCLN: The Originator Does Not Have Permission to Submit Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send an e-mail message through a Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft
Outlook client of Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0, you may receive the following
non-delivery report (NDR) even though the Delivery Restrictions-Accept From list
correctly lists your mailbox:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   Subject: test
   Sent: 9/30/99 1:01:20 PM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:
   Doe, Jane on 9/30/99 1:01:22 PM

   The originator does not have permission to submit message
   MSEXCH:MSExchangeIS:Machine200:ServerName

Such NDRs may appear randomly, originating from the information store, from the
Internet Mail Service, or from other Microsoft Exchange Server components.

CAUSE
=====

If the intended destination of the message is a .pst file instead of an inbox,
this behavior can occur when the .pst file is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, at the client, reconfigure the account to deliver mail
to an Inbox instead of a personal folder. You can also run the Inbox Repair tool
to attempt to fix the .pst file.
