TITLE   :Windows Clients Cannot Log On to Server Across Router Using IPX
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on to a Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0-based domain
from Microsoft Windows 95-based clients configured with the Novell intraNetWare
Client and Client for Microsoft Networks and using NWLink as the default
protocol, you may receive the following error message:

   No domain controller could be found to validate your logon.

However, you can successfully use these same Windows clients to log on to a
NetWare server on the far side of the router.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the network routers are not configured to propagate
type 20 packets. By default, most routers do not propagate broadcasts. For the
network basic input/output system (NetBIOS) to operate within an NWLink
environment, the routers must be able to propagate NetBIOS packets, which are
packet type 20 (0x14), across the network.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, configure the network routers to propagate type 20
packets (0x14) across the network. For instructions on how to do this, refer to
the documentation from the router manufacturer.

MORE INFORMATION
