======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article delineates the aspects of a Visual SourceSafe stand alone
installation.

When you purchase and install Microsoft Visual SourceSafe as an individual
product (as opposed to getting Visual SourceSafe as part of an Enterprise
Edition product), you are led through the installation process similar to past
install processes.

You are presented with the following three options when installing the individual
box version of Visual SourceSafe:

 - Shared Database Server

 - Custom

 - Stand Alone

MORE INFORMATION
================

Shared Database Server

This option creates a database and installs the admin software and the Netsetup
program so that you can install the client software from the server. Choosing
this option installs the following:

 - Create Database

 - Admin Tools

 - Client Tools

 - Integration components and Registry Settings

 - Help Files

 - Netsetup Image

 - IE4 Setup Image

Custom

This option allows you to select the set of components installed to your
computer. You can choose from the following components:

 - Create Local (or Remote) Database

 - Admin Tools

 - Client Tools

 - Integration components and Registry Settings

 - Netsetup Image

 - IE4 Setup Image

 - Conversion Utilities

 - Help Files

Stand Alone

This options creates a private database on your local computer; it does not
create a Netsetup image.

 - Create Database

 - Admin Tools

 - Client Tools

 - Integration components and Registry Settings

 - Help Files

Use the Shared Database Server when you are creating a database that will be used
by many clients. This Shared Database Server option can be used to install a
database to a local or remote drive. Use the Custom option when you want to
choose the items to install to your computer, and use the stand alone option
when you are setting up a database for individual use.
