SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to identify your CD-ROM and subsystem version in
Interix.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use either of the following methods to identify an Interix subsystem
release:

 - If you have the Interix 2.2 CD-ROM, put it in the CD-ROM drive and view the
   CD-ROM from Microsoft Windows NT Explorer or My Computer to see the CD-ROM
   label.

 - In Windows NT Explorer, locate the Interix subsystem (Psxss.exe) in the
   %WinDir%\System32 folder. To view the version information, on the File menu,
   click Properties, and then click the Version tab.

If the CD-ROM label lists Interix 2.2.3 or later, you already have a system that
works with Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4). If the Psxss.exe file
version is 2.2.203 or later, Windows NT 4.0 SP4 does not cause Interix to stop
working. If the version is 2.2.202 or earlier, you must install Interix 2.2
Service Pack 1 or a patch to correct the issue.
