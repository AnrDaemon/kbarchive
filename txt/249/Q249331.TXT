PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200fix kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Advertisements targeted at Secondary Site Client Collections are not modified to
reflect the deltas in the target collection. Therefore, advertisements may still
be available to clients that you have removed from the intended target
collection.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because Secondary Site Collection Evaluator does not correctly
handle a collection member delta. This prevents Offer Manager on the Secondary
Site from finding out a collection member has been removed from a collection.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
