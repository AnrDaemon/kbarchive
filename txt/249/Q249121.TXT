======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following status message may appear sporadically in the Systems Management
Server (SMS) site database at the central site in a large site hierarchy:

   SMS_COMPONENT_STATUS_SUMMARIZER 620 Microsoft SQL Server reported SQL message
   3902, severity 16: The COMMIT TRANSACTION request has no corresponding BEGIN
   TRANSACTION. Please refer to your SMS documentation, SQL documentation, or
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base for further troubleshooting information.

Thousands of these messages may occur per day, and status summaries for site
systems may be incomplete temporarily, depending on whether the table involved
(Summarizers_Status) in the deadlock was updated in the last attempt.

CAUSE
=====

A deadlock occurs between the Site System Status summarizer and the Component
Status summarizer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

   Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

This condition does not necessarily cause issues with site functionality, but
does cause a large number of status messages to be generated. To work around
this behavior, use either of the following methods.

Method 1
--------

Reduce the frequency of replication for the site system status from each of the
child sites:

1. In the Administrator console, for each site in your hierarchy, expand Site
   Hierarchy, <Site Name>, Site Settings, and Status Summarizers.

2. Right-click Site System Status Summarizer, and then click Properties.

3. Click the Schedule button, and then assign a summarization schedule that
   occurs less often than once an hour. For example, assign a summarization
   schedule that occurs once every eight hours or once each day.

4. Commit the changes.

Method 2
--------

Prevent the status messages from being loaded in the site database or forwarded
to the summarizers with a Status Filter rule:

1. In the Administrator console, for each site where the error message is
   reported, expand Site Hierarchy, <Site Name>, Site Settings, and Status
   Filter Rules.

2. Right-click the Status Filter Rules node, point to New, and then click Status
   Filter Rule.

3. Type a name for the Status Filter rule (for example, "Exclude
   SMS_COMPONENT_STATUS_SUMMARIZER 620 Messages").

4. Click to select the Message ID check box. Type "620" (without the quotation
   marks) in the box to the right.

5. Click the Action tab.

6. Click the following options:

    - "Do not forward to status summarizers"

    - "Do not process lower-priority status filter rules"

7. Click OK.

8. Right-click the new Status Filter rule, point to All Tasks, and then click
   Increment Priority. Repeat this step until the Status Filter rule appears at
   the top of the list. This causes the rule to be processed first, discarding
   any status messages with an ID of 620 before writing them to the database or
   passing them on to the Component Status summarizer.

NOTE: This procedure prevents all messages with an ID of 620 from being written
to the database or tallied by the Component Status summarizer. Use caution when
you configure Status Filter rules to exclude status messages because you may
inadvertently exclude important information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
