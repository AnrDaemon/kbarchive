TITLE   :"Short Date Style" Setting May Not Maintain 4-Digit Year Format
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Microsoft Windows 95 Year 2000 Update and you configure
the Short Date Style setting to a 4-digit year on the Date tab in the Regional
Settings tool in Control Panel, the setting may revert to a 2-digit year setting
when you restart the computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the computer is configured to use user profiles and
the default profile's Short Date Style setting is configured to use a 2-digit
year format. The default setting overrides other profiles if they are configured
to use a 4-digit year setting.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, log on to the default profile and change the format of
the Short Date Style setting to the 4-digit format. Or, start the computer in
Safe mode, which uses the default user profile, and change the Short Date Style
setting to a 4-digit year format.
