SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server client for Microsoft Windows NT fails to find SNA Servers through
the OtherServers Registry parameter if the server names that are listed in the
entry have been configured to use a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server client for Windows NT truncates the Fully Qualified Domain Name
(FQDN) of the servers that are listed in the OtherServers registry parameter so
that only the first 15 characters are used.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.
