TITLE   :XADM: Error Joining an Existing Site Running on Windows 2000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive the following error message when you are running Exchange Server
Setup to join a site that is running on Microsoft Windows 2000 Server:

   No mapping between account names and security IDs was done.
   Microsoft Windows NT
   ID no: 0xc0020534

You receive this error after entering the password for the Exchange Server
service account.

CAUSE
=====

Exchange Server 5.5 only recognizes account entries in the format of
<Domain>\<Account>, not in the <Account>@<Domain.com>
format.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, you must change the Log On account for each of the
Exchange Server services from the <Account>@<Domain.com> format to
the <Domain>\<Account> format. To do so, on the Windows 2000
computer that is running Exchange Server:

1. Open Services from the Administrative Tools program group.

2. Double-click on each of the Exchange Server services.

3. Click the Log On tab.

4. In the This account field, change the account to the
   <Domain>\<Account> format.

The domain in the <Domain>\<Account> format is the NetBIOS domain
name.

The account must be manually typed in in this format, because Windows 2000
automatically enters the account name in the <Account>@<Domain.com>
format.

After you complete the preceding steps, you can complete the installation of
Exchange Server 5.5, and join the site successfully.
