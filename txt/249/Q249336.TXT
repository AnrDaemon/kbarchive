TITLE   :BUG: Error Message When Using Date in Index File
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbvfp600bug kbXBase KbDBFDBC kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an index key expression contains a date in non-strict date format and SET
STRICTDATE TO is set to 1, opening or setting the order on the table may result
in the following error:

   Index does not match the table. Delete the index and re-create the index
   file.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may arise if you convert code from a version of FoxPro that did not
have the STRICTDATE functionality.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, make sure the date is entered in strict date format. In this
case, the index expression would read:

   ddate-{^1910-10-01}

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. From the Tools menu, choose Options. In the Options dialog box, click the
   General tab. Under the "Year 2000 Compliance" section, change the Strict Date
   Level to 0-Off. Press the Set As Default button, and the close the dialog
   box.

2. Create a table with a date field, named ddate, and a character field named
   first.

3. Add some data to both fields. For this example, make sure all the dates have
   a year after 1990.

4. Create an index tag named dtest with an expression like this:

   ddate-{10/01/1910}

5. Save the index, and set the order to the tag you just created with the
   following command:

   SET ORDER TO dtest

6. Close the table by issuing this command in the Command window:

   USE

From the Tools menu, choose Options. In the Options dialog box, click the General
tab. Under the "Year 2000 Compliance" section, change the Strict Date Level to
1-Constants. Press the Set As Default button, and close the dialog box. A Strict
Date Level of 1 is the default value in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

7. Open the table with this command and the error listed in the Symptoms section
   appears:

   USE table_name
