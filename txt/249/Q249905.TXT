TITLE   :Cannot Access SQL Database from Cold Fusion Applications
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Allaire Cold Fusion server software to create Web applications on a
computer running Microsoft SQL Server, you may then not be able to access a
Structured Query Language (SQL) database from those applications. You may
receive either of the following error messages:

   403: Access Forbidden

   or

   404: Object Not found

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because Cold Fusion installs its own version of Open
Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers, which overwrites the SQL ODBC drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, reinstall the ODBC drivers from SQL Server.
