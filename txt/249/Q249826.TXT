SYMPTOMS
========

If the Odbc32.dll file is missing, corrupted, or replaced with an older version,
ASP pages may stop functioning. The following error message may appear in the
event log when an ASP page is requested:

   Event ID 205 Source: WAM
   "HTTP server was unable to load ISAPI application:
   "C:\winnt\system32\inetsrv\asp.dll". The data is the error."

When you using DllRegisterServer (Regsvr32) to re-register Asp.dll, an error
message indicates that the action was not successful, for example:

   The dynamic link library ODBC32.dll cannot be found in the specified path" .;
   C:\winnt\system32; C:\winnt\system; C:\winnt; C:\winnt\system32\; C:\winnt;
   C:\Program Files\Mts.

CAUSE
=====

When you install older versions of database software or middleware, the existing
Odbc32.dll file may be overwritten. DLL version conflicts between Odbc32.dll
files can cause Asp.dll to stop functioning. The same problem can occur if you
accidentally delete or rename the Odbc32.dll file in the Winnt\System32
directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, install the latest version of MDAC to replace the
Odbc32.dll file with the latest version. Download MDAC from the following
location:

Restart the computer if needed.
