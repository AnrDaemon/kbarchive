TITLE   :Schedule+ 7.5 To Do Tab Maps Short Date Style Year Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbYear2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply the year 2000 (Y2K) update for Schedule+ 7.5 and set the Date
format to the Short Date Style MM/dd/yyyy, you start Schedule+ to set up a "To
Do" list for 1/5/0001. When you enter the date for the "To Do" list, you simply
type "1" (without the quotation marks) in the year field. However, when you
press the TAB key to go to the next field, the year changes to 1/1/1900 and is
displayed in red.
