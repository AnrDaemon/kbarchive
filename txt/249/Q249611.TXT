======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 4.1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When a program dynamically links to Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), the MFC
Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) classes use an ODBC environment handle (HENV)
that is declared local to the MFC DLL. Therefore, these programs do not have
access to the MFC HENV.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the MFC ODBC classes are not designed to make the
HENV available to the programmer.

STATUS
======

This problem has been fixed with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.

Use the global MFC function AfxGetHENV to obtain the HENV.
