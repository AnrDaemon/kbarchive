======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are viewing an instruction (.ins) file, Pcmdump.exe detects a year 2000
expiration date of 01/01/00 incorrectly as 01/01/100. The expiration date when
you run the Pcmdump tool against the .ins file is displayed as:

   Expiration Date : 01/01/100 16:11:00

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install this hotfix, replace the hotfixed Pcmdump.exe file in the current
Pcmdump.exe folder structure.

This is not a critical problem because it is a problem only with the Resource Kit
Pcmdump.exe tool. The date is correctly stored in the instruction file and can
be viewed via the job details when you are using the client's Package Command
Manager (Pcmwin32) tool. It displays the year 2000 date correctly as 01/01/00.
