SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Discovery Data Manager (DDM) may stop
processing Discovery Data Records (DDRs) and generate a "Primary key violation"
error message in the Ddm.log file. In the following sample log file excerpt, the
name of the computer being processed is "OPGM-89." Note the space after the name
of the computer being processed.

Status message error:

   SMS_DISCOVERY_DATA_MANAGER 2636 SMS Discovery Data Manager failed to process
   the discovery data record (DDR) "D:\SMS\inboxes\ddm.box\PP9DNM8E.DDR",
   because it cannot update the data source.

After DDM encounters this error, no other DDRs are processed until the problem
DDR is removed from the SMS\Inboxes\DDM.box folder. This can cause a large
backlog of DDRs, and over time can also cause high CPU usage.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is caused by Network Discovery discovering a workstation that
contains a space at the end of its NetBIOS name. Microsoft Windows NT-based
clients do not allow you place a space at the end of the name. It is possible to
encounter this problem with Windows NT-based workstations that are not running
Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, determine which client has a name with a space at
the end and remove the space from the workstation's NetBIOS name. To determine
which client is causing this problem:

1. Check the Ddm.log file to determine the name of the workstation. You see a
   line just before the "Primary Key error" message similar to:

   ==>Name = <OPGM-81 >

The name between the brackets is the name of the workstation.

2. Stop the SMS_Executive service on the site server.

3. Find the problem DDR in the SMS\Inboxes\DDM.box folder by performing a text
   search on all files containing the computer name. In this example, search for
   "<OPGM-81 >".

4. Delete all DDRs that you locate with this search.

5. On the workstation itself, remove the space from the end of the NetBIOS name.

You may have to delete multiple DDRs from the DDM.box folder, depending on how
many times the workstation has been discovered.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
