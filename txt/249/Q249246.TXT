PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade the Dispatch.exe program for Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA
for Windows NT (NT MMTA) to version 3.5.23 or later, if you use DrivesUNC
statements in the Dispatch.ini file and run the Dispatch program from the
command line, the following error message is displayed:

   Drive is either local, used or greater than lastdrive.

CAUSE
=====

Version 3.5.23 of the Dispatch.exe program was changed to accept drive letters
so that the Dispatch program and the External program can use drives from
different pools of drives.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the drive letter or range to the following line in the Dispatch.ini file:

   DrivesDynamic=<drive letter or range>

In the following example TV is the drive range, but you can use any free drive
letters:

   [dispatch]
   DrivesDynamic=tv
   Drivesunc=\\server\share
   Drivesunc=\\server\share
