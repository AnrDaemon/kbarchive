PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When clients of Terminal Server attempt to run any program, they may be unable
to do so and they may receive an error message stating that the system cannot
find the Files32.vxd file.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because of a virus named Pretty Park, which inserts the
'Files32.vxd' statement at the beginning of the string value of the following
registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\Exefile\Shell\Open\Command

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, remove the 'files32.vxd' statement from the beginning
of the registry string value on the computer running Terminal Server. Follow
these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32).

2. In the registry, locate the following key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\Exefile\Shell\Open\Command

3. In the right pane of the Registry Editor window, double-click the following
   unnamed registry string value:

<NO NAME>: REG_SZ: "files32.vxd" "%1"%*

4. In the String box, remove the files32.vxd statement from the string. The
   correct string for this key is:

"%1"%*

5. Click OK, and then quit Registry Editor.

6. Restart the Terminal Server computer.

NOTE: When you run the Regedit.exe file, you may experience the symptoms
described earlier in this article. To work around this issue, rename the
Regedit.exe file to Regedit.com, and then follow the instructions in this
article. After you are finished, rename the Regedit.com file back to
Regedit.exe.
