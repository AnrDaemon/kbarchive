TITLE   :XADM: Error in Mailbox Manager Documentation on IPM.Note
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The documentation for the Mailbox Manager in Exchange Server version 5.5 Service
Pack 3, the Mbmanug.htm file, erroneously lists IPM.Note as a non-mail Outlook
class in the following paragraph from that file:

   Message Classes
   The Message Class feature allows you to exclude certain message classes from
   deletion. For example, you might not want any contacts to be deleted,
   regardless of age, or size of the contact item. To exclude a message class,
   click Message Classes. The Message Classes dialog box opens. Type the name of
   the class you want to exclude and click Add each time. The standard non-mail
   Outlook classes are IPM.Appointment, IPM.Task, IPM.Contact, IPM.Activity,
   IPM.Note, IPM.Post, and IPM.StickyNote. Administrators who do not wish to
   delete contacts or calendar items add IPM.Contact and IPM.Appointment to the
   list of Excluded Message Classes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IPM.Note is a standard mail message class. The standard non-mail Outlook classes
are IPM.Appointment, IPM.Task, IPM.Contact, IPM.Activity, IPM.Post, and
IPM.StickyNote.
