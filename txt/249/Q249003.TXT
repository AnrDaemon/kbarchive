TITLE   :DHCP Clients Receive Identical IP and Default Gateway Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you release or renew a DHCP client or when you lease an IP address during
startup on a switched network, you may receive an IP address and default gateway
address that are identical.

For example, if your computer is supposed to use the following IP addresses

   IP address: 192.168.0.15
   Default Gateway: 192.168.0.1

you may actually receive identical addresses:

   IP address: 192.168.0.15
   Default Gateway: 192.168.0.15

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the setting on the Auto Gateway Control or Auto
Broadcast Control switch is turned on.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact the manufacturer of your Ethernet switch.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If the settings on the Auto Gateway Control or Auto Broadcast Control switch are
turned on, then the DHCPOFFER packet is stripped down, which changes the default
gateway to the same address as the IP address.
