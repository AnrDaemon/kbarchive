KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run ASP pages using a Microsoft Remote Data Service (RDS) connection to
a database, the following error message may appear in the browser:

   8447: Internet Server Error

The same error message appears if you run the Adctest.asp sample file.

CAUSE
=====

This error message may be caused by one of the following:

 - The virtual directory for RDS in the Default Web Site has been removed.

-OR-

 - RDS was not installed properly.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the physical files for RDS still exist and only the virtual directory for RDS
was accidentally removed, use the following steps to restore the RDS virtual
directory:

1. Re-create the virtual directory named MSADC in the Default Web Site using the
   wizard. Map this virtual directory to <drive letter>:\Program
   Files\Common Files\System\Msadc. Enable Read and Execute (including Script)
   permissions.

2. Right-click the virtual directory that you just created, and the select
   Properties. On the Virtual Directory tab, select Application Settings, and
   then click the Remove to delete any name in the Name box and point the
   application starting point to the Default Web Site. The Create button will
   now be available.

3. Stop and start the Default Web Site.

4. In Windows NT Explorer, check the physical file and folder permissions for
   Program Files\Common Files\System\Msadc. The minimum permissions should be
   Everyone: READ.

5. Test ASP with RDS. You can use the Adctest.asp sample file included with the
   IIS in the <drive letter>:\Program Files\Common
   Files\System\Msadc\Samples directory.

If RDS is not installed correctly or the physical files in the Program
Files\Common Files\System\Msadc directory are corrupted, RDS can be installed
independently. For information on RDS, please see the following Web page:

   http://www.microsoft.com/data/ado/rds/

The version included with the Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP) is Microsoft Data
Access Components (MDAC) version 1.5 with RDS version 1.5. Because RDS is part
of MDAC, it is recommended that you upgrade MDAC if RDS needs to be
reinstalled.

For the latest information on MDAC, please see the following Web site:
