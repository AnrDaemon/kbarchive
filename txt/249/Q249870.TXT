======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 (SP3), you cannot access
the client permissions on the Internet Newsgroups folder and you receive the
following error message:

   The object cannot be found in the directory. This may be because replication
   has not completed.

   Microsoft Exchange Directory
   ID no: c1010aae

CAUSE
=====

Although Internet Newsgroups is a special folder and there is no directory
object for it, the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program seeks a
directory object for it to check the Administrator permissions.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft

version 5.5 SP3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
