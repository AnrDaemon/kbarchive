SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Host Account Synchronization service, also known as SNAHOSTPROCESS, is
only required if automatic password synchronization is being used. This service
is not necessary when using Single Sign-On (SSO) with manual password updates.

If the SNAHOSTPROCSS is not being used (not installed or disabled), but the Host
Account Manager (UDConfig.exe) is set up to replicate passwords, then anytime an
end user changes their Windows NT password, the following event is recorded in
the Event Viewer Application log:

   Event 1314 - Type:Warning

   Unable to locate a requested resource Supplied code 0x0

In a large client-install base where end users need to change their Windows NT
passwords daily (typically due to account policy rules), it is very likely that
there will be multiple occurrences of event 1314 in the Application log of the
Event Viewer.

CAUSE
=====

When an end user changes their Windows NT password, the SNA Password Management
Process (SNAPMP) attempts to locate the SNAHOSTPROCESS to pass the new Windows
NT password to the AS/400 or host system. This attempt is made because the Host
Account Manager is configured to replicate passwords. If the SNAHOSTPROCSS
service is not installed or disabled, an event 1314 is logged to indicate that
it could not locate the resource.

RESOLUTION
==========

If password synchronization is not needed, Microsoft recommends that you
configure the Host Account Manager for mapped entries, instead of replicated
entries. For example, if you are viewing the Host Account Manager:

   Use Windows NT Password = Replicated
   Use This Password = Mapped
