The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Personal Web Server version 4.0 for NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Personal Web Server version 4.0 for Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Personal Web Server version 4.0 for Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you install Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.00 on Windows NT servers,
four types of IIS logging formats are provided (MMC, Web site Properties, Web
Site tab, Active Log format):

 - Microsoft IIS Log file Format
 - NCSA Common Log File Format
 - W3C Extended Log File Format(default)
 - ODBC Logging

When Microsoft Peer Web Server (PWS) is installed on a Windows NT workstation or
Windows95/98 computers, only the first three log formats are listed under Web
site Properties, and there is no ODBC Logging format for PWS.

This is a product design feature.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PWS installed on Windows NT workstation (or Windows95/98) does not provide the
same full functionality as IIS installed on Windows NT server, although the
installation may use the same NTOP CD or Visual Studio CD packet.

IIS ODBC Logging feature requires server communication and an authentication
mechanism supported only on Windows NT servers.

Please refer to PWS Release Notes along with the PWS installation guide (or on
the CD) for more information on other differences between PWS and IIS.

Additional query words: PWS, NTW, IIS4, Logging format, ODBC
