SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to delete the Internet Mail Service (IMS) object in
raw mode when the usual methods of deletion, such as using Setup to remove the
object or selecting the object in the Exchange Server Administrator program and
pressing DELETE, do not work.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin
-r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

1. Open Exchange Administrator in raw mode:

   a. At the Microsoft Windows NT command prompt, change to the drive and folder
      where Exchange Administrator resides:

   X:\exchsrvr\bin

   b. Type the following at the command line:

   admin -r

2. Select the IMS object, select the Edit menu, and then select Delete Raw
   Object.
