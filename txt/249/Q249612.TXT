TITLE   :XCLN: Auto Name Check Does Not Work After Running Exmerge
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Microsoft Exmerge utility to re-create and populate the
Information Store, the automatic name checking feature on the Microsoft Outlook
Contacts folder may not work.

CAUSE
=====

When you create a new Information Store, a new set of mailbox folders is
created. The automatic name checking feature is linked to the Contacts folder of
the previous Information Store. When this link is broken, the automatic name
checking feature does not work.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, add the new Contacts folder to the Outlook Address Book:

1. In Outlook, right-click the Contacts folder, and then click Properties.

   NOTE: The Contacts folder is created automatically the first time the user
   logs on to the mailbox in Outlook.

2. On the Outlook Address Book tab, click to select the "Show this folder as an
   e-mail Address Book" check box.

3. Click OK.

4. On the Tools menu, click Services.

5. On the Services tab, click Outlook Address Book, and then click Properties.

6. Click the old Contacts folder, and then click "Remove Address Book".

7. Click OK.

8. On the Tools menu, click Services, click the Addressing tab, and then click
   Add.

9. In the Address List box, click the new Address Book you created in step two,
   and then click Add.

10. Click OK.
