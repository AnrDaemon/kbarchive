SYMPTOMS
========

You may get an invalid page fault error message when you close your application
if you have accessed certain properties of the Microsoft Scripting Run-Time
Objects in your code. The details of the error message start as follows:

   [AppName] caused an invalid page fault in module SCRRUN.DLL at 0137:6b801185.

[AppName] is the name of the executable. So, if you are running the compiled EXE,
[AppName] is the name of your EXE, and if you run the project from the IDE,
[AppName] is the Visual Basic executable, either VB5.exe or VB6.exe. The memory
address and offset at the end of the message may vary.

CAUSE
=====

The error message occurs if you have version 5.x of the Scrrun.dll file and your
operating system is Microsoft Windows 95. The error does not occur on Microsoft
Windows 98, Windows Me, Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 2000-based computers,
or with version 4.x of the Scrrun.dll file.
