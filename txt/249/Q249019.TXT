TITLE   :XCLN: Opening Attach. in Public Folders in Exchange Client 5.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Exchange Client 5.0 with Microsoft Word Mail set as your default
e-mail editor, if messages in a public folder have been copied or dragged from
another folder and you only have Author permission (read-only) on the folder in
which the messages are located, you may not be able to open attachments in those
messages.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because when you have only Author permission on a public
folder, all messages in that folder, including attachments, are regarded as
read-only. When Word Mail is set as your default e-mail editor and you attempt
to open a message in a public folder where you only have Author access, the
Exchange Client passes a flag to Word that signals that the file should be
opened in protected mode. When Word opens files in protected mode, in-line
objects cannot be edited. This behavior is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use one of the following five methods:

 - Use floating objects for the attachments instead of in-line attachments.

 - Use Outlook; Outlook ignores the instructions to open the document in protect
   mode and assigns read-only permission based on the file system.

 - Select the attachment, copy it, and then paste it to a folder on the local
   hard disk.

 - On the File menu, click Save As to save a copy of the attachment locally.

 - Post the message to the folder, rather than dragging the message from another
   folder.
