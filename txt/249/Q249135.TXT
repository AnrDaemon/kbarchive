SUMMARY
=======

You cannot apply the 56-bit (standard encryption) version of Service Pack 6 or
6a to a version of Windows NT 4.0 that is running a 128-bit (high encryption)
version of a service pack.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you attempt to apply the 56-bit (standard encryption) version of Service Pack
6 or 6a to a version of Windows NT 4.0 that is running a 128-bit (high
encryption) version of a service pack, you receive the following error message:

   You have chosen to install a version of the Service Pack with Standard
   Encryption onto a system with High Encryption. This is not supported. To
   successfully install this version of the Service Pack, you must install the
   High Encryption version. Press help for more information about obtaining the
   High Encryption version of this Service Pack. Service Pack setup will now
   exit.

In earlier service packs, installing a lower-encryption service pack generates an
error message stating that you are about to downgrade the level of security, but
you can install standard encryption over high encryption. In Service Pack 6/6a,
you cannot do so.
