TITLE   :XWEB: Appointments Created in OWA Appear Shifted One Hour Ahead
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5,5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Outlook Web Access (OWA) to create appointments that fall in the
seven days before the last Sunday in October of any given year, the start and
end times may appear to be shifted one hour ahead if you view them by using
Microsoft Outlook. For some time zones this may also happen for dates in the
seven days before the last Sunday in September. In some cases the appointments
are also displayed incorrectly in OWA even though they were created there.

CAUSE
=====

In 1996, the European Union (EU) standardized a EU-wide daylight saving period
that starts on the last Sunday in March and ends on the last Sunday in October.
Before the standardization, some EU countries implemented a daylight saving time
that ended on the last Sunday in September. The Collaboration Data Objects (CDO)
libraries didn't implement this change properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
