======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Hot keys for buttons defined on a ToolBar control, from the Microsoft Common
Controls ActiveX control (mscomctl.ocx), that are used in a Visual FoxPro form
are not active when the form is executed.

CAUSE
=====

The ToolBar ActiveX control does not have SetFocus, GotFocus, or LostFocus
events and thus cannot receive focus. Since the ToolBar ActiveX control cannot
receive focus, pressing the ALT key plus the underlined character of the ToolBar
button(s) has no effect.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways you can work around this issue.

 - Issue an ON KEY LABEL command similar to the following code snippet:

   ON KEY LABEL ALT+A _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.buttonclick(_SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.BUTTONS(1))
   ON KEY LABEL ALT+B _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.buttonclick(_SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.BUTTONS(2))

-or-

 - Another, somewhat more cumbersome workaround for this issue involves checking
   for KeyPress events in the KeyPress method of a form, similar to the
   following code snippet:

   DO CASE
      CASE nKeyCode=30
         THISFORM.olecontrol1.buttonclick(THISFORM.olecontrol1.BUTTONS(1))
      CASE nKeyCode=48
         THISFORM.olecontrol1.buttonclick(THISFORM.olecontrol1.BUTTONS(2))
   ENDCASE

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form and add a Microsoft ToolBar ActiveX control.

2. Right-click the ToolBar ActiveX control, and then select the ToolBar
   Properties menu option.

3. Click the Buttons tab of the ToolBar Properties dialog box.

4. Click Insert Button and insert &Alpha in the Caption text box.

5. Click Insert Button again and enter &Beta in the Caption text box.

6. Click the Apply command button.

7. Click the OK command button to close the ToolBar Properties dialog box.

8. Open the ButtonClick method of the ToolBar control and add the following
   code:

   DO CASE
      CASE BUTTON.INDEX=1
         WAIT WINDOW "Alpha" NOWAIT
      CASE BUTTON.INDEX=2
         WAIT WINDOW "Beta" NOWAIT
   ENDCASE

9. Save and run the form. Click the Alpha and Beta keys of the ToolBar control
   and note that the wait window messages display.

10. Press ALT+A, and then press ALT+B. Note that no wait window messages appear.

11. Add the following code to the Load method of the form:

   ON KEY LABEL ALT+A _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.buttonclick(_SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.BUTTONS(1))
   ON KEY LABEL ALT+B _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.buttonclick(_SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.BUTTONS(2))

12. Add the following code to the Unload method of the form:

   ON KEY LABEL ALT+A
   ON KEY LABEL ALT+B
