SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on after restarting a Microsoft Cluster Server-based
computer, you may receive the following error message:

   Event 5719:
   No Windows NT Domain Controller is available for domain [domain_name].
   The following error occurred:
   There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request.

CAUSE

This behavior can occur when the WINS Client (TCP/IP) protocol is bound to the
internal network adapter. This adapter is only for clustering.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, disable the binding between the WINS Client (TCP/IP)
protocol and the internal network adapter.
