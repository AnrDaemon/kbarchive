MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 51: Figure 3.10 Incorrectly Shows One Alpine Ski Center Contact
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Figure 3.10 shows Alpine Ski Center with one contact. The exercise on pages 49
and 50 have instructions for adding two contacts for that company.

Figure 3.10 should list two Alpine Ski Center items: Mike Nash and James Allard.


page 60: Incorrect Default Form Name
------------------------------------

On page 60, under "Specify the Default Form for the Folder", step 3 should read
"...click Beta Contact", not "...click Beta Contacts". Beta Contacts is an
option you can select, but it does not contain the new form, which was created
in the preceding pages.

Change:
"3. In the When Posting To This Folder, Use list box, click Beta Contacts, and
then click OK."

To:
"3. In the When Posting To This Folder, Use list box, click Beta Contact, and
then click OK."


Page 563: NameSpace Property Cannot Be Set to FAT
-------------------------------------------------

On page 563, in the chart, modify the description for "NameSpace" as follows.

Change:
"This property can be set to MAPI (the default), representing the Outlook data
source, or FAT representing the Windows file system."

To:
"Currently this property can only be set to MAPI, which allows access to the
Outlook data source."
