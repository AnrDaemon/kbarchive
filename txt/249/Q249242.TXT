TITLE   :The Active Log Format Drop-Down List Box in ISM Is Empty
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbiis400

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the metabase. Before you edit the metabase, verify that you have a backup copy that can be restored if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Configuration Backup/Restore" Help topic in Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade from Internet Information Server 3.0 to 4.0 or install the
Windows NT Option Pack, the Active Log Format drop-down list box in Internet
Service Manager appears empty. The problem persists even if you have
reregistered the DLL files as specified in the following Microsoft Knowledge
Base article:

   Q183733 Active Log Format Drop-down List Is Not Populated After Upgrading to
   IIS 4.0

CAUSE
=====

The LM/service name/Info/LogModuleList key in the metabase for the service does
not match the string found in the key with the subkey names of the
LM/Logging/log format. These strings are case-sensitive.

RESOLUTION
==========

The process displays information in the Active Log Format drop-down list,
whether or not the correct registration of the DLL and OCX files has occurred as
specified in Q183733.

WARNING: Editing the metabase incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall any product that uses the metabase. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from incorrectly editing the metabase can be
solved. Edit the metabase at your own risk.

NOTE: You should always back up the metabase before you edit it.

The subkeys of LM/Logging/log format should contain the Clsid (such as
A9E69610-B80D-11D0-B9B9-00A0C922E750) for the LogModuleId and the LogModuleUiID
options in order to load the right key in the registry. You must also register
Iislog.dll, Logui.ocx, and Iscomlog.dll. In this case, the Properties button
displays each log format.
