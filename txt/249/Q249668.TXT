TITLE   :XADM: Microsoft Exchange Unavailable in Windows 2000 Backup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2000; winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the backup program that is included with Microsoft Windows 2000
Server on a Windows 2000 Server-based computer that is running Exchange Server
5.5, it may appear that the backup program does not recognize that Exchange
Server is installed, and the Microsoft Exchange check box is displayed as
unavailable (dimmed) when you try to select it to enable Exchange Server backup.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, double-click Microsoft Exchange (double-click the
words Microsoft Exchange, not the Microsoft Exchange check box). After you do,
you can click to expand the folder hierarchy under Microsoft Exchange.
Information that reflects your organization is displayed, and you can select the
components that you want to back up.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 2000 Server.
