TITLE   :SMS: Getsfwr.exe Does Not Report the File Date During Inventory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbYear2000 kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbInventory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the properties of an inventoried software (in Properties, click
the Packages icon), the Date attribute is empty. The verbose output of the
inventory phase also reports the following information:

   Found PACKAGE_NAME, at X:\DIR #1 Date 01/01/100 09:18 Size 256 Len = 283

The date (year) is incorrect.

This issue occurs when Getsfwr.exe (16-bit clients) inventories files with a date
equal to or greater than 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported software update that corrects this problem is now available from
Microsoft, but it has not been fully regression tested and should be applied
only to systems experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely
affected by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the
next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this software update.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the software update. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support
Services phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the
following address on the World Wide Web:

The English-language version of this software update should have the following
file attributes or later:

   Date      Time   Version    Size     File name     Platform
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   03/09/00  xx:xx  786        33,632   Getsfwr.exe   x86

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent update or feature that
contains the above files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in Systems Management Server version
1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install this software update site-wide, replace the existing version of the
Getsfwr.exe file on the Systems Management Server site server, in the following
folder:

   Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin

The files are replicated at the next Maintenance Manager work cycle to all
Systems Management Server logon servers to the Sms\Logon.srv\X86.bin folder.
After the files are replicated, the clients can be updated. Then you can open
and save the System.map file in the Sms folder. For additional information about
