Server (IIS), the Internet Information Services - objects counter increases
unexpectedly. This occurs only when all of the following conditions are met:

 - Your are using Windows NT Challenge/Response to secure the Web site.

 - Default document mapping is used.

Note that the counter never decreases until you stop the Iisadmin service.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, do one of the following:

 - Secure all documents except the default document.

-or-

 - Do not use default document mapping.

The counter will then behave as expected.

   01/21/00  22:21   4.02.0738    383.760 W3svc.dll     alpha



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the home directory of a Web site and the default document are secured with
Windows NT Challenge/Response, and the default document is implicitly loaded
(without the default document name specified in the URL), the Internet
Information Services - objects counter increases by one for requests to the
default document. The counter never decreases.

This is not a memory leak, but a problem setting the counter to the correct
value.
