======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a host print job sends a line of print data with a Carriage Return (CR) and
Line Feed (LF), print server may swap these control characters such that the
printer receives the LF followed by the CR.

Under normal circumstances, this does not cause any problems with the actual
print output. However, if the print job is sent to an application (instead of a
printer) that parses the data, problems could occur if the application expects
to receive the CR and LF in a specific order.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server print service swaps the order of a CR and LF if the print data
caused the specified Maximum Print Position (MPP) to be reached before the CR
and LF commands are received.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3.
