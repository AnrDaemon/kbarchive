SUMMARY
=======

Normally, a mail exchanger (MX) record is used in a Domain Name System (DNS) to
allow other Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) senders to locate the Internet
Mail Service for incoming e-mail. If you cannot create an MX record, you can
accept e-mail as either <user>@<server>.<domain>.com or
<user>@<IPaddress>, in accordance with the IPv4 literals
requirements of Request for Comments (RFC) 821. This article explains how to
accept e-mail as either <user>@<server>.<domain>.com or
<user>@<IPaddress>.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are the requirements to accept e-mail as
<user>@<server>.<domain>.com or
<user>@<IPaddress>, as applicable:

 - To accept mail as <user>@<server>.<domain>.com, you need an
   address record, also known as an A record, for the server in the DNS.

 - To accept mail as <user>@<IPaddress>, you need a computer running
   Exchange Server 5.5 and a static IP address for the Exchange Server computer.

Set up the Internet Mail Service to accept connections for the appropriate IP or
DNS record:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the site Configuration
   container, and then click Connections.

2. Click the Internet Mail Service for the server and open the Internet Mail
   Service properties.

3. Click the Routing tab.

4. Make sure that "Reroute incoming SMTP mail" is selected.

5. Add an entry for either <server>.<domain>.com or for the IP
   address, and then click to select the Should accept as inbound check box.

6. Click OK to close the Internet Mail Service properties.

Set up users with e-mail addresses of <user>@<IPaddress> or
<user>@<hostname>:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the site Configuration
   container, and then click Site Addressing.

2. Open the Site Addressing property page and click the Site Addressing tab.

3. Change the default SMTP address to <servername>.<domain>.com or
   the IP address.
   This changes the SMTP addresses of all of the users. To set up multiple proxy
   addresses for all of the users, you need to either edit user addresses
   individually, or use an import file format that adds an SMTP secondary proxy
   address.

For additional information about this import file format, click the article

4. Click OK to close the Site Addressing property page.

IMPORTANT: You may not be able to deliver mail to some servers without a DNS
entry for your server. For additional information, click the article number
