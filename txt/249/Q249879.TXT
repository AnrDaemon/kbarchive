following message appears:

   Invalid page fault in module VB6.exe at <address>.

CAUSE

Visual Basic is configured to load the Source Code Control Add-in when the
program is started, but Ssscc.dll is not correctly registered in the system
registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use one of the following two methods to resolve this issue:

 - If Microsoft Visual SourceSafe is integrated with Visual Basic:

   Click Start, and then click Run. Type the following commands in the text box:

   regsvr32 "<x>:\<path>\ssscc.dll"

   where <x>:\<path> is the location of the Ssscc.dll file

 - If Microsoft Visual SourceSafe is not integrated with Visual Basic:

   1. Start Visual Basic.

   2. From the Add-Ins menu, click Add-In-Manager.

   3. Under Available Add-Ins, select Source Code Control.

   4. In the Loaded Behavior option box, clear the Loaded/Unloaded and Load on
      Startup check boxes.

   5. Exit Visual Basic.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Source Code Control integrates Visual SourceSafe with Visual Basic.

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

1. Install Visual Basic and Visual SourceSafe.

2. Unregister Ssscc.dll.

3. Launch Visual Basic, and then quit the program.
