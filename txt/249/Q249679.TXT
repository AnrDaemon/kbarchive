SYMPTOMS
========

Outlook 2000 is open and you send a Microsoft Word document to a mail recipient
using the Send To and Mail Recipient options on the Word File menu. If you
cancel the process and decide to save the document, that document becomes a mail
message.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs as the file is saved, the message header is added to it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid the behavior described in the "Symptoms" section, when you are prompted
to save the document, choose not to. However, if you have already chosen to save
the file, when you open it again, it looks like a mail message. You can return
the mail message to a Word document format by using either of the two following
methods:

 - On the File menu, click Save As, and save the file in Rich Text Format. Then
   reopen the file, and save it as a Word document.

-or-

 - On the File menu, click Send To, click Mail Recipient, click File, click
   Close, and then click Yes.
