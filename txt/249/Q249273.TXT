KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a user in an Exchange Server organization sends mail that has recipients in
the Bcc box to a recipient across the Internet Mail Service, the users in the
Bcc box appear in the ImCr EwLs section of the Archive file. This happens if the
Message Archival category is set to Medium or higher on the Diagnostics Logging
tab of the Internet Mail Service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if a user whose e-mail name is someone@microsoft.com sends a
message to a user whose e-mail name is touser@adventureworks.expedia.com and
that message has bccuser@adventureworks.expedia.com in the Bcc box, the header
information of the generated Archive file contains the address
bccuser@adventureworks.expedia.com between the ImCr and EwLs sections of the
header.

The example companies, organizations, products, people, and events depicted
herein are fictitious. No association with any real company, organization,
product, person, or event is intended or should be inferred.
