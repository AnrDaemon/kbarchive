SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 for Terminal Server and you are
using Metaframe 1.8 or earlier, you may have trouble using the Insert File
feature in Microsoft Office programs (such as Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft
Word). You can insert files from the network, but if you connect to Terminal
Server and try to insert a file from a locally mapped drive, you may receive any
of the following error messages:

   System can't find file specified.

or

   Access denied.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because a regression with Mup.sys was introduced in
Terminal Server Service Pack 5.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack



If you do not have Microsoft distributed file system (Dfs) installed, you can
replace the Terminal Server Service Pack 5 version of the Mup.sys file with the
Terminal Server Service Pack 4 version of the Mup.sys file.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server
Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition Service Pack 6.
