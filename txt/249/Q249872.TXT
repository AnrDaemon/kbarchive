TITLE   :Cannot Remotely Edit Windows 95/98 Registry with Regedit/Poledit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv win95 win98

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are unable to use Regedit or Poledit from a Windows NT-based computer to
remotely edit the registry on a Windows 95-based or Windows 98-based computer
running the Remote Registry service.

CAUSE
=====

If you perform a network trace of the problem, you can see that Regedit and
Poledit do not send a name query for the computer name with the correct NetBIOS
suffix appended.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use Regedt32.exe instead of other registry tools.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Regedt32 initially tries to resolve the name without the suffix but if that
action is unsuccessful, Regedt32 tries again with the correct name. For example,
if you try to connect to a computer called Test98, the following names are
attempted:

 - Regedit or Poledit only attempt Test98.

 - Regedt32 attempts Test98 and then Test98 <00>.


Additional query words: win98 remote registry regedt32
