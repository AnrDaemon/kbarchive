SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT Server version 4.0 Service Pack 4 (and later), the
proxy addresses for directory entries that contain the following two Eastern
European characters are modified to random values:

 - The Latin small letter z with caron (unicode 017e) is no longer converted to
   z.

 - The Latin capital letter Z with caron (unicode 017d) is no longer converted
   to Z.

CAUSE
=====

In Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 4 (and later), the two characters in the
"Symptoms" section of this article from CP 1250 (Central Europe) have been added
to CP 1252 (Latin I).
