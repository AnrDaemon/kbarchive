When you query a Systems Management Server (SMS) component, you receive
inaccurate results.

and "Resolve property strings" option are enabled. To configure these options:

1. Right-click any package or component, click Show Messages, and then click
   All.

2. Click Options on the View menu.

3. Click the General tab and click to select the "Resolve description strings"
   check box and the "Resolve property strings" check box.
