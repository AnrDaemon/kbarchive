TITLE   :XADM: Setup Stops When Installing Exchange 5.5 on Windows 2000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2000; winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Exchange Server version 5.5 on a computer running Windows 2000
Advanced Server and join an existing Exchange Server 5.5 site, setup may stop
responding during directory replication. The following event may be displayed in
the Windows 2000 Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 1005
   Type: Error
   Microsoft Exchange Directory ID: c1010aae
   Unexpected error 0xc0040000. The object cannot be found in the directory. This
   may be because replication has not completed.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server service account does not have the required permissions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, add the Exchange Server service account to the local
Power Users group or local Administrators group on a member server. On a domain
controller, add the account to the built-in Administrators group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The minimum rights necessary for the Exchange Server service account on a member
server are Power Users rights. However, if installation problems occur when you
use the local Power Users group, add the Exchange Server service account to the
local Administrators group. Also, if the local Power Users group is not
available because of the type of installation that was performed, use the local
Administrators group.

Additional query words: 0xc0040000, event id: 1005, c1010aae
