TITLE   :XFOR: Using a Verisign Certificate with Exchange Server SSL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you set up Exchange Server to use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for Internet
protocols such as Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol (SMTP), Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3), and Internet Message
Access Protocol (IMAP), you may want to use a certificate that you obtained from
another source, such as Verisign.

You only need to have one certificate for each fully qualified domain name
(FQDN). If you obtained a certificate from Verisign, perhaps for use with
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), you can also use the certificate
for Exchange Server if it is running on the same computer.

You need to know the password for the original certificate request to install the
certificate.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you install the certificate on IIS, you can install the certificate in the
same way for the Exchange Server protocols by using the Key Manager utility. For
additional information about how to create a request and install a certificate,

If the original key file was misplaced, you can create a backup:

1. Start Key Manager, click Key, click Export Key, and then click Backup File.

2. Save the key to a file.

3. For each Exchange Server protocol, click Key, click Import Key, and then
   click Backup File.

4. Type the password for the original certificate.
