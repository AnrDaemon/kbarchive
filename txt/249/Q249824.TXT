The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

VOLTRACK is unloaded and may cause Windows to display a blue screen after 255
device additions and removals.

CAUSE
=====

VOLTRACK keeps a count of the number of devices it is attached to in an internal
byte-size variable. This variable is incremented in response to a AEP_CONFIG_DCB
command, but is not decremented. After 255 additions and removals, the byte
overflows and VOLTRACK is unloaded in response to a AEP_BOOT_COMPLETE command
from IOS. This can cause driver memory to be overwritten and can cause system
instability.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
