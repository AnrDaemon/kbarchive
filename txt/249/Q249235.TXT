SUMMARY
=======

The MSDN documentation for AfxLoadLibrary indicates that you need to use
AfxLoadLibrary if your MFC application uses multiple threads; this is not
totally correct.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The only time you need to use AfxLoadLibrary is if you application is
multithreaded and you are dynamically loading an MFC extension DLL. To load and
unload regular DLLs you can use the Win32 functions LoadLibrary and FreeLibrary.
Only when you are loading and unloading MFC extension DLLs in a multithreaded
application do you need to use AfxLoadLibrary and AfxFreeLibrary.

If you use AfxLoadLibrary in your application and link statically to MFC then you
will get a complier error:

   error C2065: 'AfxLoadLibrary' : undeclared identifier

This is because the header file for AfxLoadLibrary, Afxdll_.h, is only included
if MFC is linked to the application as a DLL. This is by design because you have
to link to the DLL version of MFC to use or create extension DLLs.
