KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Exchange Server Setup on a member server may not work and you may receive the
following error message:

   While attempting to start the Microsoft Exchange Event Service, the following
   error was encountered:
   The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely
   fashion
   Microsoft Windows NT
   ID no:0xc002041D

The Windows 2000 or Windows NT Event Viewer may display the following Event ID:

   Event ID: 4
   Category: General
   Source: MSexchangeES
   Type: Error
   Description: An unexpected OS error occurred. Error Returned was [5].
   Access Denied

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server service account does not have the required permissions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, add the Exchange Server service account to the local
Power Users group or local Administrators group on a member server. On a domain
controller, add the account to the built-in Administrators group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The minimum rights necessary for the Exchange Server service account on a member
server are Power Users rights. However, if installation problems occur when you
use the local Power Users group, add the Exchange Server service account to the
local Administrators group. Also, if the local Power Users group is not
available because of the type of installation that was performed, use the local
Administrators group.
