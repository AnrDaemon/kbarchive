TITLE   :XWEB: Calendar Date Doesn't Change if Date Selected w/Scroll Bar
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2, 3 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Outlook Web Access (OWA) to gain access to your Calendar folder,
the date in the drop-down box below the calendar does not change if you use the
scroll bar to scroll to a different month. The two dates aren't synchronized.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use a browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later to
access the calendar information on the server, you see a daily or weekly view of
the calendar in the center pane, and two monthly views of the calendar in the
right pane. Below these monthly views is a drop-down box into which you can
enter a specific day, month, and year. When you click Go, the calendar view
above this box changes. However, the reverse is not true. That is, if you use
the scroll bars on the calendars themselves to move to a different date, the box
does not reflect the new date. The daily and weekly view of the calendar in the
middle pane, however, does change to reflect the new date.
