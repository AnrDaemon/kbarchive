TITLE   :XFOR: Connector for Lotus Notes Extracts Filter Rule Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you set up the filter rule in the [LME-NOTES-DXANOTES] section as follows:

   FILTER_X = X,EQ,[<formatted string>]

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes may extract the filter rule
incorrectly, and during directory synchronization (dirsync) the incorrect users
are synchronized to the Exchange Server directory if the [<formatted
string>] variable contains "," (without the quotation marks), for example:

   filter_person = CompanyName, EQ, Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and
   Tourism

The Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes synchronizes all of the entries to the
Exchange Server directory as if the user's CompanyName is "Ministry of Economic
Development" instead of "Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism."

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes uses "," (without the quotation marks) as
a delimiter when it parses the filter rule.

RESOLUTION
==========
