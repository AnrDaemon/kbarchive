TITLE   :XFOR: Notes Dirsync Doesn't Catch All Changes Using Mapping Rule
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you modify the Mapnotes.tbl file to send custom attributes in Exchange
Server to the Lotus Notes "children" field, the data may not be replicated over
if the user already exists in Notes. You must first delete the Exchange Server
user from the Notes Address Book and perform a full reload from Exchange Server
to Notes to successfully force the data to replicate over to Notes.

CAUSE
=====

During directory synchronization (dirsync) from Exchange Server to Notes, if a
new field appears in the mapping rules that were previously non-existent in
Notes, the Notes entry is not updated at all. This requires a full reload from
Exchange Server to Notes to successfully force the data to replicate over to
Notes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 4.
