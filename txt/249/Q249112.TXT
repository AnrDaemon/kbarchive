TITLE   :XFOR: Filter Rule Ignored by Directory Synchronization Process
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you set up a filter rule in the [LME-NOTES-DXANOTES] section of the
Exchconn.ini file, the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes ignores the
filter rule during directory synchronization (dirsync), and if a user's mail
domain is empty in the Notes server Address Book, the Exchange Connector for
Lotus Notes synchronizes the user to the Exchange Server directory.
Additionally, all of the resource documents are synchronized to the Exchange
Server directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is another INI parameter available, the ExportResources parameter, that
you can use in the [LME-NOTES-DXANOTES] section of the Exchconn.ini file. You
can set the ExportResources parameter to one of the following values, as
applicable:

 - 0 - The Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes does not export Resource entries
   from Notes at all.

 - 1 - The Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes exports Resource entries as before
   filter rules.

 - 2 - The Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes conditionally exports Resource
   Notes Address Book entries based on filter rules.

Before you apply this fix, or if the ExportResources parameter is set to a value
other than 2, filter rules (if any exist) are applied only to Notes Address Book
entries of the Person type. This parameter defaults to 1 if no setting is found.
