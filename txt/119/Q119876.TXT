======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows 95 and restart the system, it returns to an MS-DOS
prompt with the following error message:

   Incorrect MS-DOS version
   Enter the name of Command Interpreter (e.g., C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND.COM)

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if SETVER.EXE is being loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file and
has a setting indicating that COMMAND.COM should look for a version of MS-DOS
earlier than 7.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Boot the system with the Windows 95 Startup disk and do the following:

1. Change to the WINDOWS directory by typing the following:

   " cd\<Windows 95 directory name> " (without the quotation marks)

2. Rename the SETVER.EXE file by typing the following:

   " ren setver.exe setver.old " (without the quotation marks)

3. Remove the Windows 95 Startup disk from drive A, then shut down and restart
   the system. (Windows 95 loads at this point.)

4. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

5. Change to the Windows directory by typing the following:

   " cd\<Windows 95 directory name> " (without the quotation marks)

6. Rename the SETVER.EXE file again by typing the following:

   " ren setver.old setver.exe " (without the quotation marks)

7. Remove the COMMAND.COM entry by typing the following:

   " setver command.com /d " (without the quotation marks)

8. Restart the computer to make the SETVER changes take effect.

The above procedure allows SETVER to maintain compatibility with existing
MS-DOS-based applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Windows 95 is installed, the new SETVER.EXE assumes the settings of the
currently loaded SETVER.EXE in an effort to maintain compatibility with existing
MS-DOS-based applications.
