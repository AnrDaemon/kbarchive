TITLE   :X400: Err Msg: ERROR 3 (RTS): RTS Open Refused...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 may give the following error:

   ERROR 3 (RTS): RTS open refused (session limit exceeded)

CAUSE
=====

So that it can always leave one outgoing connection available, the X.400 gateway
version 3.2 can accommodate no more than three incoming connections in a given
time period. How the Gateway counts sessions during that time period explains
why this error is returned.

Consider this example sequence:

 - The gateway receives an incoming connection and holds it open for a long time
   (because it has several messages to receive).

 - While the first connection is open, the gateway receives a second incoming
   connection, which it accepts, processes and closes.

 - While the first connection is still open, the gateway receives a third
   incoming connection, which it accepts, processes and closes.

 - At this point the gateway calculates that the three-session limit has been
   reached within a specific interval, so when a fourth incoming connection
   request is received it is refused at the RTS level.

 - The gateway refuses subsequent incoming connection requests until the first
   connection is finished and closed.

This is hardcoded and cannot be changed.

RESOLUTION
==========

If this error becomes a problem, install another X.400 gateway on another
postoffice to spread the mail traffic.

If you have External running, try starting the gateway with the -md option
(mailer disable). With -md on, the gateway puts incoming mail in the postoffice,
but lets External finish the job by moving the mail to the recipient's mailbag.
This also saves memory on the X.400 Gateway.
