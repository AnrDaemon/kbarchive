-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you activate and use independent LU6.2 sessions through an IBM 3172
interconnect controller (configured as an external adapter) attached to VTAM
version 3.4.2, the LU6.2 session may hang or APPC allocation errors may occur.

SNA Server does not encounter these problems when communicating through an IBM
37x5 front end processor, to VTAM 3.4.2.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is solved when you apply IBM PTF #UY97878, which includes an update
to VTAM 3.4.2, when VTAM is implementing a boundary function.

Contact IBM to request this update.
