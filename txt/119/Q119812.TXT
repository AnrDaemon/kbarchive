TITLE   :BUG: SQLSRVR.DLL GP Fault on Vines When SQL Server Not Running
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG# ODBCSDK2: 10118 (1.02.3231)

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Windows version 3.1 or Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version
3.11 workstation is configured to use the Banyan Vines Network Library and
attempts to connect to a SQL Server machine on a Banyan Vines, but SQL Server is
not present or not running, SQLSRVR.DLL will cause a general protection fault
(GP fault).

The following configuration exhibits the above behavior:

 - Windows or Windows for Workgroups workstation with Banyan Vines redirector
   installed

 - SQL Server Win16 client Network Library (Net-Library) installed
   (DBMSVIN3.DLL). This is the Vines IP client-side Network Library.

 - A Banyan Vines server with a PC-based service created.

If ODBC is configured to use DBMSVIN3.DLL and an attempt is made to connect to a
PC-based service name that is currently not being used by SQL Server (for
example, no SQL server has registered with the PC-based service), then when the
ODBC client attempts to connect, a GP fault will occur in SQLSRVR.DLL with the
following message:

   Application Error
   <application name> caused a General Protection Fault in module
   SQLSRVR.DLL at 000C:098C.

WORKAROUND
==========

Make sure SQL Server is started before you attempt to connect with the ODBC SQL
Server driver and the Banyan Vines Network Library.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the ODBC SQL Server driver
version 1.02.3231. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
