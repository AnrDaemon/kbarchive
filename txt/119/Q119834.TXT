The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you install Windows for Workgroups over Microsoft LAN Manager, Setup
assumes you are upgrading your network operating system. It assumes that you
will not be using LAN Manager as your network, but will instead be using the
Microsoft Windows Network, or one of the other supported networks listed during
installation.

This article describes how to configure your workstation to use Windows for
Workgroups with LAN Manager as the only network operating system.


MORE INFORMATION
================

After you install Windows for Workgroups on top of LAN Manager and select "No
Windows support for networks," the following error message may appear when you
start Windows:

   Cannot find a device file that may be needed to run Windows.

   Make sure that the PATH line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file points to the directory
   that contains the file and that it exists on your hard disk. If the file does
   not exist, try running Setup to install it or remove any referenced to it
   from your SYSTEM.INI file. ee16.386 (This line varies, depending on your
   network card.)

The AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, and SYSTEM.INI files need to be modified to make
Windows for Workgroups function properly with LAN Manager.

Setup saved your old CONFIG.SYS file as CONFIG.OLD and your old AUTOEXEC.BAT file
as AUTOEXEC.OLD. Copy the lines specific to LAN Manager from the .OLD files and
combine them with the lines needed for Windows.

NOTE: If you had an existing AUTOEXEC.OLD or CONFIG.OLD, it will rename the files
CONFIG.001 and AUTOEXEC.001

Example AUTOEXEC.BAT for Windows for Workgroups with LAN Manager:

   @ECHO OFF
   PROMPT $p$g
   C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE
   PATH C:\WINDOWS;C:\DOS
   SET TEMP=C:\DOS
   C:\DOS\DOSKEY
   @REM ==== LANMAN 2.2 === DO NOT MODIFY BETWEEN THESE LINES ===
   LANMAN 2.2 ====
   SET PATH=C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG;%PATH%
   NET START WORKSTATION
   LOAD NETBEUI
   @REM ==== LANMAN 2.2 === DO NOT MODIFY BETWEEN THESE LINES ===
   LANMAN 2.2 ====
   WIN

Example CONFIG.SYS for Windows for Workgroups with LAN Manager:

(Notice that the line DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\IFSHLP.SYS has been removed that Windows
for Workgroups Setup usually inserts.)

   DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS
   DOS=HIGH
   FILES=30
   SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\ /p
   LASTDRIVE=Z
   STACKS=9,256
   DEVICE=C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTMAN\PROTMAN.DOS /i:C:\LANMAN.DOS
   DEVICE=C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\EXP16\EXP16.DOS

Delete the SYSTEM.INI in the Windows directory.

Modify the following lines:

   [boot]
   network.drv=LANMAN21.DRV   (Add LANMAN21.DRV)
   [386Enh]
   netcard=                   (You may need to remove a reference
                               to the network card, such as ee16.386.)
   transport=                 (You may need to remove a reference
                               to the protocol used, such as netbeui.386.)

The PROTOCOL.INI in the LANMAN.DOS directory should remain unchanged from a
regular LAN Manager workstation. The PROTOCOL.INI in the Windows directory
should contain only the following lines:

   [network.setup]
   version=0x3110

NOTE: If you plan on using WinPopup, make sure that you run WINPOPUP.EXE from the
LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG directory, not the one that may be in the Windows directory.
