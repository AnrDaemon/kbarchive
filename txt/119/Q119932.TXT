SUMMARY
=======

The Stop Velocity command (F4 on the keyboard) does not negate velocity relative
to the Reference object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Stop Velocity command stops all velocity relative to the closest physical
object, not the Reference object. The Stop Velocity command negates both radial
and tangential velocity. Stopping velocity while in orbit around an object
causes the spacecraft to fall out of orbit once tangential velocity is negated.
