SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft TCP/IP-32 stack uses various means to resolve a host name to an IP
address of a given host. Four mechanisms are used; Local Cached Information,
Hosts File, DNS Servers, and NetBIOS name resolution mechanisms. The default
resolution order for resolving a host name is Local Cached Information ->
Hosts File -> DNS Servers -> NetBt (NetBIOS over TCP/IP). NetBIOS over
TCP/IP name resolution can consist of local subnet broadcasts.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Under most circumstances, the default resolution order does not need to be
changed. However, if a change is necessary there are SYSTEM.INI parameters that
you can use to alter this default behavior. This is done by using the four
parameters: LocalPriority, HostsPriority, DnsPriority, and NetbtPriority. These
parameters are Specified in the [DNS] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. Valid
values can be between -32768 and 32767. The lower the value, the higher the
priority in the search order. If you specify any of these parameters in the
SYSTEM.INI, only those parameters specified will take effect, and none of the
other resolution methods will be used.

Example
-------

   [DNS]
   DnsPriority=1
   HostsPriority=2

Will search the configured DNS server first, followed by the local HOSTS file.
Local Cached Information and NetBIOS name resolution mechanisms would not be
used.
