TITLE   :BUG: Dbase or FoxPro: Fox Memo Select Stopped by Dbase
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

BUG# ODBCDBASE: 2129 (1.01.1928)

SYMPTOMS
========

The ODBC FoxPro driver is unable to fetch data from a Microsoft FoxPro table
that contains memo fields when it follows any CREATE TABLE statement executed
with the ODBC Dbase driver during a session operating on the same ODBC
environment handle allocated via SQLAllocEnv().

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the ODBC Desktop Database
Drivers version 1.01.1928. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is the ODBC Application Programming Interface (API) call sequence
that recreates this problem:

1. Connect to any ODBC Dbase datasource.

2. Create any form of Dbase table with the ODBC Dbase driver, Then free the
   statement handle used for this operation with SQLFreeStmt() but do not call
   SQLDisconnect().

3. Connect to an FoxPro ODBC datasource that provides access to a FoxPro table
   containing at least one memo field.

4. Attempt to execute a SQL SELECT query on the FoxPro table containing the memo
   field via SQLExecDirect() or attempt to prepare such a statement with
   SQLPrepare(); either way, the same problem will be created.

   The error message received is:

   [Microsoft][ODBC Single-Tier Driver][ODBC File Library]General Isam error.
   [Microsoft][ODBC Single-Tier Driver]Unable to open table: <table_name>.

To recreate this problem in MS Query:

1. Define a Dbase and a FoxPro ODBC datasource. You will need to create a Fox
   table ahead of time with your Fox datasource. It can have any number of
   columns but must contain one memo field.

   For example,

   create table fox1 (col1 memo)

2. In MS Query, from the File menu, select Execute SQL....

3. Click the Data Sources... button, and choose the Dbase datasource you have
   defined; click the Use button.

4. Create any form of Dbase table.

   For example:

   create table dbase1 (col1 char(30)).

   Then click the Execute button to execute the SQL statement. You should receive
   the message:

   Microsoft Query
   Executed SQL Statement successfully

5. Click the Data Sources... button and choose the FoxPro datasource you have
   defined, click the Use button.

6. Try to query on the Fox table with the SQL statement:

   select * from fox1,

   Click the Execute button to execute the SQL statement. You will get the
   message:

   Microsoft Query
   General ISAM error
   Unable to open table: fox1.
