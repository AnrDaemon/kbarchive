SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the criteria Windows 95 uses to determine whether or not
the task bar is hidden when a window becomes full screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The criteria are as follows:

 - The window is not a tool window.

 - The window is either not maximized, or it is maximized but doesn't have a
   caption.

 - The window is being sized such that it covers the entire work area.

 - The window is being sized such that one or more sides extend outside the work
   area.

If all four conditions are met, a state bit is set on that window. Then, whenever
a window with that state bit (or a window that is owned by a window with that
state bit) is activated, the task bar is hidden to allow the full-screen window
to be displayed.
