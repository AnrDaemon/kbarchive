KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for Windows 1994 edition 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1991 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Copy button to copy some of the longer movie reviews in
Cinemania or some of the longer topics in Bookshelf, only a portion of the
article may be copied to the Windows Clipboard.

RESOLUTION
==========

Instead of using the Copy button, press either CTRL+INSERT or CTRL+C to copy the
text. Both keystrokes copy the entire article to the Windows Clipboard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Copy button in Cinemania 1994 has a size limitation of 32K. A movie review,
such as "Gone With The Wind," can be larger than 32K, resulting in only part of
the review being copied when you choose the Copy button. Pressing CTRL+INSERT or
CTRL+C to copy the text will bypass the Cinemania Copy dialog box and copy
directly to the Windows Clipboard, capturing all of the text.
