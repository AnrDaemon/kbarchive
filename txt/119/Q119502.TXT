TITLE   :PRB: PView Sample Does Not Behave Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:1.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Build and run the PView sample included with Visual C++ 32-bit Edition. The box
labeled "Process, CPU Time, Privileged, and User" is not filled with the
expected strings. When you select the button titled "Memory Detail", the
following error dialog box displays:

   

    -------------------------------------------
   |              Memory Detail                |
   |-------------------------------------------|
   |                                           |
   |     Unable to retrieve memory detail.     |
   |                                           |
    -------------------------------------------

CAUSE
=====

The system performance monitor APIs return UNICODE strings. For the strings to
be displayed properly, UNICODE must be defined when you compile the sample
program.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the makefile compiler options to include /DUNICODE. This has been done
for you in Visual C++ version 2.0.
