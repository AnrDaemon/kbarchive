KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the T1 phase of automatic directory synchronization (Dir-Sync), or when
you manually run the requestor transmit process REQMAIN -T, the following error
messages may be displayed in the DIRSYNC.LOG file:

   Status Microsoft (R) Mail DirSync Requestor V3.2
   Warning[ 2] Error opening file: REQTRANS
   Fatal [ 40] Possible database corruption detected: REQTRANS
   Warning[152] Failure to transmit requestor updates
   Status Requestor process failed.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the REQTRANS.GLB transaction file is missing from the GLB
subdirectory on the postoffice.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can create a zero-byte REQTRANS.GLB file; however, this is not a complete
resolution to this problem. The resolution depends on whether the postoffice is
a Dir-Sync server postoffice or a requestor postoffice. For additional
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
