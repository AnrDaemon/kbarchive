-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.2, 3.21, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error occurs while SHARE.EXE is loaded:

   RSC: SFT NOT FOUND IN SFT LIST
   SHARE INTERNAL ERROR

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by programs that attempt to gain access to the System File
Tables (SFT), bypassing SHARE in the process. This problem occurs most often
with small peer-to-peer network operating systems.

SHARE.EXE requires continuous communication between the sharing information
tables that it maintains and the tables that the MS-DOS kernel maintains. SHARE
adds tables that link SFTs to paths and locks records for all open files. When
it searches the SFT and finds an entry for which it has no entry in its own
tables, the above error is generated and the system may stop responding (hang)
because SHARE is in an infinite loop.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you do not use Windows, you must choose between SHARE and the other program
that wants to have access to the SFT. No workaround is available.
