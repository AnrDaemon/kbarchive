TITLE   :ADT2: ADT Repair/Compact Documentation Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit "Advanced Topics" manual page 17 reads
as follows:

   Also be aware that if your application is secured, the user running the
   repair or compact operation must have Open Exclusive permission for the
   database.

This information is incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

The user running the repair operation does not need to have Open Exclusive
permission for the database. Any user validated by the database's SYSTEM.MDA
file can run the repair operation, even if that user has no explicit or implicit
permissions for the database. However, in order to compact the database, the
user must have Open/Run as well as Open Exclusive permissions for the database.
