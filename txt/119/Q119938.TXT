TITLE   :BUG: Menu Appears Behind Fox Icon on Menu Bar
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,2.5c,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A user-defined menu on the menu bar in FoxPro for Macintosh extends past the
right edge of the screen.

CAUSE
=====

The Macintosh System software treats both the menu bar and the desktop as the
visible portion of a larger area. In other words, the menu appears, but just not
in the visible portion of the viewing area.

RESOLUTION
==========

Shorten the names of the menu pads in order to bring all the options into the
viewable area of the monitor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a quick menu.

2. Add six new pads at the bottom of the definition with names such as
   Longoption1, Longoption2, and so on.

3. Click the Try It push button.

Note that the end of Longoption5 is behind the Fox icon and Longoption6 is not
even visible.

NOTE: This information does NOT apply to FoxPro for Windows or FoxPro for MS-DOS.
FoxPro for MS-DOS will allow you to scroll a long menu. FoxPro for Windows will
wrap the menu to a second line.
