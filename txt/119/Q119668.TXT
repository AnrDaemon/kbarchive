TITLE   :PRB: Linker Produces 2-MB Executables Under Windows NT 3.5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfile kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
 - The Microsoft Linker (LINK.EXE), version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

LINK.EXE included with Visual C++ for Windows NT, version 1.0, or FORTRAN
PowerStation for Windows NT, version 1.0 produces 2 MB executable files when
used on Windows NT version 3.5.

CAUSE
=====

The linker uses a memory-mapped file for the output file that is generated. The
initial file size is 2 MB and it is increased in 2-MB increments as the output
size grows. When the linker is finished, it truncates the file to its proper
size. It does this by truncating the file then unmapping it from memory, whereas
it makes more sense to do the reverse. (Windows NT version 3.1 produces the
expected output anyway, but Windows NT version 3.5 does not. Under Windows NT
version 3.5, the truncation is not successful and the output remains 2 MB for
even the simplest "Hello, World" program.)

RESOLUTION
==========

The next releases of these products will contain linkers that do not have this
problem. Until then, the Win32SDK version 3.5 CD contains a version of LINK.EXE
that corrects this problem in the \support\linker\32bit directory. Replace the
Visual C++ version 1.0 linker with the linker included on the Win32 SDK version
3.5 CD.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected with Windows NT, version 3.51, and FORTRAN
PowerStation, version 4.0.
