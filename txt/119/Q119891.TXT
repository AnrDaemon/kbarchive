SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT on a Gateway 2000 Nomad 425/450 DXL laptop computer,
the floppy disk drives are not accessible during the GUI portion of Setup. File
Manager displays the floppy disk icons, but they are inaccessible. Because of
this, you are unable to create an Emergency Repair Disk, but Windows NT still
installs correctly.

WORKAROUND
==========

For most Gateway laptop computers, the Advanced Power Management (APM) software
is utilized. In order to correct this problem, disable the use of the APM
software by running a utility called ADVOSOFF.EXE. This utility is recommended
to be run before you install Windows NT. This utility is available as
ADVOSOF.EXE on Gateway's BBS at (605) 232-2224, or call Gateway Technical
Support at (800) 846-2301.


The Nomad 425/450 DXL is manufactured by Gateway 2000, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
