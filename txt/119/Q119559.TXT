SUMMARY
=======

Check Names is one of the options available in the Microsoft Mail for Windows
Compose screen. This option allows you to check addresses against the address
lists by resolving the friendly names in the To and Cc lines. The Check Names
option cannot resolve mailbox names typed in the To or Cc field unless the
mailbox is part of the friendly name.

If the mailbox name cannot be made part of the friendly name, you can use one-off
addressing by entering a [MS:network/postoffice/mailbox] address in the To or Cc
field. Please note that "MS" should be used to prefix the 10/10/10 address even
though it is a PCM address.

If you are using one-off addressing in MAPI, set the Address field in the MAPI
Recipient structure to MS:network/postoffice/mailbox or set the Name field to
[MS:network/postoffice/mailbox].
