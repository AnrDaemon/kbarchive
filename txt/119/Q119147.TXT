Item ID   Filename       Description
-------   --------       -----------

S14857    SMILE.EXE      The SMILE.EXE file contains the code for the
                         article named "Building Component Software with
                         Visual C++ and the OLE Custom Control Developer's
                         Kit," by Eric Lang.

                         A key notion in component-based software develop-
                         ment is that a programmer using an existing
                         component does not need to understand its inner
                         workings--just the interfaces it exposes.  Eric
                         Lang walks you through the process of creating a
                         sample OLE Custom Control.
