======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you try to print a PowerPoint 4.0 presentation that contains embedded objects
created in CorelDRAW! versions 4.0 or 5.0 to the Genigraphics driver, you may
receive the following message:

   Sorry, there was an error (340) accessing the file.

This error will occur if you do not have CorelDRAW! installed on your computer.

This error will not occur if you print the presentation to an actual printer
(such as a LaserJet or dot-matrix printer.)

WORKAROUND
==========

You can get your presentation to print correctly by performing the following
steps:

1. Open the presentation in PowerPoint.

2. For each embedded CorelDRAW! object, do the following:
   a. Click the object once to select it.

   b. From the Draw menu, choose Ungroup. You will see the following warning:

   This is an imported object, not a group. Converting it to PowerPoint objects
   will permanently discard any embedded data or linking information it may
   contain. Convert to PowerPoint objects?

   c. Choose the OK button.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you print a presentation to the Genigraphics driver, you create a
compressed copy of that presentation. The compression process saves information
about the embedded objects in the presentation. If there is no information about
CorelDRAW! in your computer's registration database (REG.DAT), the Genigraphics
driver will not know how to compress CorelDRAW! objects.

Many OLE source applications include additional information in their objects.
This information may allow the Genigraphics driver to correctly compress those
objects even if the application that created them is not registered in REG.DAT.
CorelDRAW! objects lack this additional information.
