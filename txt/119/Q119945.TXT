SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to an Epson EPL-6000, TrueType characters may appear overlapped
with each other.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in Windows NT version
3.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Disabling the downloading of TrueType fonts, and thus printing documents as
graphics, results in the same problem. Some printers exhibiting the same
behavior have been resolved with the use of the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet
Plus driver.
