SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5, you can use the
Disk Administrator to create and delete partitions without rebooting the
computer. However, if you delete a partition and File Manager is running, even
after a screen refresh, the partition (drive letter) will still be displayed as
available in File Manager, even though it has actually been deleted.

If you select a drive (partition) in File Manager which has been deleted by the
Disk Administrator, one of the following errors will occur:

 - If Commit Changes Now has not been selected, an "Access Denied" error message
   appears if you try to access the drive. If you open the drive in File
   Manager, the following message appears:

      You do not have permission to access this directory.

 - If Commit Changes Now has been selected, the following error message appears
   if you try to access the drive:

   Error Selecting Drive The device is not ready.

If Commit Changes Now is not selected, even if File Manager is refreshed, it
continues to display the drive as if it is available, but access is always
denied. Once Commit Changes Now has completed, in order for File Manager to not
display the deleted partition, it must be restarted.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
