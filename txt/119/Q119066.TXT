 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

You can create a BOOTLOG.TXT file by typing "win /b" (without the quotation
marks) when you are troubleshooting problems starting Windows or Windows for
Workgroups. The /B switch creates the file in the Windows directory. You can
view BOOTLOG.TXT in a text editor, such as Windows Notepad. This file includes a
list of the basic Windows drivers as they are loaded. If there is a problem
loading a driver, a statement appears in the BOOTLOG.TXT file indicating which
driver could not load.

NOTE: This switch appends new information to the end of an existing BOOTLOG.TXT
file. Therefore, you may want to rename or delete any existing BOOTLOG.TXT file
in the Windows directory before using the /B switch.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In BOOTLOG.TXT, a line reporting a loading failure appears as follows

   LoadFail = <xxxxxxx.xxx> Failure code is <##>

where <xxxxxxx.xxx> is the name of the device that failed to load, and
<##> is the numeric failure code.

The following is a list of failure codes that may appear in the BOOTLOG.TXT file
and their corresponding descriptions:
