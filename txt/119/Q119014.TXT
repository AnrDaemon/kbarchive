TITLE   :PC DirSync: How to Recover from Missing REQTRANS.GLB File

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

REQTRANS.GLB is the directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) transaction file that
contains transactions created on that postoffice. Each transaction has a
transaction number (sync number) associated with it. The REQTRANS.GLB file
should never be deleted.

Deleting the REQTRANS.GLB file may prevent transactions from being processed. If
the file is accidentally deleted, re-creating a zero-byte REQTRANS.GLB file is
not sufficient to ensure that future transactions will be included in the
Dir-Sync process.

CAUSE
=====

After a zero-byte REQTRANS.GLB file is created, the new transactions will begin
at zero. If the requestor synchronization (ReqSync) number in the REQCONF.GLB
file is greater than zero, all transactions made at the postoffice will be
ignored until the transaction number is greater than the ReqSync number in the
REQCONF.GLB file.

RESOLUTION
==========

The correct recovery for this problem depends on whether the postoffice is a
requestor (Case 1) or the Dir-Sync server (Case 2).

Case 1: REQTRANS.GLB Has Been Deleted on a Requestor Postoffice
---------------------------------------------------------------

This situation can be resolved by creating a RESYNC file for that requestor
postoffice as follows:

1. On the server postoffice, run the Import program (IMPORT.EXE):

   import admin -ppassword -s -ddriveletter

2. Copy the RESYNC.GLB file from the Dir-Sync server's GLB directory to the
   requestor's GLB directory, and delete the file from the server.

3. On the requestor postoffice, run the LISTDS utility available in the
   "Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync)" document to reset the requestor's Dir-
   Sync configuration:

   listds admin -ppassword -ddrive -r -z

4. Run IMPORT to process the RESYNC file:

   import admin -ppassword -q -ddriveletter

Case 2: REQTRANS.GLB Has Been Deleted on the Dir-Sync Server
Postoffice
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

It is somewhat more work on the Administrator's part to recover from a missing
REQTRANS file on the Dir-Sync server. The steps above for resetting a requestor
will not work on the server, as IMPORT will not process the RESYNC file.
