======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Microsoft Windows Sound System, Microsoft Windows loads on
the first restart; however, if you quit Windows and then restart the system
again, Windows stops responding (hangs) at the logo screen.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Adaptec ASPI4DOS.SYS driver version 3.30 is loaded
on a system using the Adaptec 1542c bus-mastering SCSI hard disk controller.
This combination causes Windows to hang at the logo screen after the Windows
Sound System is installed and Windows is restarted a second time.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this behavior:

 - Remove the ASPI4DOS driver.

-or-

 - Remove the Windows Sound System drivers from the SYSTEM.INI file.
