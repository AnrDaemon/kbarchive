-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS/OfficeVision checks the LAN side for
mail to upload to the host, the text {future date} appears in the VMGATE.LOG log
file:

   16:56  Checking data files for BELLEVUE1 mail
   16:56     Queued to: CSIMS (JOHNFO)             865
   16:56          from: MSFT/MAIL30/MARKEEF        {future date}

The text {future date} means that the message was composed on a computer with a
system date later than that of the PROFS/Office Vision gateway.

This text does not appear if all machines on the mail network have the same
system date. Some LAN operating systems have facilities for changing these to
make them the same.

Versions of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS/OfficeVision later than 3.0 do
not show this text.
