TITLE   :Problems Accessing or Writing to the SYSTEM.INI File

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

 - Programs that modify the SYSTEM.INI file during installation stop responding
   (hang) or produce an error message similar to the following:

   Cannot read file <path> SYSTEM.INI

 - When you use MS-DOS Editor (EDIT.COM) in an MS-DOS session to edit the
   SYSTEM.INI file, the system hangs.

 - You are unable to modify the virtual-memory settings on your computer.

CAUSE
=====

Close-Up version 6.0 from Norton-Lambert assigns write protection to the
SYSTEM.INI file so that other applications cannot write to it.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only work around is to disable Close-Up with the following steps:

1. Open the AUTOEXEC.BAT file using a text editor, such as Windows Notepad.

2. Remark out (using the REM command) the statement that loads CHOST.EXE.

   Change

        <path>\chost.exe

   to:

         rem <path>\chost.exe

3. Save your changes and reboot your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Close-Up version 6.0 from Norton-Lambert is a modem host program that uses
"unobtrusive technology." This technology allows Close-Up to operate without
having its setup program make changes to the SYSTEM.INI file. After Close-Up is
running, it makes changes to the copy of the SYSTEM.INI file that is in memory.
Close-Up then locks the SYSTEM.INI file so that no other changes can be made.

Close-Up is manufactured by Norton-Lambert, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
