OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Creative Writer and/or Fine Artist may start in black and white on a color
Macintosh monitor.

CAUSE
=====

This will occur if the memory allocation to the application is less than 1536K.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setup checks for available memory on the Macintosh before it allocates a
specific amount of memory to Creative Writer or Fine Artist. It is likely that
when Setup was run, it perceived that there was not a lot of memory available on
the Macintosh, and allocated 1536K or less to the application.

The following are the default memory allocations on a Macintosh with adequate
available memory:

   Suggested: 4096K
   Minimum: 1024K
   Preferred: 4096K

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. From the Apple menu, choose About This Macintosh to see how much total memory
   exists on the computer, and to determine the largest unused block. (On System
   6.x Macintoshes, choose About the Finder.)

2. If there is enough memory available, allocate more memory to the application.
   Do not allocate more than the largest unused block.

   If there is not enough memory available, see the "Apple Macintosh User's
   Guide" for information about memory management on the Macintosh.

After following these steps, the application(s) should run in color.
