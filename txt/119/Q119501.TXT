TITLE   :PRB: Error CXX0017 or CXX0034 for typedef

KEYWORDS:kbDebug kbide

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Visual Workbench Integrated Debugger, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Declare a structure type and typedef a pointer to the structure type as
follows:

      struct MYSTRUCT {
         int x;
         int y;
      };

      typedef struct MYSTRUCT* PMYSTRUCT;

MYSTRUCT is a structure type and PMYSTRUCT is a typedef for a pointer to
MYSTRUCT. Declare and initialize the following variables:

      struct MYSTRUCT var1 = {0, 0};
      PMYSTRUCT var2 = &var1;

Putting a watch on "(PMYSTRUCT) &var2" produces the following error:

Visual C++ 1.0 and 4.0
----------------------

   CXX0017: Error: symbol 'PMYSTRUCT' not found

Visual C++ 2.x
--------------

   CXX0034: Error: types incompatable with operator

However, putting a watch on "(MYSTRUCT *) &var2" is successful.

CAUSE
=====

The typedef declares a new name for a type, but it does not define a new type.
The typecast attempted in the debugger requires the name of a defined type.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the defined type in the typecast, rather than using the name declared with
the typedef.
