The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows in 386 enhanced mode with 32-bit disk access enabled on a
Quantum LPS-540AT hard disk drive, the following error message occurs:

   The Microsoft Windows 32-bit disk driver (WDCTRL) validation failed at phase
   03, 3B.

CAUSE
=====

Quantum Corporation has confirmed that the LPS-540AT has 1120 cylinders, 59
sectors, and 16 heads, which makes this drive incompatible with the 32-bit disk
access device driver included with Windows and Windows for Workgroups (WDCTRL).
This does not affect 32-bit file access (VFAT) in Windows for Workgroups 3.11.


WORKAROUND
==========

Quantum Corporation recommends setting the BIOS parameters to the following:

   1024  cylinders
   16    heads
   63    sectors

NOTE: There is also a file available from the Quantum bulletin board service
(BBS) called IDE_DOS.EXE. This self-extracting compressed file contains an
MS-DOS-level utility that allows the drive to be formatted to 540 megabytes.
Also included is the file IDE_WIN.386, which is the Quantum replacement for
WDCTRL.

For more information about this procedure, contact Quantum Corporation Technical
Support.
