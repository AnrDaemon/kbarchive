======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you print from Fine Artist to an Apple Color StyleWriter Pro or Color
StyleWriter 2400, the output may not print as expected. Instead, outlines of
objects may print in the correct location on the page, but the objects
themselves will appear distorted and in portrait orientation on a landscape
oriented page.

RESOLUTION
==========

Turn off background printing, by following these steps:

1. From the Apple Menu, select the Chooser.

2. Select the Color StyleWriter Pro driver and printer, or select the Color
   StyleWriter 2400, depending on which printer and driver you are using.

3. Turn off Background Printing.

After following these steps, Fine Artist should print correctly.

NOTE: As of December 1995, the latest version of the Color StyleWriter 2400
Driver is version 2.1.1 and has corrected some printing problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following anomalies have been reported:

1. Output has a portrait image printed on a landscape oriented page.

2. Object outlines may print where no objects exist on-screen.

3. The printed image may appear stretched. For example, a circle may print as an
   oval.
