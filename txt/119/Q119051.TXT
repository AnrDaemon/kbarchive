======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Files created and saved in ASCII on an Apple Macintosh, and sent through the
Microsoft Mail Gateway to FAX, may wrap text lines back over themselves rather
than to another line.

ASCII documents created on an MS-DOS or Windows-based PC fax correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The Macintosh saves documents in ASCII format with only a carriage return; the
PC uses a carriage return plus a linefeed character.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the Macintosh ASCII document through a file format filter (such as MacSink)
that adds a linefeed character to the end of each line.
