======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you experience temporary hangs
or pauses. Typically, you enter several characters that do not appear on the
screen for several seconds, or the mouse cursor freezes for several seconds.

CAUSE
=====

Print Manager can cause this behavior when a remote printer is in an error
condition or the remote station is offline. Print Manager polls for the remote
printer approximately once per minute and continues to do so throughout the
Windows for Workgroups session.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are several ways to correct this condition:

 - Bring the remote workstation/print server online.

   -or-

 - Close Print Manager on the local machine. This disables print sharing on the
   local machine.

   -or-

 - Leave Print Manager running and disconnect from the remote printer that is
   not online.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
