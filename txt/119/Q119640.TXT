TITLE   :PC Adm: Incorrect Mailbags for SNADS and  PROFS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Mail administrator creates a SNADS DGN by choosing Gateway,
DGN, Create, a mailbag and key files are created for the DGN. This mailbag and
key file are never used because all SNADS gateway mail is queued up in the
mailbag for the gateway, regardless of the DGN to which the recipient belongs.

This problem does not cause mail to be lost.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Import utility with the -c option to autocreate SNADS DGNs. The Import
utility does not create mailbag and key files for each DGN.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of the Microsoft
Mail Administrator program. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The same behavior is exhibited when the Administrator adds a PROFS node through
the Admin program. When Import is used to autocreate PROFS nodes, it does not
create a mailbag for each PROFS node.
