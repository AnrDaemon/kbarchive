SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the limitations of keyboard-only usage in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use Windows 95 with a keyboard only (that is, no mouse is installed),
the following limitations apply:

 - In Windows Explorer, there is no method to move the vertical bar that divides
   the directory tree and file-listing window.

 - When you are viewing a window in Details mode, there is no option to change
   the size of the fields for the file Name, Type, Total Size, and Free Space
   listings.

 - You cannot use the right mouse button to click the small icon in the upper
   left corner of the title bar to display the context menu for a folder.

 - Unusually long filenames may be truncated on property sheet tabs. Depending
   on the design of the property sheet, you may not be able to access the long
   filename with the keyboard in order to view its entire name.

 - You cannot access the Media Player VCR control buttons without a mouse.
