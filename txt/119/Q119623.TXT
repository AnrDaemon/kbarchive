======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Remote Access Service, version 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Workgroup Connections version 1.0 and Remote Access Service
(RAS) version 1.1a, a modem connection using compression to a Sprintet X.25
Packet Assembly/Disassembly (PAD) may fail and the following error message may
appear:

   RAS Error 212

   Bad Modem or COM Port Failure

CAUSE
=====

After renaming MCOMP.INF to MODEM.INF and dialing to the X.25 PAD, the
connection drops upon PAD initialization and results in the error message above.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, use the MODEM.INF file that comes with RAS 1.1a and limit
the modem transfer rate to 9600 baud.
