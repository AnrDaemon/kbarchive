2. Install another Laserjet III printer driver on LPT2:.*

3. Install another Laserjet III printer driver on FILE:.

4. Now view the installed printers in any Windows application by selecting File
   Menu, then Printer Setup. The dialog box correctly displays three drivers,
   one for each port (LPT1:, LPT2:, and FILE).

5. Now view the installed printers while in FAXVIEW.EXE. The dialog box
   incorrectly displays one printer driver as follows:
