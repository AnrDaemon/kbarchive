PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.2,3.3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, versions 3.2, 3.3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS generates two IBM Notes to the UserID: one
contains the post office address list and the other contains a notice informing
the administrator that the post office address list has been downloaded.

The number of notes this generates for the UserID reader may become troublesome.

CAUSE
=====

By design.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS/OfficeVision Host Access component version
3.3 resolves this problem by making the second note optional.

To disable the second note, set the DIRECTORY_NOTE field to "NO" (without the
quotation marks) in the PWAINIT DATA file.

Additional query words: 3.20 3.30
