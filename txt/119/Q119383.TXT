MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the run-time version of Video for Windows is shipped with a variety of
products, finding reliable .AVI files for troubleshooting can be difficult. The
only .AVI files available for testing are those that shipped with the
application, and they may be embedded within the application. As a result, there
is no definitive way to troubleshoot problems.

WNDSURF1.AVI and SAMPLE.AVI ship with the Video for Windows retail product and
are known to work correctly. If you are having problems with the run- time
version of Video for Windows, download these two files and try to reproduce the
problem. If you have no problems running these files, the issue is unique to the
third-party video files or the application itself. For more information, contact
the third-party product manufacturer. If you can reproduce the problem with
SAMPLE.AVI or WNDSURF1.AVI, contact Microsoft Product Support Services at (425)
635-7172 for further assistance.
