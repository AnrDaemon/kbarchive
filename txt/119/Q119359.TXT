SUMMARY
=======

There are times when the MOVEUSER.EXE utility, included with version 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows, will not work properly. An example of this is when
one of the postoffices is on a DEC system.

The steps below outline the method for copying existing messages from the old
account (export), creating the new account, and then copying the existing
messages into the new account (import).

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Use the LISTUSER utility to get the user's hexadecimal ID (hex-id) from the
   old postoffice.

2. Copy the <hex-id>.MMF file to a floppy disk.

3. Set up the new account on the new postoffice. Set the password to match the
   old password.

4. Use the LISTUSER utility to get the new hex-id.

5. Rename the old <hex-id>.MMF file to the new <hex-id>.MMF.

6. Start Mail.
