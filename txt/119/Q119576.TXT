======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To turn off on-screen annotation and remove the annotation and hidden slide
buttons that appear during a slide show, do the following:

PowerPoint 7.0
--------------

1. Begin running the slide show

2. Immediately after the first slide appears, press CTL+L or click the right
   mouse button once to bring up the slide show options menu, click Pointer
   Options, and click Hide Always

This disables on-screen annotation for the slide show.

PowerPoint 4.x
--------------

1. Open Powerpnt.ini in a text editor such as Notepad. Powerpnt.ini is located
   in your Windows folder (directory).

2. Find the line in the [Microsoft PowerPoint] section of Powerpnt.ini that
   reads

   SlideShowToolBar=1

   and change it to:

   "SlideShowToolBar=0" (without the quotation marks)

3. Save Powerpnt.ini.

4. Restart PowerPoint. (The changes will go into effect after you restart
   PowerPoint.)

NOTE: This not only disables the buttons, it also makes it impossible to do
on-screen annotations or display hidden slides.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To turn off the annotation icon in the PowerPoint Viewer, when using the viewer
in a stand-alone installation, (that is, PowerPoint Viewer has been installed,
but not PowerPoint itself), you must create a Powerpnt.ini file, and enter the
following lines:

   "[Microsoft PowerPoint]
   SlideShowToolBar=0" (without the quotation marks)

This disables the annotation icon during a presentation run from the Viewer.


This information can be found in the PowerPoint Readme help file Ppreadme.hlp in
the topic Powerpnt.ini Options.
