SUMMARY
=======

The RETURN command provides a great deal of flexibility over program control.
RETURN terminates execution of a program, procedure, or function. Depending on
how RETURN is used, control is returned to the calling program, the
highest-level calling program, another program, or the Command window. The
sample code below illustrates the power of the RETURN command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Enter the following code in a program call RETTEST.PRG:


   PARAMETER x  && line 1

   ON ERROR DO myErr
   DO A
   WAIT WINDOW 'In master'   && line 5

   ON ERROR

   PROCEDURE A
   DO B
   WAIT WINDOW 'In A'   && line 11

   PROCEDURE B
   x=testing
   WAIT WINDOW 'In B'  && line 15

   PROCEDURE myErr
   DO CASE

   CASE x = 'master' RETURN TO MASTER CASE EMPTY(x) RETURN OTHERWISE RETURN TO
   &x

   ENDCASE


To demonstrate the capabilities of the RETURN command, try the following three
invocations of the above program from the Command window.

 - The following command returns to line 5 without executing lines 11 or 15: DO
   rettest WITH "master"

 - The following command returns to line 11 without executing line 15: DO
   rettest WITH "A"

 - The following command returns to line 15, the line of code immediately
   following the line that generated the error: DO rettest WITH ""

The program is so short that it may be helpful to use the Trace window and step
through the code. For additional information about using the Trace window, see
the "Debugging" chapter of the "Developer's Guide" and the "Program Menu"
chapter of the "User's Guide."
