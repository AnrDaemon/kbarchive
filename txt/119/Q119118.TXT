======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows 95 Setup program fails or displays the following error message:

   Setup error B1: Setup has detected an 80386 processor that is not compatible
   with this version of Windows. Before you can run this version of Windows, you
   need to upgrade your processor. Contact your computer manufacturer for more
   information.

CAUSE
=====

Intel 386 microprocessors dated before April 1987 are known as B1 stepping
chips. These chips are known to introduce random math errors when performing
32-bit operations, thus making them incompatible with Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

If your 386 chip was manufactured before April 1987 or has a label on it that
reads "For 16-bit operations only," contact your hardware manufacturer about a
microprocessor upgrade.
