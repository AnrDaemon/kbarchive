-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: MS-DOS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SCRCOMP.EXE script compiler program compiles an ASCII script file into an
encrypted script file for use with EXTERNAL.EXE and Remote client programs. When
you use the -Pscript option with SCRCOMP.EXE to test scripts as described on pg.
382 of the Microsoft Mail 3.2 "Administrator's Guide," the program always plays
the INITIALIZE script.

CAUSE
=====

The SCRCOMP.EXE program always sets the -P option to INITIALIZE, regardless of
the script specified.

RESOLUTION
==========

It is possible to work around the problem by swapping the INITIALIZE label with
the label of the script to be tested; CALL, ANSWER, RESET, or DISCONNECT, and
execute the SCRCOMP.EXE program with the -P option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation. We are researching this problem. and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
