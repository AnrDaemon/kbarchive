TITLE   :PC Win: SMTP Address Generates a Non-Delivery Report
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Windows client receives a message from the SMTP gateway that contains a
comma in the comment field of the address in the To: or Cc: field, the address
is delimited by the comma and a Non-Delivery report is generated. No mail is
misdirected or lost.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows client incorrectly uses the comma to delimit the address on the To:
or Cc: field. For example

   To:<Administrator (comment,comment)>

becomes two addresses resulting in

   To: Admin; Comment)>;

The portion of the address following the comma is treated as a bad address and a
Non-Delivery report is generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

The sender should edit the address in the To: or Cc: field and exclude commas in
addresses.

The address appears correctly in the MS-DOS client until the Mail for Windows
client accesses the message. To read the message, use the MS-DOS client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
