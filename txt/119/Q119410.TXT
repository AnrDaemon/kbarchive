KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the Mail administrator follows the instructions available in SETUPD.EXE on
the Microsoft Software Library (MSL) to install and run version 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for Windows from the network, the MSSFS.DLL and TRNSCHED.DLL files are
still copied to each workstation.

These two DLLs need to be copied locally on each workstation to enable the Mail
System Selector (MAILDRV.EXE) to switch transports. The System Selector looks
for these two DLLs in the Windows SYSTEM directory when it needs to deactivate
the LAN driver and activate the Remote driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Mail System Selector is a program delivered with version 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail Remote. The Mail System Selector allows the user to switch to a different
mail service.

NOTE: The following is additional information on the DLLs:

   MSSFS.DLL Microsoft Shared File System PC Mail transport
   TRNSCHED.DLL Microsoft Schedule+ transactions
