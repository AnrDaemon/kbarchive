TITLE   :MCI: Invalid Address Causes Delivery Failure to All Users
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::2.1b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MCI, version 2.1b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a message is sent from Microsoft Mail to one or more invalid MCI Mail users
addressed in the TO: line, the message does not reach any of its intended
recipients, even ones with valid addresses. Instead, it bounces back from MCI
with this error message:

   Mail Failure...At least one problem with the envelope.

CAUSE
=====

The cause of this problem is not yet known. The expected results in such an
instance are that valid MCI Mail recipients receive the mail message, and the
sender is notified of the invalid addresses.

WORKAROUND
==========

No workaround is available at this time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Mail Gateway to
MCI, version 2.1b. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
