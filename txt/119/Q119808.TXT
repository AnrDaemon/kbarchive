TITLE   :Transverse & Extra Paper Sizes Not Available in Common Dialogs

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a PostScript printer that supports transverse and extra paper
sizes (such as the Agfa 9000 series PS), applications that use common dialog
boxes (such as the applications that ship within Windows and Windows for
Workgroups) do not list all the paper sizes supported by the printer. When you
choose Print Setup from the File menu of one of these applications, these paper
sizes do not appear; however, if you choose the Printers icon in Control Panel
and choose the Setup button, they do appear.

In Write, for example, the following paper sizes do not appear in the Print Setup
dialog box:

   Letter Transverse 11 x 8.5 in
   A4 Transverse 297 x 210 mm
   A5 Transverse 148 x 210 mm
   B5 Transverse 182 x 257 mm
   Letter Extra 9.5 x 12 in
   A4 Extra 236 x 322 mm
   Legal Extra 9.5 x 15 in
   Tabloid Extra 11.69 x 18 in
   Letter Extra Transverse 12 x 9.5 in

CAUSE
=====

These paper sizes are not displayed because of a problem with the Print Setup
common dialog box supplied with Windows 3.1 (and later versions) and the
PostScript printer driver PSCRIPT.DRV.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, open Control Panel, choose the Printers icon, make
the desired printer the default, press the Setup button, and specify the desired
paper size in the Paper Size list. This allows the application to print the
desired paper size.

NOTES:

 - The Paper Size line of the Print Setup dialog box of the application is blank
   because the Print Setup common dialog box does not list transverse and extra
   paper sizes.

 - Note that changing the Paper Size in the Print Setup dialog box of an
   application overrides the settings in the Setup dialog box of Control Panel.
