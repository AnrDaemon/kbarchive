SUMMARY
=======

If your spacecraft is outside of our solar system, you may see the text "None
Available in this situation" in the selection boxes for Asteroids, Planets,
Moons, Spacecraft, Space Stations, and Comets.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For selections to appear in these menus, your spacecraft must be placed near a
star system that contains the type of objects you want to select. For example,
if you want to select a space station, you must be positioned in the same star
system as that space station.

To return to our solar system, click Set Location from the Location menu and
click Our Sun from the list of Stars.
