SUMMARY
=======

When you are using Novell NetWare version 4.x and Windows, you can have more
than three printer ports available through Novell.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Novell Workstation Shell version 3.x (NETX) is limited to three Novell printer
redirections. With Novell DOS Requester (VLM), you can have up to nine printer
redirections. To achieve this:

1. Edit the current NET.CFG file and add the following line in the NetWare DOS
   Requester section

   Network Printers =<x>

   where x equals the number of redirections.

2. Edit the WIN.INI file and add LPT<x>:= (where <x> represents the
   port number) for each LPT port that you want to add. For example:

         LPT4:=
         LPT5:=
         LPT6:=
         LPT7:=
         LPT8:=
         LPT9:=

Novell NetWare is manufactured by Novell, Inc., a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
