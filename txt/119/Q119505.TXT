SUMMARY
=======

Although the Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) does not specify any
compatible docking stations for laptop or notebook computers, these devices
should work correctly with Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because a docking station is really just an extension of the system bus, any
system that is listed on the Windows NT HCL should function properly under
Windows NT with the docking station attached.

Please note, however, that adapters installed in a docking station should be
selected from among those listed in the HCL as compatible, just as with any
other system.

Additionally, if Windows NT is configured with optional adapters installed in a
docking station, then is later used away from the docking station, error
messages may be displayed at startup when Windows NT is unable to locate those
devices. Aside from these messages, normal operation should be unaffected.
