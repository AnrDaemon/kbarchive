TITLE   :FAX: FAXLOGO3.PCX Opens in ZOOM IN Mode Within PaintBrush
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0,3.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open FAXLOGO3.PCX (the Microsoft Mail Gateway to FAX default logo file)
within PaintBrush, any modifications you make while editing it are compressed on
the cover sheet of the outgoing fax.

CAUSE
=====

Because of how the file has been saved to the original install disks, the
drawing area is displayed in the Zoom In mode when you open the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To preserve any modifications you make in PaintBrush, select Zoom Out mode after
you open the file and before you make any changes to it. This shrinks the
drawing to fit the drawing area.

You can use other graphics programs to create or modify the PCX formatted logo as
long as they save in "black and white" PCX format. See the "Microsoft Mail
Gateway to FAX Administrator's Guide" for more details on the "black and white"
PCX format.
