SUMMARY
=======

Windows 95 is designed to function with advanced power management (APM) enabled
computers. Some computers conform to the APM specification 1.0; others use APM
1.1. Although Windows 95 works with both specifications, there are advantages to
using APM 1.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95's functionality improves with APM 1.1 because version 1.1 is designed
to give the operating system more control over power management than APM 1.0
permitted. For example:

 - If a computer is using APM 1.1, the operating system can force the BIOS to
   wait (essentially indefinitely) until it has prepared the running programs
   and drivers for suspend mode.

 - If a computer is using APM 1.1, the operating system can reject the request
   for suspend mode.

The operating system does not have this control in APM 1.0. These features help
stabilize the suspend function in a Windows 95/APM 1.1 environment.

Enhancements in APM 1.1 allow applications and system components to become more
actively involved in the suspend/resume process. Windows 95 also queries the APM
BIOS more thoroughly than previous versions of Windows by obtaining more
accurate information regarding the power state and the remaining battery life.
This is possible because APM 1.1 provides more accurate reporting of the
remaining battery power and documents the specification more legibly than APM
1.0, helping to make power management more reliable.
