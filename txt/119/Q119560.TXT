SUMMARY
=======

In version 3.0b of the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks MS-DOS client, you can
type an external postoffice or gateway address directly in the To or Cc line,
although some directory traversing is required. This is called one- off
addressing. You can use one-off addressing by traversing the address lists and
pressing the INSERT key when the address list you require is displayed.

For example, to use one-off addressing for a PROFS address perform the following
steps:

1. Select Compose, To.

2. Press the LEFT ARROW key to display the available address lists.

3. Choose PROFS, then choose the Node. The available addresses will be
   displayed.

   You can now press the INSERT key and type in the VM ID to which you want to
   send mail.

To use one-off addressing for an external postoffice address, perform the
following steps:

1. Select Compose, To.

2. Press the LEFT ARROW key to display the available address lists.

3. Choose Postoffice Network List, then choose the network and postoffice. The
   available addresses will be displayed.

   You can now press the INSERT key and type in the mailbox to which you want to
   send mail.
