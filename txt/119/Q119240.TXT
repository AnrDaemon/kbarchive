TITLE   :PC DirSync: Err Msg: Error 46 No Fullname
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error is recorded in the DIRSYNC.LOG file during the execution of
the Import program:

   Error [ 46] No Fullname

CAUSE
=====

The alias name file (for example, X400.NME) is empty (or zero bytes) and the
gateway address file (for example, X400.GLB) contains addressing information
(larger than 4 bytes). The directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) server on which
the extraction occurs attempts to create an invalid entry in the import file it
created on the Dir-Sync server. The error will appear on the requestor when the
import is performed to add the new addresses to the gateway list. The import
file is created as part of a request from a requestor for a full import or in a
RESYNC.GLB file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restore the address and alias files to a normal condition. This would include
reloading the gateway addresses or reducing the addressing file to its four byte
original state.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following error may also be recorded in the DIRSYNC.LOG:

   Warning 43 Gateway alias has no physical address.

This error may appear if the addressing files for the gateway on the server are
not complete.

Additional query words: 3.20 dirsync dirsynch
