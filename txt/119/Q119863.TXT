SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT backup program, NTBACKUP.EXE, with a supported tape
unit connected to the same SCSI chain as the hard disk of a Quantum ProDrive
1080s, the following error message may appear:

   Fatal error on drive 1.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the hardware termination on the hard disk of the
Quantum ProDrive 1080s is not properly disabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

According to the Quantum hard disk documentation, the Quantum ProDrive 1080s has
a TE jumper that needs to be removed in order to disable the termination.
However, in order to properly disable the termination, all termination jumpers
(not just the TE jumper) need to be removed.
