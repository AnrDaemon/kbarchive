The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5x, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for UNIX, version 2.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The APPEND FROM ARRAY command should create one record in the currently selected
database for each row in an array. Occasionally, only a single record will be
created with the data from the first element of the array.

CAUSE
=====

The array has been created as a one-dimensional array, as shown in the following
example:

      DIMENSION myarray(40)

RESOLUTION
==========

The array must be created as a two-dimensional array, as shown in the following
example:

      DIMENSION myarray(40,1)

The ",1" causes the array to be created as 40 rows by 1 column. The APPEND FROM
ARRAY command will now function as expected.
