SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how you can run the MS-DOS 6.22 DoubleSpace conversion
setup program from a drive other than a floppy disk drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a floppy disk drive is not present on the system and you want to run the
DoubleSpace-to-DriveSpace conversion setup program, you can run it from the hard
disk drive or any other drive. To do so, the files included with the conversion
program must be located in the root directory of the drive you want to run Setup
from. If the files are not located in the root directory of the drive, you
receive the following message

   An error occurred while reading <drive>:\DRVSPACE.MR1

where <drive> is the drive from which you ran SETUP.EXE.

The following files need to be in the root directory:

   DBLCDESC TXT   2,460   05-31-94   6:22a
   DRVSPACE MR1     512   05-31-94   6:22a
