SYMPTOMS
========

During the playback of a metafile or printing, the GDI heap fills up and it is
not possible to create additional GDI objects.

CAUSE
=====

This filling of the GDI heap can be caused by a metafile that does not contain
any DELETEOBJECT metafile records. The GDI objects created during the metafile
playback never get deleted, which fills up the GDI heap. An application that
prints without using banding in Windows version 3.1 causes a metafile to be
created on behalf of the application. The problem listed above then occurs.

The DELETEOBJECT metafile record is a new feature developed for Windows version
3.1. This record is used to record DeleteObject() calls into the metafile, so
that the specified GDI object is deleted during playback of the metafile. If you
call DeleteObject() on an object that is currently selected into a metafile
Device Context (DC), a DELETEOBJECT record will not be recorded into the
metafile. The documentation for DeleteObject() states that the object must not
be selected into a DC.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure to deselect the object in your metafile DC before calling
DeleteObject() to delete the object.

For additional information about calling DeleteObject() for a metafile object,
please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q68296 Windows 3.x Metafiles Support DeleteObject()

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
