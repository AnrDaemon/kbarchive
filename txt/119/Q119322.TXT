SUMMARY
=======

When dragging the CD icon to the Trash, or choosing Eject Disk from the Special
Menu, you may receive an error message similar to this:

   The disk <Product Name> cannot be removed, because it is shared.

   Example: The Disk Encarta cannot be removed, because it is shared.

This message appears if File Sharing is enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow one of these steps:

1. The problem with ejecting CD-ROMs has been corrected with File Sharing 7.5.1,
   which ships with Apple Macintosh System 7.5 Update 1.0.

   -or-

2. Choose Sharing Setup from Control Panels and turn off File Sharing. After
   turning off File Sharing, you should be able to drag the CD icon to the
   Trash.

   -or-

3. Try UnMountIt, an Apple utility that allows you to eject a CD without
   shutting down the system or manually turning off File Sharing. It turns off
   File Sharing, ejects the CD, and turns File Sharing back on again. It is
   available from Apple by calling (800) SOS-APPL, or if you are an AppleLink
   subscriber, it's also available to download from AppleLink.
