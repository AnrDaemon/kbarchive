 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In versions 3.0 and later of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks version, the
definition of system groups, the members who make up the group, is propagated to
other Mail servers.

NOTE: System groups are groups defined by the Network Manager versus Personal
Groups created by individual users.

If a group definition contains other groups, all groups are expanded before group
information is propagated to other Mail servers. This is a change from Microsoft
Mail version 2.0, which only propagated the name of the group. This meant that
any mail sent to a group had to be forwarded to the Mail server where the group
was defined.


Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
