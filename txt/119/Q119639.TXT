SUMMARY
=======

Page 17 of the Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows "User's Guide" lists the
procedure to start Mail Remote automatically by including the mailbox name and
password in the Program Item Properties command line. For example:

   c:\msmail\msmail.exe johndoe password

If you start Mail Remote with the AT&T Mail driver selected as the active
transport, the above command does not work as expected. The mailbox information
is passed on, but you are still prompted for the password even though it is
supplied on the command line.
