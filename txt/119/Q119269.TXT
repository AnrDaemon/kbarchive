SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a fax through a shared network fax (that is, a fax modem not on
the local machine) by printing to the Microsoft At Work PC Fax printer driver
from within an application, the fax is not sent. No error message is displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you do not have a MAPI application running on both
machines.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, start a MAPI application (for example, Microsoft Mail
or Schedule Plus) on each workstation.
