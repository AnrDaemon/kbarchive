TITLE   :PC Win: How the Inbox Received Time Stamp Is Set
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Mail for Windows, the Inbox contains the message header
with the time the message was received. This Inbox time stamp is set by the
delivery agent. If the message is from another user on the same postoffice, the
time is stamped by the sending client. If the message is from an external
postoffice or a downstream postoffice, the time is stamped by the External Mail
program (EXTERNAL.EXE). If the message is from a gateway directly serving the
postoffice, the time is stamped by the gateway.

The External Mail program sometimes does not time stamp messages transferred
asynchronously or through an X.25 connection. Therefore, the received time stamp
reflects the time when the message was composed and not the time it was received
by EXTERNAL.EXE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This problem was corrected in version 3.2a
(which includes EXTERNAL.EXE version 3.2.9).
