TITLE   :PC Forms: Cross-Platform E-Forms Not Supported
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer does not include any cross-platform
support for Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks. Although Microsoft Mail for
AppleTalk Networks includes an electronic form (E-form) solution, it cannot be
configured to interface with E-forms created using the Electronic Forms
Designer.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft E-Forms Designer uses Visual Basic as its design environment.

On the Macintosh platform, Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks includes a
HyperCard-based Forms Designer. While the two E-forms packages allow
administrators to create E-form solutions on both the Macintosh and Windows
platforms, they cannot be designed to interact cross-platform.

STATUS
======

This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
release.
