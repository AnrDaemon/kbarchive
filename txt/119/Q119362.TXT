TITLE   :PC Adm: Remote User Init-Disk Hangs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While creating a remote user's data disk using the Mail Administrator program
(ADMIN.EXE) for versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the
process may hang during the Init-Disk stage.

CAUSE
=====

One possible cause of this problem is a corrupt MODEM.GLB file. The MODEM.GLB
file is used by the Mail Administrator program to provide information for the
creation of the data disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, rename the current MODEM.GLB file located in the GLB
subdirectory of the postoffice database to MODEM.BAK. Then, within the Mail
Administrator program, perform a Remote, Regenerate process. This will re-create
a new MODEM.GLB file. Performing a Remote, Init-Disk should now work without
hanging the process.
