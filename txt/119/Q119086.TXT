======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your machine stops responding (hangs) at the logo screen when you start Windows
for Workgroups 3.11 with Novell NetWare NETX and an ArcNet card.


NOTE: If you are using the Novell VLM redirector, the machine does not hang,
instead, File Manager reports Novell server drives do not exist when you select
them.

CAUSE
=====

Most ArcNet cards come with the factory defaults settings of IRQ 2 and I/O Base
02E0. IRQ 2 is reserved for the cascading BIOS, and 02E0 can cause a conflict
with an installed COM 2 port. This problem can occur with any hardware conflict
and is not limited to the default settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, reconfigure the ArcNet card for a different interrupt
and a different port address.
