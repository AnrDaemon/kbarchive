The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a stripe set with parity on a Windows NT Advanced Server version
3.1 using an Adaptec 1542C or Adaptec 1542CF ISA SCSI controller, data
corruption may occur, and the following message may appear in the Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 11 Source: Aha154x Type: Error
   Description: The driver detected a controller error on \Device\ScsiPort0.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs mainly due to the SCSI controller producing time-outs during
heavy I/O transfers. This problem may also be caused by poor cabling or improper
termination.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Advanced Server
version 3.1. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. For information on
obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Adaptec 1542C and 1542CF SCSI controllers process slower as you add devices
to the card, congesting traffic on the bus. With the adapter load generated by
multiple devices, the combination of the poll rate waiting for the adapter to
become idle and the total time-out period allowed don't give the adapter time
for the last command to clear.
