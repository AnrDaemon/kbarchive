The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, you can create
custom commands. There is an undocumented extension to the syntax for defining
custom commands in the MSMAIL.INI file.

The custom command can specify that a particular ordinal in a dynamic-link
library (DLL) should be called by placing a comma and a number after the DLL
name in the custom command entry.

For example, the following entry specifies that ordinal 24 in the MSRMTUI.DLL
file should be used:

   MSMRT:ConnectNow=3.0;view;Connect &Now...; -1; msrmtui.dll,24; ;
   *0000000000000000;Connect to Postoffice;MSRMT.HLP;6506

MORE INFORMATION
================

Chapter 1 of the Microsoft Mail "Technical Reference" describes how to create
custom commands. According to the "Technical Reference," a custom command DLL
must have the following function defined:

   long FAR PASCAL Command (PARAMBLK FAR * lpParamblk

For more information about the PARAMBLK type, see the "Technical Reference."

The "Technical Reference" specifies that this function must be exported with the
ordinal number 1. Using the undocumented extension to the MSMAIL.INI syntax, the
function can be exported with another ordinal number. In this case, the entry in
the MSMAIL.INI file should refer to this new ordinal number.


Additional query words: 3.00 3.00b 3.20
