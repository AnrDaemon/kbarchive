The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Schedule service and then enter an AT command to instruct the
COPY command to run at a specified time, the COPY command does not run at the
specified time and the following message appears in Event Log:

   Event ID: 7901
   Source: Schedule
   Type: Error
   Category: none

   The system cannot find the file specified.

NOTE: These symptoms occur when you attempt to use any internal command with an
AT command.

WORKAROUND
==========

To run any internal command from the AT command use "CMD /C" syntax. For
example:

   AT 10:00 CMD /C COPY C:\*.* C:\TEMP

Under Windows NT version 3.1, the "CMD / C" switch was not necessary. However,
this functionality has changed for Windows NT version 3.5 to correct problems
with passing arguments to commands.

NOTE: XCOPY, CHKDSK, do not require the "CMD /C" command because they are not
internal commands.
