PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you had a previous installation of Microsoft TCP/IP-32 on Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11, one of the following error messages may appear when you
attempt to re-install Microsoft TCP/IP-32:

   Setup Error 108: Could not create or open the PROTOCOL.INI file.

-or-

   Setup Error 110: Could not find or open WIN.INI.

CAUSE
=====

When you install TCP/IP-32, the OEMSETUP.INF file is copied to the SYSTEM
directory and renamed OEMx.INF (where x is a number). The OEMx.INF file is then
used by Setup to perform the necessary transactions for installation. The above
error messages may appear due to earlier (beta) versions of the OEMx.INF file
being in the SYSTEM directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

1. Remove any previous versions of Microsoft TCP/IP-32.

2. Quit Network Setup and restart your system.

3. Rename any OEMx.INF (where x is a number) files that are in your
   WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

4. Start Network Setup again and install Microsoft TCP/IP-32, following the
   installation instructions in the manual.
