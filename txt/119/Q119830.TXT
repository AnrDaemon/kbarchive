TITLE   :Err Msg: Unable to Start DDE Communications with Program Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty msnets win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft PowerPoint version 4.0 or Microsoft Publisher version
2.0 while running Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.0 as the shell, you
receive the following error message:

   Unable to Start DDE communications with Program Manager

   Abort, Retry, Ignore

Choosing Ignore allows the installation to continue; however, the above error
message is received once more in the final portion of the installation. Pressing
Ignore again allows you to continue and complete the installation.

NOTE: Microsoft does not support using any shell other than Windows Explorer as
the primary Windows 95 shell. If you want to use a third-party shell with
Windows 95, Microsoft recommends adding it to the Startup folder.

CAUSE
=====

Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.0 does not handle shell dynamic data
exchange (DDE). When this fails, Microsoft PowerPoint 4.0 and Microsoft
Publisher 2.0 attempt to perform the DDE operation through Program Manager
(PROGMAN.EXE). For compatibility reasons, PROGMAN.EXE does not perform DDE
unless it is the active shell in Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this error, use EXPLORER.EXE as the shell for Windows 95 and load
Norton Desktop for Windows as an application. Then install Microsoft PowerPoint
version 4.0 or Microsoft Publisher 2.0.

To deactivate Norton Desktop as the shell, replace "shell=ndw.exe" with
"shell=explorer.exe" in the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file using the
following steps:

1. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

2. Type "system.ini" (without the quotation marks) in the Open box and click OK.

3. Replace "shell=ndw.exe" with "shell=explorer.exe" in the [boot] section.

4. Save and close the file.
