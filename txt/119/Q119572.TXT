TITLE   :WFWG: Printer Alerts Not Received with WinPopUp
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Printer alerts from Print Manager that are displayed through WinPopUp do not
appear on some machines; however, WinPopUp messages generated by other users are
properly received and displayed.

CAUSE
=====

The following three situations prevent WinPopUp from displaying printer alerts:

 - The presence of a SendPrintMessages=No entry in the [Network] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file on the print server.

   -or-

 - A computer name with more than 15 characters.

   -or-

 - A computer name or user logon name that contains a space (including a

trailing space).

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem, use the appropriate method below:

 - Remove the SendPrintMessages=No entry in the [Network] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file. The presence of this entry prevents printer alerts on any
   computer connected to the shared printer.

   -or-

 - Limit computer names to fewer than 15 characters. Windows for Workgroups has
   a NetBIOS-imposed limitation of 15 characters for server (computer) names and
   12 characters for share names.

   -or-

 - Do not use spaces in computer names. When a space is included in a computer
   name, all characters after the space are truncated for a printer alert. This
   means that the alert is either not sent to the proper machine, or it is sent
   to a nonexistent machine. If the truncated computer name does not exist on
   the network, no error message is generated.

   NOTE: Although you can use spaces in server and share names in Windows for
   Workgroups, it is not recommended. Spaces can prevent other computers from
   being recognized by Windows NT version 3.1 machines. Also, if a Windows for
   Workgroups post office server name or share name contains any spaces, Windows
   for Workgroups Mail clients cannot connect to the post office. If you want to
   include white space, an underscore character can be used instead. For
   example, instead of \\COMPUTER NAME, use \\COMPUTER_NAME.
