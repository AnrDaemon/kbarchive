======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When compiling code that uses #pragma pack() to pop an ID that has not been
pushed after successfully popping an ID that was pushed, the compilers listed
above will generate:

   fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR

In addition, this error will be followed by a message similar to

   (compiler file 'msc1.cpp', line 902)
   Please choose the Technical Support command on the Visual C++ Help menu, or
   open the Technical Support help file for more information

NOTE: In Microsoft Visual Studio .NET, you receive a C4160 warning instead of the
error message, so you can compile and run the program.

RESOLUTION
==========

Pop only IDs that have been previously pushed onto the compiler's internal
stack.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code demonstrates the bug:

Sample Code
-----------

   /* packfail.c

   Compile options needed: none
   */ 

   #pragma pack(push, a)
   #pragma pack(push, b, 4)
   #pragma pack(pop, b)
   #pragma pack(pop, value)
