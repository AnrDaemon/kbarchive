======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While creating a data disk for a remote user, a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
administrator may experience notice messages during different operations. For
example, the following message may appear during an Init- Disk operation:

   Notice 101
   Error file not accessible
   Check server connection
   Press Enter to continue

You may also receive a Notice 107 message. For additional information about this
message, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q118358 PC DB: Err Msg: Notice 107, File Is Inaccessible

CAUSE
=====

The Notice 101 error occurs when the ADMIN.EXE program is unable to access the
following four error message files, which are usually located in the GLB
subdirectory of the postoffice database:

   ENGMAI.GLB
   ENGMON.GLB
   ERRORADM.GLB
   ERRORDYN.GLB

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the GLB subdirectory for the existence of these files. If they do not
exist, the administrator can replace these files in one of the following two
ways:

1. Find another postoffice in the Mail system that contains these files and copy
   them from that postoffice to the problem postoffice's GLB subdirectory.

2. Using the complete set of Setup disks for version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
   PC Networks, install a complete temporary postoffice on a local workstation
   hard drive. Be careful to install the complete client software (for both
   MS-DOS and Windows) as well. The temporary postoffice will contain the
   missing files in the GLB subdirectory. Copy the files to the problem
   postoffice's GLB subdirectory.
