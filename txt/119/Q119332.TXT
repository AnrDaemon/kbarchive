The documentation for the 32-bit LIB utility says that the /LIST option can
be used to determine the contents on an existing library. The output for an
object library is a list of the names of the object modules used to build
the library. However, the output for an import library is the name of the
module-definition (.DEF) file or the DLL, repeated for each imported
symbol.

For example, run the following command to view the contents of the import
library GDI32.LIB:

   lib /list gdi32.lib

 
The output is as follows:

LIB 1.0
-------

   gdi32.def
   gdi32.def
   gdi32.def
   ...
   gdi32.def
   gdi32.def

LIB 2.5x
--------

   gdi32.dll
   gdi32.dll
   gdi32.dll
   ...
   gdi32.dll
   gdi32.dll

This is the format of an import library: all of its modules have the same
name. Microsoft LINK relies on this information during linking.
