TITLE   :FFAPI: ERRMSG: Mail Received for Unknown Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:2.1,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit: FFAPI for Gateways and Applications, versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Microsoft Mail File Format API programs to "put" a message into a
Microsoft Mail postoffice sent to a group alias may result in this error,
recorded in the m:\log\system.log file:

   User mail received addressed to the following unknown addresses:
   <address>

CAUSE
=====

When mailing to a group, the group address must be used, not the alias name.

Both the Admin program and the mail clients display only the alias for postoffice
groups, not the real addresses. Mail sent to the alias is not delivered.

RESOLUTION
==========

Find the group address using one of the three procedures below and use it when
you send the mail.

 - Record the address when the group is created in the Admin program (LOCAL
   ADMIN-GROUP-CREATE).

 - Export the address list to another postoffice. The group address appears on
   the other postoffice.

 - Make a copy of the \GLB\GROUP.GLB file, from the Microsoft Mail Postoffice,
   and use the MS-DOS TYPE command to list the file. This file is not formatted
   when it appears, but it shows the association of group alias to group name.
