TITLE   :PC DirSync: Err Msg: Fatal 118 Transaction Limit Reached

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the T2 phase of automatic directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) or when
the server transmit process "SRVMAIN -t" is run manually, the following errors
may be displayed:

   Fatal 118 Transaction limit reached

   Fatal 166 Manual Import required for PCM:Network/Postoffice

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the Network/Postoffice indicated in the error message
has requested a Dir-Sync, Import, but the directory server's import response to
the requestor exceeds the message limit that the requestor has specified with
Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Options, Limit.

RESOLUTION
==========

A manual import needs to be done with RESYNC.GLB. RESYNC.GLB can be generated on
the Dir-Sync server by using import with the -s option. The file should be
copied to the GLB subdirectory of the requestor postoffice and Import should be
run with the -q option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The administrator at the requestor postoffice should use RESYNC.GLB before
adding any transactions at the postoffice. If transactions have already been
added, they should be re-added as RESYNC.GLB will change the REQSYNC number in
the REQCONF.GLB causing transactions in REQTRANS.GLB with a lower number than
REQSYNC to be ignored.
