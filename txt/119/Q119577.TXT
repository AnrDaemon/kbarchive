The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

PowerPoint enables you to mark slides as hidden. Normally, hidden slides will
not appear during an on-screen slide show unless you press the on- screen
"hidden slide button" on the previous slide. However, if you hide the first
slide in a presentation, or if you hide multiple, consecutive slides at the
beginning of the presentation, they will appear during the slide show.

CAUSE
=====

Because the decision whether or not to display a hidden slide is based on the
status of the previous slide, PowerPoint cannot hide any slides until after a
non-hidden slide is displayed.
