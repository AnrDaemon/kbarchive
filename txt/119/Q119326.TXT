The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SoundBits version 1.0, Classic Hollywood Movies 
 - Microsoft Sound Bits (Hanna-Barbara) version 1.0 
 - Microsoft SoundBits, Musical Instruments, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a, 2.0, 2.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Non-SoundBits and non-Windows Sound System wave files leave the File Information
box of Sound Control Panel blank with an active Play button.

This is by design. Only the sound files that come with SoundBits and Windows
Sound System display information in the File Information box. Other Microsoft
multimedia products do not provide this additional information.

================

Steps to Reproduce Problem

   NOTE: The File Information box contains a picture and label for the wave file.

3. In the Files box, select a non-SoundBits wave file.

   NOTE: The File Information box does not contain a label for the wave file.
