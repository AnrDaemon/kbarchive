TITLE   :PC Mac: Err Msg: Application 'Unknown' Has Unexpectedly Quit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.1,3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Mac OS (ALL) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may occur when you are signing in to version 2.1,
3.0, or 3.2 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation:

   The application 'unknown' has unexpectedly quit,
   because an error of type 1 occurred. OK?

CAUSE
=====

This error will occur if the file SERIALNO.IDX is missing from the Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks postoffice. SERIALNO.IDX should be in the FOLDERS directory
of the postoffice. For example, if the postoffice is on drive M, the path would
be:

   m:\folders\serialno.idx

NOTE: The Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation does NOT get this
same error message when signing into Mail; therefore, you are able to sign in
successfully.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, restore SERIALNO.IDX from the most recent backup.
However, since SERIALNO.IDX is used to generate unique folder files, the FOLDERS
directory should also be scanned for the newest folder name/number and
SERIALNO.IDX incremented. You can use the MS-DOS DEBUG.COM or DEBUG.EXE to find
the last SERIALNO.IDX.

NOTE: It would take more than 4,000,000 file creations before the numbers would
be reused again.
