-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SNADS, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Windows client receives two message headers for a loopback
message sent by means of the Soft*Switch SNADS or LinkAge SNADS gateways: one in
the FROM: field, the other at the beginning of the message body.

The message appears correctly on the Microsoft Mail MS-DOS client.

A Microsoft Mail loopback message is a message addressed to a Microsoft Mail user
on the other end of the SNADS Gateway, and routed back to the sender.
