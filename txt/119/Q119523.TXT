SUMMARY
=======

When you are troubleshooting printing problems on a notebook computer, first
determine whether the computer is connected to a docking station. If the printer
cable connects to the docking station, the problems may be caused by a poor
connection between the port and its connector in the docking station, or the
connector in the docking station may be defective.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A docking station acts as an intermediate device between the notebook computer
and external devices such as printers, CD players, standard keyboards, and disk
drives. These devices are permanently connected to the docking station. This
allows notebook computer users to use these devices, yet quickly mount or
unmount the computer from them. The computer plugs into the station rather than
the devices.

When you print from a notebook computer connected to a docking station, you may
receive garbled output, even when printing from MS-DOS. If you experience this
problem when your computer is connected to a docking station, do the following
to correct the problem:

1. Turn off the computer and the printer.

2. Disconnect the printer cable from the docking station and connect it to the
   appropriate port on the notebook computer.

3. Turn on both the computer and the printer.

4. Print a text file from MS-DOS (for example, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or the
   SETUP.TXT file from the Windows directory). If this file prints successfully,
   proceed to step 5; if not, use another printer cable and repeat the test. If
   the test fails again, take the computer to a service technician to test the
   port.

5. Continue with the standard Windows printing troubleshooting steps (print from
   Windows Write, print to a file, and so forth).
