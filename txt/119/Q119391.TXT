SUMMARY
=======

If Space Stations or Other Spacecraft is disabled from the Options, Preferences,
Scenery menu, the commands cannot be enabled until you exit and restart Space
Simulator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Once the options for Space Stations or Other Spacecraft are disabled, Space
Simulator completely disables the rendering of all space stations or spacecraft
other than the active craft. Even though the check boxes for the options can be
reselected, Space Simulator will not enable the rendering for those objects. To
enable rendering for Space Stations or Other Spacecraft, exit and restart Space
Simulator.

This is a limitation of Microsoft Space Simulator version 1.0.
