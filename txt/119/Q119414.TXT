The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows derives all of its addressing
information from one file, RNETWORK.GLB. This file is created by the Microsoft
Mail administrator and is placed on the user's data disk during the Remote,
Init_Disk process. When the remote user requests an update of address lists, an
updated version of this file is downloaded from the postoffice.

During the installation of the data disk:

 - The remote client parses RNETWORK.GLB and creates a pseudo postoffice in the
   WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT subdirectory. The pseudo postoffice consists of the ATT,
   GLB, INF, KEY, MAI, MBG, NME, P1, TPL, USERINFO, USR, and XTN directories.

 - Once RNETWORK.GLB has been converted to the postoffice addressing scheme, a
   REBUILD routine (a modified version of Dir-Sync GAL REBUILD) is invoked to
   build the GAL comprising of GAL.NME, GALINDEX.GLB, and GALNETPO.GLB.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If EXTERNAL.EXE is active around 4 A.M., it will regenerate the default view for
the remote users (for example, RNETWORK.GLB). External will not regenerate
custom views that are stored in xxxxxxxx.GLB.
