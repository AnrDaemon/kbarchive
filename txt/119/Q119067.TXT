======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you press the F4 key when the "Starting Windows 95" message appears, your
computer may not start with your previous version of MS-DOS. You may see the
"Starting MS-DOS" message, but shortly after this message appears, your computer
restarts and the "Starting Windows 95" message is displayed again.

CAUSE
=====

QEMM versions 7.03 and later install a utility called DOSDATA.SYS in the
CONFIG.SYS file. When this file is read, it forces the computer to reboot so
that it can optimize memory allocations made from the first boot cycle. Windows
95 does not support the DOSDATA.SYS utility included with QEMM versions 7.03 and
later.

RESOLUTION
==========

To boot MS-DOS, follow these steps:

1. Press F4 when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message.

2. The computer reboots after DOSDATA.SYS is read and displays "Starting Windows
   95" again.

3. Press F4 when you see "Starting Windows 95" the second time. This allows the
   computer to continue booting MS-DOS.

-or-

1. Remark out any statements for QEMM in the CONFIG.SYS file by placing a
   semicolon before those statements and then reboot your computer.

   NOTE: If you are running Windows 95 (not your previous version of MS-DOS),
   modify the CONFIG.DOS file, not the CONFIG.SYS file. If you booted MS-DOS,
   modify the CONFIG.SYS file.

2. Press F4 when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message.

NOTE: You may have to edit your MSDOS.SYS file to boot your previous version of
MS-DOS. For additional information, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
