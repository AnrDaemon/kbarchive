TITLE   :PRB: File "C:\TEMP\99999999.TMP" Does Not Exist
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5x,2.6x,3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are trying to create a new screen or report, the error message "File
'C:\TEMP\<99999999.TMP>' does not exist" appears, where
<99999999.TMP> is any random combination of numbers.

CAUSE
=====

When you open a new screen file (*.SCX) or a report file (*.FRX), FoxPro creates
a temporary file. The filename for this temporary file will be eight randomly
generated numbers with an extension of .TMP. If there is a TMPFILES = statement
in the CONFIG.FPW file and the directory pointed to by that statement does not
exist, FoxPro generates the error mentioned above.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that the TMPFILES = statement in the CONFIG.FPW file specifies a valid
directory. For example, if the TMPFILES = statement is

   TMPFILES = C:\TEMP

make sure TEMP is a valid directory that exists on drive C.

NOTE: This problem also occurs when the TEMP directory is hidden.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. In the Command window, type the following:

   " MODIFY FILE c:\<FoxPro_directory>\config.fpw" (without the quotation
   marks)

2. Either modify the existing TMPFILES statement or create a new statement that
   directs the temporary files to a directory that does not exist. For example:

   TMPFILES = C:\BADDIR

3. Save the file and then quit FoxPro.

4. Restart FoxPro for Windows.

5. In the Command window, type either of the following commands:

   " CREATE REPORT" (without the quotation marks)

   -or-

   " CREATE SCREEN" (without the quotation marks)

You will receive the following error message (note that the 9's can be any
numbers):

   File 'C:\baddir\99999999.tmp' does not exist
