-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to AT T, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.0 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to AT&T Mail cannot operate if
the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP is installed on the same postoffice.

Version 1.1 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to AT&T Mail, however, can
coexist with the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP on the same physical
Microsoft Mail shared file system postoffice, if you use ADPROC.EXE--the
SMTP address preprocessor executable provided by AT&T. This takes the
place of SMTPGET.EXE for both the AT&T and the SMTP gateways.

AT&T supports ADPROC.EXE. Their support center number is 1-800-624-5672.
