The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

In MASM 6.1 there are four new distance specifiers: near16, near32, far16, and
far32.

A near pointer consists of an offset. A near16 pointer is a near pointer that
consists of a 16 bit offset. A near32 pointer is a near pointer consisting of a
32 bit offset. A far pointer is a pointer that consists of both a segment and an
offset. A far16 pointer is a far pointer that consists of a segment and a 16 bit
offset. A far32 pointer is a far pointer consisting of a segment and a 32 bit
offset. Segments are always 16 bits. Note: near32 and far32 pointers are only
available on 386 and successive processors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The properties of the new distance specifiers are summarized by the following
table:
