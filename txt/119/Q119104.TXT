TITLE   :PPT: Incorrect Title Case Change When Word Contains Apostrophe
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:4.0; WINDOWS:4.0,4.0a,4.0c,7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Change Case command in PowerPoint to change text containing an
apostrophe to Title Case, the text may capitalize incorrectly. For example, if
you select the text

   Bob's
   Bob's car
   Joe's

and use the Change Case command to change the case to Title Case, the text may
appear as:

   Bob'S
   Bob'S Car
   Joe's

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs when the apostrophe in the selection is followed by a hard
carriage return. In the above example, "Joe's" appears correctly because the
hard carriage return was not selected during the case change. Individual words
also display the same problem if the highlighted region includes the hard
carriage return. This problem actually occurs with any punctuation mark,
although apostrophes are the only punctuation marks found in the middle of
words.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, select each word or sentence individually without
selecting the hard carriage return character, and then change the case.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft PowerPoint 97
for Windows and Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition.
