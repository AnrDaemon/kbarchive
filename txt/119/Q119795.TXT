KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for MS-DOS, version 3.2 
 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Recent updates do not appear, even after a user downloads the address book.

CAUSE
=====

If the remote user is configured for a custom view rather than the default view,
the custom view must be updated before the remote clients will see the changes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Start the ADMIN.EXE program on the postoffice where the remote user's account
resides and perform the following steps:

1. Select Remote, Views, Modify.

2. Select the first view and press ENTER, then press the ESC key. The view name
   will be displayed. Do not make any changes.

3. Press ENTER. You will be prompted to modify. Select Yes.

Repeat these steps for all of the custom views. The next time the remote user
downloads his or her address book, the updated address list will appear.
