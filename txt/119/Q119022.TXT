SYMPTOMS
========

Mail sent from a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice to a Microsoft Mail
for AppleTalk Networks server by means of the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC
and AppleTalk Networks may become stuck in the outbound connection gateway queue
on the PC postoffice and be delivered repeatedly to Macintosh server recipients.
This stuck message may also block any gateway traffic queued behind it.

This problem appears mostly in Novell NetWare-based network operating systems.
Its specific cause is still under investigation.

   message in the queue.

Workaround 3
------------

1. Stop the MACGATE.EXE program.

2. Move any mail messages found in the PCTOMAC subdirectory to a temporary
   location.

4. Move each of the mail messages from the temporary location back to the
   PCTOMAC subdirectory one at a time until the problem message is found.

5. Delete the problem message.
