SUMMARY
=======

LINK error L2023 is caused by an incorrect library link order. The linker
resolves external references in order of appearance of the libraries, choosing
the first occurrence of a label. This error occurs when a dynamic- link library
(DLL) exports the routine Windows exit procedure (WEP) that will be brought in
from the C Run-time library static .OBJs, but the linker finds another DLL's WEP
in its .LIB file because it appears BEFORE the C Run-time library.

It would be best if DLL import libraries didn't include the WEP. This is possible
by using the PRIVATE keyword in you .DEF file when exporting your WEP. Or, edit
the .LIB via the LIB.EXE utility to remove the WEP reference.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the MFC libraries are used, they should be included before any other
libraries. As for the other libraries, the Windows libraries should be included
first (that is, LIBW, COMMDLG, SHELL, and so forth), the C Run- time second
(that is, xLIBCyW.LIB for applications or xDLLCyW.LIB for DLLs), and any
additional third-party libraries last (that is, your own or other's .LIBs). For
example, when linking a small model DLL that uses another DLL's routines via an
import library, the library order would be "LIBW.LIB SDLLCEW.LIB OTHERDLL.LIB".
The order should be changed only if a DLL routine was to replace one of the
routines in the Windows libraries or CRT.
