TITLE   :User Manager Focus on Machine Name Instead of Domain Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When User Manager starts on a domain controller, instead of focusing on the
current domain, it focuses on the machine name.

CAUSE
=====

User Manager is in the Startup group in Program Manager. Because it takes some
time for Netlogon services to start, User Manager is started before the network
is running. With only the machine name available and the domain not up yet, User
Manager can only focus on the machine.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not automatically start User Manager by putting it in the Startup group.
Start User Manager a little after booting the domain controller.
