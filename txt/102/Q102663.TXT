SUMMARY
=======

Pages 160-161 in the "LAN Manager Installation and Configuration Guide" version
2.2, reverses the correct positions of the NCB and SESSIONS parameters.

On page 160, in the list of parameters that can follow the netn= entry in the
[networks] section of the LANMAN.INI file, Number of Sessions should be the
fourth parameter and Number of NCBs should be the fifth. Here is the proper
order:

   Devicename

   LANA number

   Type

   Number of sessions

   Number of NCBs

   Number of names

On page 161, the example entry should read as follows:

  net2 = netbeui$, 0, lm10, 15, 30, 6

This entry tells NetBEUI to reserve 15 sessions, 30 NCBs, and 6 names for LAN
Manager. This leaves 25 sessions, 55 NCBs, and 11 names for NetBIOS 3.0
applications.

The correct format is shown on page 234 in the "Microsoft LAN Manager
Administrator's Reference" version 2.2. Also see page 9-14 in the "3+Open LAN
Manager Technical Reference."
