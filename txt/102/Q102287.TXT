======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, versions 2.0, 2.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open a file using the File Open dialog box, the error "File Not
Found" or "File Does Not Exist" may occur.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the FoxUSER file is not present in the System Folder or
when there is an INIT or Extension conflict.

Other possible causes include having multiple FoxUSER files on the system, a
corrupted FoxUSER file, or a database file with an extension other than .DBF.

RESOLUTION
==========

To determine if there is an INIT or Extension conflict, disable all Extensions
or INITs, as follows:

 - Under System 7.0, press the SHIFT key while restarting the machine to disable
   all Extensions. Once the logo "Welcome to Macintosh/Extensions Off" appears,
   release the SHIFT key.

 - Under System 6.0x, drag each INIT out of the System Folder and restart the
   Macintosh.

NOTE: You may not be able to remove all the Extensions or INITs; some may be
needed to run the Macintosh. Remove as many INITs or Extensions as possible.
