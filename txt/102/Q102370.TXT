SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT PIF Editor can't save long filenames or use names with spaces.

CAUSE
=====

PIF Editor is a 32-bit application and should therefore be able to deal with
long filenames or a space in a filename. However, since PIF Editor is dedicated
to Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) support, it is limited (by design) to the
eight-character filename, three character extension (8.3) convention.
