PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

A customer reported losing connection with Apple printers such as the
Laserwriter II NT printer. The network was connected to Ethernet through an
ETHERLINK box (which converts LOCALTALK to ETHERTALK) and used servers loaded
with LM QUEUES.

CAUSE
=====

This can be due to Mac Services being out of date or missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure you are running Mac Services 1.0a--check the dates on files in
C:\LANMAN\MACINTOSH 1/14/93. If you are not running the most current version,
load it and try capturing the Apple printer again.
