When I use the WS_MIMIMIZEBOX or WS_MAXIMIZEBOX styles in a dialog box with a
DS_MODALFRAME style, the up/down arrows are offset up and to the right when I
click them with the mouse.

CAUSE

The WS_MINIMIZEBOX and WS_MAXIMIZEBOX styles cannot be used with the
DS_MODALFRAME frame style. (Menus are also incompatible with this frame style.
