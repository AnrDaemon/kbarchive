MORE INFORMATION
================

Registry Entries for Printing:

The Registry contains printer information in these locations:

The per-user settings for the current default printer are stored under this key:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Printers

The hardware-specific information about drivers and print processors is stored
under this key, where Hardware represents the subkey for a specific Windows NT
platform, such as Windows NT x86 or Windows NT R4000:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print

Always use Print Manager or the Printers folder to change configuration settings
for all printers.

Printing Entries for Users:

The following Registry path contains a description of the default printer, as
selected by the current user:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Printers

The following Registry paths contain the user preferences for print devices in
Windows NT 4.0:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Devices

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion \PrinterPorts

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

The Device value in the following Registry path contains the user's default
printer:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows

The following Registry path contains the user preferences for Print Manager in
Windows NT 3.51 and earlier:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion \Print Manager

   NOTE: The above Registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

These standard entries appear:

   Network   REG_DWORD
   Default:   0x1

   Print Manager   REG_BINARY
   Default:

   Save Settings   REG_DWORD
   Default:   0x1

Control\Print Entries for the Computer:

The principal information for printers appears under the following Registry
path:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print

This path contains additional subkeys that define supporting DLLs, drivers, and
other necessary information for installed printers. These subkeys can include
Environments, Forms, Monitors, Printers, and Providers. An OEM print provider
might also add subkeys under this Registry path.

Print Environments Entries:

The following Registry path contains these subkeys, each of which can contain a
value entry defining the directory that contains the appropriate drivers:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments
   \Windows NT Alpha_AXP
   \Windows NT Alpha_AXP\Drivers
   \Windows NT Alpha_AXP\Print Processors
   \Windows NT R4000
   \Windows NT R4000\Drivers
   \Windows NT R4000\Print Processors
   \Windows NT x86

   NOTE: The above Registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

A PrinterDriverName subkey under the related Drivers subkey can contain these
values:

   Configuration File   REG_SZ
   Default:   Installed DLL filename

   Data File            REG_SZ
   Default:   Installed .PPD filename

   Driver               REG_SZ
   Default:   Installed driver DLL filename

   Version              REG_DWORD
   Default:   Version number

A Print Processors subkey (and subsequent subkeys) under this same Registry path
contains an entry of the following type:

   Driver               REG_SZ
   Default:   winprint.dll

Print Monitors Entries:

The entry in the following path defines the DLL filename for the appropriate
print monitor:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors
   \<Provider Network Port>

   NOTE: The above Registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

Driver   REG_SZ   DLL filename:

The Options subkey for the Hewlett-Packard Network Port contains the following

   DlcT1Timer=0x5
   DlcT2Timer=0x2
   DlcTiTimer=0x3
   EventLogging=0x7
   LinkStationsUsed=0x40
   StatusUpdateInterval=0x3c

Printers Entries:

Each installed printer has a subkey in the following Registry path:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Printers

   readability.
