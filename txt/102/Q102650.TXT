When a trust relationship is broken at one end, whether it is due to a
server going down or someone removing the relationship from User
Manager, it is not enough to add the trust relationship back into the
domain that the relationship was broken from. Administrators from the
domains involved must remove the trust relationship and recreate the
trusts again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a trust relationship is established between two domains, the password used
to create the relationship is immediately changed by the operating system, even
if there was no initial password. The controllers and servers for both domains
know the new password. The new password is not visible to the users, however.
This password change happens regularly to provide extra security. Because of
this, once the trust relationship is broken, the only way to reestablish the
trust is to reset it completely on both ends, which serves to reset the
password.

One side effect of the automatic password change is that the administrator of the
trusting domain gets only one chance to create the trust relationship once the
administrator of the trusted domain has set up the other end. If the password is
typed incorrectly, it will no longer be valid, as the system will have
automatically changed it. In this situation, the administrator of the trusted
domain must remove the trusting domain from his or her list of "domains
permitted to trust" and add it back in again, then the administrator on the
other end should try again to establish the relationship.
