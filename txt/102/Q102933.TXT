======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, groups defined
by the network manager may contain users that were recently removed from the
mail system. (To reveal a user who was removed, select the specific group from
the addressing screen and click Details.)

Mail messages addressed to the group will be correctly delivered to any valid
user accounts. At the same time, the message will be ignored for the user whose
account was removed. However, no error message is returned to the sender of the
message.

In addition, if the same user name is added to the mail system again, that user
name will propagate to other servers and will be displayed in the All List. At
the same time, the "old" account information is still displayed in the group
details. This may confuse some users because the listing in the group details
does not refer to the newly created user; rather, it refers incorrectly to the
previously removed user.

CAUSE
=====

These symptoms occur if a user is added to a group and is then removed from the
group server's All List before the group's changes propagate to other servers.
The user name will be retained in the group definition even though the user has
been deleted.

Specifically, if the group definition propagates to the All List before the
request to delete the user, the user will correctly be removed from the All
List, and thus the group as well. However, if the user is removed from the All
list before the new (or modified) group definition arrives, or if the user is
deleted before he or she is added to the group server's All List, the Mail
server does not check the members of the groups to make sure they still exist.
Therefore, it is possible to encounter a case where a group contains members who
no longer exist as local users on any server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, the network manager must modify any groups the old user
appears in. This modification must take place on each server where the group was
originally defined. Once the old user name definition is removed, the group
details will display correctly. Additionally, the network manager can then add
the new user definition.
