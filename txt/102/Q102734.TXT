TITLE   :PRB: GET Objects w/ MS Sans Serif Font Look Strange in Win 3.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,2.5a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

GET objects created with the MS Sans Serif font (or any TrueType font) in FoxPro
for Windows while it is running in the Windows version 3.1 environment will not
look correct when the program is run in the Windows version 3.0 environment.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the MS Sans Serif font is unavailable in Windows
3.0 and a bitmapped font is used instead. As a result, the font will look
different and spacing problems, such edit regions overflowing into push buttons
on the screen, will occur.

This behavior is noticeable when using RQBE to send output to a graph. The
GraphWizard uses the MS Sans Serif font.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use fonts that are available to both Windows 3.0
and 3.1. For example, use one of the fonts that shipped with Windows 3.0, such
as Courier, Helv, or Tms Rmn.

REFERENCES

3.1.
