======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The version 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 Microsoft Mail for Windows mail spooler
suppresses the New Mail notification for messages whose message type begins with
"IPC."

CAUSE
=====

This is was by design. IPC messages do not appear in the Inbox; therefore, it
would be undesirable to ring the bell and display the New Mail icon.

This also implies that if you are a developer writing an application that uses
IPC-type messages, you need to poll for new mail.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.00b 3.20 Simple MAPI
