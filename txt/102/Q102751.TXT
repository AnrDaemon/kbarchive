TITLE   :PC DOS: Err Msg: The Folder Is Busy...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access a folder in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation, the following error message may
appear:

   The folder is busy. Please try again. If the problem persists,
   please contact the system administrator

CAUSE
=====

A folder may be left locked open for several reasons, such as a hardware
failure. A locked folder cannot be deleted, sorted, or compressed. These locks
are called semaphore locks, and are used to prevent simultaneous access to
folders.

RESOLUTION
==========

The FOLDCOMP utility (FOLDCOMP.EXE) is used to recover disk space from private
folders stored on a user's local PC (rather than on the server). Space will only
be recovered if mail has been deleted since the last folder compress with
FOLDCOMP.

You can use the FOLDCOMP utility's -S parameter to override and reset the
semaphore locks on folders. You should only use this parameter if there is a
persistent problem with deleting, re-sorting, or compressing the folders. You
can use the -S parameter to unlock a folder in this state. However, you should
take care not to reset the lock while the folder is actually in use.

Usage
-----

Change to the directory where the private folders are stored. Run FOLDCOMP.EXE.

Example
-------

The following command will run the FOLDCOMP utility on the folders in the current
directory, resetting the semaphore locks and using the sort order of the
database on drive M:

   foldcomp -dm -s

NOTE: FOLDCOMP.EXE will not except a path statement on the command line. The
mapped drive must be in the FOLDER\PUB directory or the file FOLDCOMP.EXE must
be run in the FOLDER\PUB directory in order to work.

MORE INFORMATION
================
