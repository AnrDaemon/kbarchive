The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run Windows in 386 enhanced mode, you receive the following
error message:

   Invalid VxD dynamic link call to device number 000D, service number 000E.
   Your Windows configuration is invalid. Run the Windows setup program again to
   correct this problem.

CAUSE
=====

Device number 000D means that the error was caused by a call to the virtual
keyboard device referenced in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. The
default Windows entry is:

        Keyboard=*vkd

The Microsoft Mouse Setup version 9.0 changes this line to read:

        Keyboard=C:\MOUSE\MOUSEVKD.386

Third-party mouse drivers may change this line to reference a different keyboard
driver. If Windows cannot find the driver because it has been deleted or is
corrupted, or the keyboard= entry is missing or blank, the dynamic link call
error message appears.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you remove the Microsoft Mouse driver 9.0 and are using Microsoft Mouse
driver 8.2, you can prevent the error message by changing the keyboard line in
the [386Enh] section to read as follows:

        Keyboard=*vkd

If you are still using Microsoft Mouse driver 9.0, run Microsoft Mouse 9.0 Setup
again to correct this error.
