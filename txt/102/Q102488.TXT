SYMPTOMS

When you use Norton Utility's Directory Assistance II version 2.0 on a Macintosh
with a 9-inch screen (Mac Plus, SE, SE/30, Classic, and Classic II) and you
choose the enclosure button, two errors occur.

The following Directory Assistance error occurs and the Directory Assistance icon
appears with an X through it, to the left of the text:

   Dialog box too large

This error vanishes after a short time, then the following alert from Microsoft
Mail for AppleTalk Networks appears:

   Sorry, there is not enough memory to complete the operation

If you are running System 6.x and you click OK, you will return to the Note
screen. If you are running System 7, either you will return to the Note screen
or the Enclosure dialog box will appear.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are running System 6.x, remove Directory Assistance II from the System
Folder and restart (reboot) the computer. If you are running System 7.0 or 7.1,
remove the Init from the Extensions Folder (located in the System Folder) and
reboot the computer.
