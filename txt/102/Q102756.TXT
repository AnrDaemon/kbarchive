TITLE   :PC Forms: Deleted Form Does Not Appear in Wastebasket
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, messages created using
custom forms may not appear in the Wastebasket folder when they are deleted.
This can occur if you read a message and then delete it by choosing the Delete
command from File menu of the custom form. However, you can move the message to
the Wastebasket by selecting it from the list of messages in the Message Center
Viewer (the main window) and choosing the Delete button from the Toolbar.

CAUSE
=====

The Delete command on the File menu of a custom form calls the MAPIDelete()
function. The MAPIDelete function deletes mail; it does not move mail to the
Wastebasket first.

The Mail client, on the other hand, moves mail to the Wastebasket folder when you
choose the Delete button. It calls the MAPIDelete() function to remove mail only
when the Wastebasket is "emptied."
