When a version 2.1 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice (PO) is updated to
version 3.0, the version 2.1 GRPMEM.GLB "delete status" variable is changed to
"not deleted". The Boolean logic is also changed at this time (for example, if
the delete status=0, it will be changed to not deleted=1).

The GRPMEM.GLB file contains each user's mailbag number and points to all of the
.MEM files for each group the user is a member of.
