-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Standard Microsystems Corporation (SMC) 3008 network card, the
following error message may be displayed when you start Workgroups Connection on
an 8088/8086 (XT) computer:

   Error 50: This request is not supported by the network.

CAUSE
=====

This error may occur if the 8088/8086 computer is incorrectly identified during
Setup as an IBM PC/AT-compatible machine. This prevents proper operation of the
SMC 3008 network card.

RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate the above error message, use a text editor (such as MS-DOS Editor)
to add the following line to the [MS$SMC3K] section of the PROTOCOL.INI file in
the DOS directory:

       [MS$SMC3K]

       XT_TYPE = 1

If the initial sign-on message indicates the incorrect machine type, you can set
an optional parameter (XT_TYPE) to override the automatic determination of
computer type. The setting XT_TYPE = 1 informs Protocol Manager that the
computer is an 8088/8086 computer. The setting XT_TYPE = 0 informs Protocol
Manager that the computer is an IBM PC/AT-compatible computer.

The SMC 3000 Series network interface cards (NICs) are manufactured by Standard
Microsystems Corporation, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or
reliability.
