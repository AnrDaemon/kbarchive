SUMMARY
=======

The Adaptec 1510 SCSI host adapter must be configured in the following manner in
order for it to work under Windows NT:

   SCSI Disconnection        Enabled
   SCSI Address              7
   SCSI Parity               Enabled
   Synchronous Negotiation   Enabled
   Interrupt Channel (IRQ)   11
   I/O Port Address          340h


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT device driver for the Adaptec 1510 adapter is SPARROW.SYS. The
driver is hard-coded for the parameters listed above. Although MS-DOS device
drivers, by the use of switches, can specify adapter-related parameters, such as
IRQ and parity, this cannot be done under Windows NT. Make sure you attach only
SCSI targets to the Adaptec 1510 adapter that support the settings listed above.
Note that since the adapter always uses IRQ 11 and does not report this fact,
conflicts with other devices using the same IRQ may occur.

NOTE: The driver for the Adaptec 1520 SCSI host adapter does not have this
limitation.
