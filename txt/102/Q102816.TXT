======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


You may have difficulty running MemMaker on an IBM PS/1 machine.

CAUSE
=====

This difficulty may be caused by the PS/1 System menu, which is preinstalled by
IBM.

During the execution of MemMaker, the following lines appear at the end of the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   C:\DOS\SIZER.EXE /M
   C:\DOS\MEMMAKER.EXE /SESSION:xxxxx

However, these lines are never reached due to the execution of START.BAT or the
PS/1 shell program (SHELLSTB.COM or RSSTUB.COM); therefore, MemMaker never
finishes examining the system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correctly examine the system with MemMaker, the files C:\PSTOOLS\START.BAT
and SHELLSTB.COM (or RSSTUB.COM) must be remarked out or removed from the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. After you run MemMaker, these menu programs can be replaced.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IBM PS/1 machines include the following terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
programs and other programs in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   C:\PS1TOOLS\VSTOP.COM
   C:\PS1TOOLS\HWCHECK.EXE
   C:\PS1TOOLS\START.BAT

The TSR VSTOP.COM is a virus-protection utility. HWCHECK.EXE is a
hardware-checking program. START.BAT launches Microsoft Windows and brings back
the four-quadrant screen (System menu) when you quit Windows. Choices available
on the System menu may include IBM-DOS, Information, Your Software, Prodigy,
Promenade, and/or Microsoft Works. There are over 70 varieties of the PS/1,
which accounts for the variety of choices on System menus.

In addition to the files mentioned above, either SHELLSTB.COM or RSSTUB.COM
launches the System menu. This should be remarked out as well for the proper
running of MemMaker.

The PS/1 is manufactured by IBM, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
