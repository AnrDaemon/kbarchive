SUMMARY
=======

You can modify an external project makefile to generate source browser database
information. However, to use the browser database, you must have either
Programmer's WorkBench, Visual C++ for Windows or Visual C++ 32-bit edition. You
must also have the BSCMAKE utility installed in one of the directories listed in
your PATH environment variable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The text below assumes that you are creating a new makefile for a specified
project. The process of porting a .MAK file generated by Programmer's WorkBench
or by Visual Workbench involves other considerations that this article does not
discuss.

Source browser database information can be very helpful during the development
process as well as in the debugging process. Typically, an external makefile
does not call the BSCMAKE utility to generate a browser database. The five steps
required to add the dependencies to generate browser information are quite
simple and are as follows:

1. Add the "/FR" compiler option switch to each C/C++ compiler command line or
   to the variable that lists the compiler option switches. For example:

         CFLAGS = /Od /Zi /FR

   This variable is typically used to specify the command line for each object
   module as follows:

         CL /c $(CFLAGS) $(PROJ).C

2. Generate a .SBR file for each source file by adding a <name>.SBR target
   for each source file in the project, as follows:

         source1.sbr: source1.c
            cl /c $(CFLAGS) source.c

   If you delete the .SBR files but the project is otherwise up-to- date, BSCMAKE
   may fail to update the .SBR files.

3. Add a substitution variable that contains the list of .SBR files that
   compiler generates in response to the specified /FR compiler option switch:

         SBRS = source1.sbr source2.sbr source3.sbr     # and so on

4. Create an "ALL" pseudotarget and include the .BSC dependency using the
   project name as the base filename. Most makefiles define a variable to hold
   the project name for this purpose. For example,

         PROJ = proj1
         ALL: $(PROJ).exe $(PROJ).bsc

5. Finally, create the dependency that calls BSCMAKE to build the browser
   database file as follows:

         $(PROJ).bsc : $(SBRS)
            BSCMAKE /o$@ $(SBRS)

For more information about BSCMAKE or NMAKE options or commands, please refer to
the following resources provided with Visual C++ version 1.0 for Windows:
BSCMAKE.WRI or NMAKE.WRI installed in the Visual C++ help directory (by default,
C:\MSVC\HELP). You can also view these files through the "Tech Notes" icon in
the Visual C++ program group in Microsoft Windows Program Manager.

For more information about the BSCMAKE utility provided with Visual C++ 32-bit
edition, please refer to the Build Tools online help listed on the development
environment Help menu. For more information about NMAKE, please refer to the
NMAKE.WRI file in the HELP subdirectory.

Sample External makefile for Visual C++ for Windows
---------------------------------------------------

   PROJ=hello
   SBRS=hello.sbr
   CFLAGS = /Od /Zi /FR

   all: $(PROJ).exe $(PROJ).bsc

   hello.sbr:  hello.c
      cl /c $(CFLAGS) hello.c

   hello.obj:  hello.c
      cl /c $(CFLAGS) hello.c

   hello.exe:  hello.obj
      link /co hello.obj;

   hello.bsc:  $(SBRS)
      bscmake /o$@ $(SBRS)

Sample External makefile for Visual C++ 32-bit Edition
------------------------------------------------------

   PROJ=hello
   SBRS=hello.sbr

   CFLAGS = /Od /Zi /FR

   all: $(PROJ).exe $(PROJ).bsc

   hello.sbr:  hello.c
      cl /c $(CFLAGS) hello.c

   hello.obj:  hello.c
      cl /c $(CFLAGS) hello.c

   hello.exe:  hello.obj
      link /debug /debugtype:both hello.obj

   hello.bsc:  $(SBRS)
      bscmake /o$@ $(SBRS)
