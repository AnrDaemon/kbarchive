The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks allow you to
create custom forms using the Form Designer stack and HyperCard.

In addition to a familiar design interface, the HyperCard program includes a
powerful scripting language. When a form is compiled and installed, however,
common HyperCard scripts are ignored.

You can add "compile" scripts to a form to add complex features. When you choose
the Compile button, it sends out a Compile command.

To customize a form, you can add code to the Compile command to tell the
compiling script to set certain attributes for a particular object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

One security feature available through these compile scripts allows you to make
all characters entered into a field appear as bullets (similar to the password
box in the Sign-On screen). To do this, follow the steps below to add a script
to a field on the Send screen:

1. Create a generic single-line field named "Password" on the Send screen.

2. Set the HyperCard user level so scripting is available. (Press COMMAND+M to
   bring up the message box. Type the following command and press ENTER:

   " set userlevel to 5 " (without the quotation marks)

3. Choose the Field tool and double-click the Password field to display the Info
   box. Choose the Script button.

4. Add the following script to the field:

         on compile
            global objType, fieldHiddenText
            put fieldHiddenText into objType
         end compile

5. Recompile the Send screen by choosing the Compile button.

NOTE: The text will display as bullets on the Send screen but will be visible on
the Read screen. This feature is useful for entering confidential information,
such as passwords.
