-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 3.14, 4.0, 4.01 
 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 3.14, 4.0, 4.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the following documentation, CodeView error messages are listed in
alphabetical order rather than in numerical order:
 

 - CodeView version 3.14 messages in the Microsoft FORTRAN "Environment and
   Tools" manual for version 5.1

 - CodeView versions 4.0 and 4.01 messages in the Microsoft C/C++ "Comprehensive
   Index and Errors Reference" manual for version 7.0

CodeView usually displays error messages in a pop-up window when you
step through code. The manuals list the error messages in alphabetical
order to ease the process of cross referencing an error message on the
screen with its complete description in the manual.

Additional query words: kbinf 4.00
