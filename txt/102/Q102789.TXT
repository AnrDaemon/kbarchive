SUMMARY
=======

In versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, Gateway
Services (GWS) manages Mail's interaction with gateways.

GWS is installed when MS Mail GW is loaded at startup time. GWS schedules when
each of the gateways installed on the Mail server is to run. When you choose the
Update button in the Gateway Connect Times screen, a mail message containing the
selected times/options is sent to GWS.

When it is time for a gateway to run, GWS creates an environment in which the
gateway code will run, downloads the gateway code from the Mail server, and then
gives control to the gateway code.

GWS has its own mail inbox. The Outbound Gateway Queue, which you can view from
the Mail Network Administrator program Global Server Report, is the inbox for
GWS.

All outgoing gateway messages are first put in the GWS inbox. GWS then puts a
copy of the mail message in the outgoing queue for each appropriate gateway and
then runs each gateway at the proper time. When the last gateway has deleted an
outgoing gateway message, GWS deletes the copy in its inbox.

When you view the Outbound Gateway Queue in the Mail Network Administrator
program, you are looking at the current outbound gateway messages.
