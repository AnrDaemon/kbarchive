The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Importing an existing LMHOSTS file from your own machine's
<winnt>\system32\drivers\etc\lmhosts directory nulls out the file and
leaves an empty file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server version
3.5.

To work around this problem, copy the LMHOSTS file to another directory on the
drive and import it from there.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1 and
Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in Windows NT
Workstation or Server version 3.5.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Choose the Network icon in Control Panel.

2. In the Installed Network Software box, select TCP/IP Protocol, and choose
   Configure.

3. Choose Import LMHOST.

4. Enter the path to the existing LMHOSTS file
   <winnt>\system32\drivers\etc\lmhosts where <winnt> is the name of
   the Windows NT program directory.

The operation will succeed, but the resulting LMHOSTS file is empty and is the
same size as the original.
