SUMMARY
=======

According to the online help, an application should not process either the
BN_DISABLE or BN_DOUBLECLICKED notification. The documentation recommends that
new applications should use the BS_OWNERDRAW button style and information in the
DRAWITEMSTRUCT structure.

These statements are incorrect and should be ignored. Even though an application
can create the same behavior using an owner-draw button, it is not necessary to
do so.
