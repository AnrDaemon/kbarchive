 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

Windows NT supports both file transfer protocol (FTP) and trivial file
transfer protocol (TFTP) under its implementation of TCP/IP. Both of these
protocols can be used for transferring files across the Internet. The
differences between the two protocols are explained below:

 - FTP is a complete, session-oriented, general purpose file transfer protocol.
   TFTP is used as a bare-bones special purpose file transfer protocol.

 - FTP can be used interactively. TFTP allows only unidirectional transfer of
   files.

 - FTP depends on TCP, is connection oriented, and provides reliable control.
   TFTP depends on UDP, requires less overhead, and provides virtually no
   control.

 - FTP provides user authentication. TFTP does not.

 - FTP uses well-known TCP port numbers: 20 for data and 21 for connection
   dialog. TFTP uses UDP port number 69 for its file transfer activity.

 - The Windows NT FTP server service does not support TFTP because TFTP does not
   support authentication.

 - Windows 95 and TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups do not include a TFTP
   client program.
