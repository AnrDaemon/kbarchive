Windows 16-bit applications sometimes display messages that indicate
problems such as "Out of memory" or "Insufficient system resources"
instead of the true nature of the problem: a 16-bit printer driver has
been designated as the default printer. You may not have done this
intentionally: some 16-bit programs, during setup, install a 16-bit
printer driver as the default printer for the system.

With a 16-bit default driver installed, Win32 API printer function
calls start failing because of the design incompatibility of the API function and the driver. 
These failures cause programs to display meaningless "informative" messages.

To correct this problem, use the Windows NT Print Manager to install a
different printer as the default (even if there isn't really a printer
attached).
