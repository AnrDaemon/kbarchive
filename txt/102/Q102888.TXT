The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

NTFS security permissions are reset when you save a file from Microsoft Word for
Windows or Microsoft Excel.

CAUSE
=====

When Word or Excel opens a file for editing, it saves a copy of the original
file as a temporary file, and uses the temporary file for storing modifications.
When you issue a Save command, the original file is deleted, and the temporary
file is renamed to the original file name. Since newly created files in a
directory inherit the security permissions of that directory, the security
permissions on the file will be reset to those of the directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

One possible workaround is to place all public files in the same directory and
assign the permissions there. If a file needs specific permissions, then this
file is probably for a specific group or user and should be in the user's home
directory or a subdirectory of it with special permissions.

Another workaround is to modify the permissions on the directory and the file to
prevent the user from overwriting the original file. This can be accomplished by
modifying the permissions on the directory and file to not allow file deletions.
