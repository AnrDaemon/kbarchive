======================================================================
Although the error message NET3100 indicates that a "software error
occurred," it almost always actually indicates a physical net
problem. If you receive it only once or twice, it could mean that
someone unplugged a cable and then plugged it back in. If you
receive it several times, check concentrator cards, hubs, medium
attachment units (modems) cables and net cards.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 2.10a 2.20 2.0 2.1 2.1a 2.2
