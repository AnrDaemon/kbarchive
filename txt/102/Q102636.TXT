The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Video for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Video for Windows VidEdit doesn't work with Windows NT. VidEdit uses a 16- bit
multimedia driver instead of the multimedia application program interface (API)
functions. Other Video for Windows functions may not work correctly under
Windows NT because not all Video-related APIs and messages are translated (or
"thunked") for 16-bit support.
