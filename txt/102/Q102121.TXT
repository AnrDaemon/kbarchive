-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running version 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks
and versions of DCA's IRMA WorkStation for Mac earlier than version 3.0.1, the
Macintosh may occasionally freeze or lock up.

CAUSE
=====

The IRMA driver remaps the keyboard. This particular remapping causes a conflict
with Microsoft Mail.

RESOLUTION
==========

DCA has changed the way the keyboard is mapped in versions 3.0.1 and later of
the IRMA WorkStation, thus resolving this conflict. To correct the situation,
upgrade to DCA IRMA version 3.0.1 or later.

DCA's IRMA WorkStation for Mac is manufactured by a vendor independent of
