 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the MS-DOS 6.x REPLACE command with the /A switch and at least one
file exists in the destination directory that matches a file in the source
directory, REPLACE.EXE checks and copies only the first 255 pattern matches
(files) in the source directory.

To work around this problem, either use REPLACE without any switches, or use it
with the /U switch.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, and 6.22.
We will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
