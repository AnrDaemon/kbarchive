The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you you receive the following error message when booting your system with the
MS-DOS 6 Setup Disk 1, it is likely that you are using the Data Expert original
equipment manufacturer (OEM) version of MS-DOS 6:

   ERROR: D601US
   System failed

MORE INFORMATION
================

As an OEM, Data Expert exercised its right to change the method in which the
MS-DOS 6 operating system functions. Data Expert changed the boot functionality
so that Data Expert MS-DOS looks specifically for the Data Expert computer BIOS
signature. If its BIOS is not found, Data Expert MS-DOS refuses to boot.

If you boot from Data Expert MS-DOS 6 Setup Disk 1 on a system that uses a Data
Expert motherboard, you should not receive the error mentioned above.
