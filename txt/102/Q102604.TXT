The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows NT 3.1 does not support power management. If you are running
Windows NT on a machine with power management, you should disable these
features. Running Windows NT with power management features enabled can
lead to unexpected results.

The one exception to this is the Compaq LTE Lite line, which has not shown
serious problems during Windows NT testing. The one problem identified with
the LTE Lite line occurs when you press Standby: the system time stops.
