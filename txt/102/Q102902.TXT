The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1,3.5,3.51,4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1,3.5,3.51,4.0

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide 
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. 
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of 
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

With Windows NT on a Token Ring network, the Source Routing bit can be
modified to support bridging hardware that cannot forward frames with
routing information. To configure Windows NT so that only half of the
NetBEUI frames (NBF) include source routing information when they query a
remote server, use the following procedure.

Use the Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) to change the value for
QueryWithoutSourceRouting.

To modify the QueryWithoutSourceRouting value, use the following path
in the Registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NBF\Parameters

Change the value for QueryWithoutSourceRouting to 1.

Source Routing is offered in Token Ring networks only and allows NetBEUI
to be routed. Source Routing occurs when NetBEUI broadcasts a name query
frame on a local token ring; if it doesn't receive a response in a set
period of time, it enables Source Routing fields in the token ring frame
that will cause Source Routing Bridges to recognize the frame. The Source
Routing Bridges add additional routing information to the frame and send
it to all the other rings. When the frame reaches the desired host, the
host will use the routing information added to reply directly to the
originating node. The originating node then caches the routing information
returned by the remote host to address subsequent frames sent to the
remote hosts.
