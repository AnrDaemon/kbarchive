The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6

SUMMARY
=======

You can run dBASE IV reports without any modification by using the .FRG report
files generated by dBASE, as shown below.

In FoxPro version 2.6, the application used to convert dBASE .FRM files to .FRX
files is executed when you choose Migrate Files from the Run menu. The Catalog
Manager will convert the .FRM files automatically when these files are run or
modified.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In FoxPro for MS-DOS, you can run a dBASE .FRG report file with the REPORT FORM
command; for example, REPORT FORM <filename>.FRG. FoxPro compiles the .FRG
program into an .F4X file and runs the report.

In FoxPro for Windows, you must use the DO command instead. FoxPro compiles the
.FRG report into an .FXP file and runs the report. For example:

   USE <database name>
   LOCATE
   DO <report name>.FRG WITH .T.,.F.,.T.,"This is the heading"

NOTE: You must use the LOCATE command because there is a CONTINUE command in the
main DO WHILE loop generated by dBASE. The DO command parameters shown above
correspond to NOEJECT, PLAIN, SUMMARY, and an additional title line,
respectively.

NOTE: dBASE is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
