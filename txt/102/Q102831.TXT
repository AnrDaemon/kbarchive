SUMMARY
=======

In versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, when you
choose the Update button in the Gateway Connect Times screen, a mail message is
sent to Gateway Services (GWS). This message appears temporarily in the Outbound
Gateway Queue in the Mail Network Administrator program.

GWS reads this message and then deletes it. After reading the message, GWS
updates its gateway schedule times.

NOTE: Gateway Services is installed when MS Mail GW is loaded. The Outbound
Gateway Queue represents the inbox for GWS.
