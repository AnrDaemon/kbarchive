TITLE   :FIX: F2559, DX1020 From Illegal Array Bound, -4Yb, and -4Ys
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to compile an application may fail and Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation
may generate the following messages:

   error F2559: array bound used illegal variable
   DOSXNT : fatal error DX1020: unhandled exception:
   General protection fault

CAUSE
=====

The application declares an array using an initialized INTEGER variable as an
array bound and refers to that array using an INTEGER as a subscript. The
compile command line includes both the -4Yb and -4Ys option switches.

The General Protection Fault occurs because the array has an illegal array bound.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the source code to define the array bound in a PARAMETER statement before
using it in the array declaration or declare the array using an integer
constant.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0
for MS-DOS. This problem has been resolved with FORTRAN PowerStation maintenance
release version 1.0a for MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code example demonstrates this problem:

Sample Code 1
-------------

   C Compiler options needed: -4Yb -4Ys

         real x(n)
         i = 1
         x(i) = 1.0
         end

The following code example demonstrates the correct method to declare an array in
this manner:

Sample Code 2
-------------

   C Compiler options needed: -4Yb -4Ys

         parameter (n = 10)
         real x(n)
         i = 1
         x(i) = 1.0
         end

FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 can be differentiated from the maintenance
release version 1.0a by invoking the linker. Typing "link32 | more" (without the
quotation marks) from \F32\BIN directory will show version 2.8 for FORTRAN
PowerStation version 1.0, and it will show version 1.0f for the maintenance
release version 1.0a.
