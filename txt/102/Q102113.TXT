TITLE   :FIX: "Out of Virtual Memory" Message may be Caused by chdir()
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:1.00 2.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCRT kbVCkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an application that calls the chdir() function many times, an "Out
of Virtual Memory" error may occur. You may also notice that the page file grows
continuously as the application executes.

CAUSE
=====

The chdir() function allocates a small amount of memory each time it is called.
When the function successfully completes execution, it does not free the memory
and causes a small memory leak. Because no application accesses the memory, it
is eventually swapped into the page file. The "Out of Virtual Memory" error
occurs when the page file cannot grow any larger.

RESOLUTION
==========

An application developed for the Win32 or Win32s operating systems can avoid the
memory leak by using the SetCurrentDirectory() function. SetCurrentDirectory()
changes the current directory for the current process.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 2.1.
