The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In FoxPro for Windows, you can use FOXTOOLS.FLL with MAPI.DLL to invoke
Microsoft Mail version 3.0 so that you can send Mail messages while running your
FoxPro program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By using the RegFn() and CallFn() functions in FOXTOOLS.FLL to access the
MAPI.DLL from Mail 3.0, you can send attachments or messages from within a
FoxPro for Windows application.

The following sample code calls Microsoft Mail to bring up a Send Note dialog box
and attaches the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to the Mail message that is going to be
sent:

      SET LIBRARY TO SYS(2004) + "FOXTOOLS.FLL" ADDITIVE
      GetSysDir = RegFn("GetSystemDirectory","@CI","I")
      bigstr = REPLICATE(chr(0),144) &&creates a big string
      retlen = CallFn(GetSysDir, @bigstr,144)
      winsys = LEFT(bigstr,retlen)
      SendMail=RegFn("MAPISendDocuments","L@C@C@CL", ;
         "L", winsys+"\MAPI.DLL")
      T1=";"
      T2="C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT"
      T3=""
      X=CallFn(SendMail,0,@T1,@T2,@T3,0)
      RELEASE LIBRARY SYS(2004) + "FOXTOOLS.FLL"

GetSystemDirectory() is a Microsoft Windows application programming interface
(API) function used to retrieve the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. RegFn() returns
a function handle to GetSysDir so that the handle can be accessed by CallFn().
CallFn() is used to determine the length of GetSysDir and assigns the numeric
value to retlen. It also puts the string value of GetSysDir in the variable
bigstr. At this point, the location of the MAPI.DLL file is known, and the
MAPISendDocuments() function is used to send a standard Microsoft Mail message.

Now that MAPISendDocuments() has been registered, the SendMail variable can be
used to start Mail. T1 refers to the delimiter between filenames. T2 is the list
of files that you would like to send. T3 is a null character and is not
necessary for this program. Therefore, if you want to send both the AUTOEXEC.BAT
and CONFIG.SYS files in your Mail message, you would use
T2="C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT;C:\CONFIG.SYS". For more information on the
MAPISendDocuments() function, see the Microsoft Mail "Technical Reference"
manual.
