TITLE   :BUG: CXX0030 Error Using Enumerated Type in Class
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::4.0,4.01,4.05,4.1; WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.05, 4.1 
 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual Workbench for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to display a variable in the Locals, QuickWatch, or Watch windows
fails and CodeView or Visual Workbench displays the following message:

   CXX0030 : Error : expression cannot be evaluated

CAUSE
=====

The application uses a type-defined enumerated bitfield in a class type and the
user attempts to display the value of a variable of that type. The CXX0030 error
may not occur if you do not attempt to display it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in CodeView versions 4.0x and 4.1
for MS-DOS and Windows and in Visual Workbench version 1.0 for Windows.

This is not a problem in CodeView version 4.25 for Win32s.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code example demonstrates this problem.

Sample Code
-----------

   /*
    * Compiler options needed: /Zi /Od /f-
    */ 

   #include <iostream.h>
   typedef enum
   {
      T1
   } TENUM;

   class TEST
   {
   public:
      TEST();
      TENUM linkstate:8;
   };

   TEST::TEST()
   {
      linkstate = T1;
   }

   TEST *port;
   void main(void)
   {
      port = new TEST;
      // NOTE: Must refer to linkstate for CXX0033 error to occur.
      port->linkstate;
      delete port;
   }
