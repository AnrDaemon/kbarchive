SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, if you use the
External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) with the -Q1 command-line option, External
displays two identical messages for each postoffice when it processes mail. The
messages appear as follows:

   Delivering new mail to NETWORK/POSTOFFICE

The double message is given because External is attempting to deliver mail from
the INQUEUE.MBG and INQUEUE3.MBG files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post
