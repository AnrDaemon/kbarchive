The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Here is a list of the system requirements for versions 2.1, 3.0, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400:

 - The number of file handles must be set to a minimum of 30. (In the CONFIG.SYS
   file, set files=30.)

 - You must have 430K of available conventional RAM.

 - You must have at least 5 MB of free disk space. When the Microsoft Mail
   Gateway to X.400 sends an X.400 message, it makes a temporary copy of that
   message on the computer that is running the Gateway (or wherever the TEMP
   environment variable points to).

   The mail/gateway administrator should try to anticipate a user's largest
   message and make sure slightly more free disk space is available.
