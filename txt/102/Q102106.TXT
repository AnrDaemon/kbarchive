The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The IBM VM operating environment allows you to send individual files
from one VM ID to other VM IDs on the same node or on other connected
VM nodes, through the use of the IBM SENDFILE command.

With version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS, VM users can send
individual files and information to users on a Microsoft Mail postoffice
using the same SENDFILE command.

To send information to Microsoft Mail users, use this format for the
SENDFILE command:

   sendfile <filename> <filetype> <filemode> to
   <username> at <gtwynode>

 
You can also send files by using the IBM SPOOL and PUNCH commands.
