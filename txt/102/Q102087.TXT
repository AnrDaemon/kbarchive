TITLE   :Mac Bkup: Backup Status Message Could Not Be Sent
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After backing up a version 3.1 Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks Mail Data
file, the Mail Backup utility may display the following message:

   Your Microsoft Mail Datafile was backed up successfully. However, a status
   message explaining this could not be sent.

CAUSE
=====

This message may appear for either of the following reasons:

1. The user name specified in the Send Status To field of the Backup utility
   dialog box is incorrectly defined or does not exist.

2. The Mail server for the specified user name is unavailable.

This error often occurs when multiple mail servers are scheduled for backup at
the same time, with multiple backup messages addressed to the same user.
Additionally, it may occur if you are sending the status message to the Network
Manager account in a multi-server environment.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do one of the following (corresponding to the causes
listed above):

1. In the Mail Backup utility dialog box, enter a user's name in the following
   format:

   " USER@MAILSERVER " (without the quotation marks)

   where USER matches exactly the user'[ASCII 146]s sign-in name and MAILSERVER
   matches exactly the name of the server as specified in the Server Settings
   dialog box.

2. Stagger the times of the scheduled backups to make sure that the mail server
   receiving the backup messages is operating when the other servers complete
   their backup cycles.
