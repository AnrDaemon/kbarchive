SUMMARY
=======

The following code example demonstrates one method of replacing a character
field with a numeric selection from a popup. Occasionally, you may need to store
a character string choice made from a popup to a character field.

Normally, a popup must be assigned to a numeric database field and as a result,
the numeric value indicating which bar of the popup was selected is placed in
the database. This example actually places the character selection string in a
character field of the database.
