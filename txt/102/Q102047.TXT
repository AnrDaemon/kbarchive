KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Closing a Visual FoxPro Query Designer or a FoxPro 2.x RQBE query with no fields
selected for output will generate a two-part error:

1. A window will open showing the SELECT statement with an "SQL Invalid SELECT"
   message.

2. A dialog box will warn you about not being able to reopen the query and then
   asks if you want to continue.

CAUSE
=====

A SELECT statement with no fields selected cannot be closed because it is not a
valid SQL statement--FoxPro checks to see if it is a valid SQL statement before
bringing up the Save dialog box. The Query Designer and RQBE depend on being
able to compile the SQL statement when they open a .QPR file. Therefore, FoxPro
will not save an invalid, uncompilable statement by bringing up the Save dialog
box when the close box is used.

RESOLUTION
==========

To save an SQL statement that has no selected fields, choose Save or Save As
from the File menu. This method works because FoxPro does not check the SQL
statement to make sure it is valid first. However, when you attempt to open the
*.QPR file, the following error message appears:

   Unrecognized command verb.- CANCEL, SUSPEND, IGNORE.

If you attempt to run the invalid *.QPR file by choosing Query from the Run menu,
the following error messages appear:

   Could not execute query.
   Unrecognized command verb.
