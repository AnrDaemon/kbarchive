TITLE   :NetWkstaGetInfo Documented Incorrectly in Programmer's Ref

======================================================================
The LAN Manager API NetWkstaGetInfo is documented incorrectly on
pages 661 and 665 of the "LAN Manager Programmer's Reference."

The documentation for NetWkstaGetInfo states that the return
parameter wkiX_logon_server (X = 0 or 1) is not supported for MS-DOS
workstations, when in fact it is supported for enhanced workstations.

It does not, however, function correctly under Windows for Workgroups
using either real mode or the virtual redirector. Both of these
redirectors return a NULL for the wkiX_logon_server (X = 0 or 1). The
NULL indicates that the user was not validated by a server. This is
expected, because the WfW logon validation is performed through the
password list on the local machine. The option to logon to a LAN
Manager server does not make a difference.

Additional query words: wfw wfwg 2.10 2.1 2.10a 2.1a 2.20 2.2 api
