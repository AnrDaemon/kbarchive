SUMMARY
=======

When you are using the Form Designer, you can create a custom form with a
default recipient, similar to the Inquiry form. The Inquiry form is shipped with
the Mail server and always gets sent to the Network Manager.

The following are the steps to create a custom form with a default recipient:

1. Choose the Field tool and double-click the User List field.

2. Make sure the Lock Text check box is clear (not selected) and choose OK.

3. Choose the Browse tool and type the default recipient's name into the User
   List. If there are multiple users with that name (for example, Network
   Manager or Jane Smith), use the recipient name and the server name, as in the
   following:

   " Network Manager@Accounting Server " (without the quotation marks)

4. Repeat steps 1 and 2, this time making sure the Lock Text check box is
   selected.

5. Recompile and install.

TIP: If you want to hide the User List, bring up the message box (COMMAND+M) and
type the following:

   " hide card field "user list" " (without the quotation marks)

If the field is not locked, or if the name is not unique, the Send button will be
unavailable (gray) after the form is installed until a valid address is added to
the recipient list. The Inquiry stack is not a good example for this because it
uses a different method to pre-addressing messages.
