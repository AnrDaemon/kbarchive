TITLE   :WRKHEURISTICS Bit 14 Controls Raw I/O for LM MS-DOS Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
Bit 14 in WRKHEURISTICS on LAN Manager MS-DOS clients controls raw
server message block (SMB) data transfers: 0 = raw I/O enabled.
Whether or not you set this bit depends on your system communications
lines and your performance criteria. On noisy lines, raw I/O can
significantly reduce retries; on clean lines it significantly reduces
performance. To reduce the number of calls, bit 14 is commonly set to
1 (raw I/O disabled).

Additional query words: 2.00 2.0 2.10 2.1 2.10a 2.1a 2.20 2.2
