The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0

Customers that have installed the Services for Macintosh and have not
yet upgraded their partitions to NTFS will not have the Microsoft User
Authentication Module (UAM) volume. This article explains how to set
up that volume after a NTFS partition has been created.

The Microsoft UAM volume is formed with the following files:

 - MS UAM

 - ReadMe.UAM

To create this volume and put the correct files in it, do the
following:

1. Make sure that you have an NTFS partition.

2. If you are running Windows NT 3.x, run the following command from a command
   prompt:

   SETUP /i OEMNXPSM.INF /c UAMINSTALL

   If you are running Windows NT 4.0, run the following command from a command
   prompt:

   SETUP /i OEMNSVSM.INF /c UAMINSTALL

   The OEMNXPSM.INF and OEMNSVSM.INF files are the script information files for
   the Services for Macintosh, and UAMINSTALL is the name of the section that
   has the necessary commands to modify the registry in order to add that
   volume.

3. The Windows NT Setup screen appears and returns to the command prompt if the
   above step was successful.

   There are two things happening at this point. One is the creation of the
   volume itself, and the other is the copying and creation of the files. The
   SMFUAM.IFO and the SMFUAM.RSC are the two forks for the MS UAM file, and the
   SFMUAM.TXT is the ReadMe.UAM file. These files get stored within a
   subdirectory called AppleShare Folder, which is also created by this script
   file.

4. Because the script file modifies the registry, you will not see the volume if
   you have the File Services for Macintosh started. If this is the case, stop
   and start the File Services for Macintosh.

5. Check the newly created volume in File Manager, Server Manager or the MacFile
   icon in the Control Panel.
