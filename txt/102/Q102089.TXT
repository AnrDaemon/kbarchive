SUMMARY
=======

A message that is created with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows
gets reformatted for transmission and storage. Normally, the message has an 80
character column width. This is a normal feature for Microsoft Mail for
Windows.

NOTE: When viewed by the Microsoft Mail Remote for MS-DOS Remote client, it has
the 70 column width formatting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the messages is transferred from the Windows mail message file (MMF) to the
temporary storage used by Mail Remote for Windows, it gets reformatted. The
original message is set to an 80 character column width, but the message that is
sent has a 70 character column width.

When the message is transferred back into the MMF Outbox, it is correctly
reformatted.

This is simply a design feature of Mail for Windows.
