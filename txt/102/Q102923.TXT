SUMMARY
=======

According to STB Systems, Inc., the STB WIND/X video card may conflict with the
address of the COM4 serial port (2E8h). This article contains an excerpt from
the "WIND/X Video Card" user's manual that describes the problem and
workarounds.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following text is from page 1-4 of the STB "WIND/X Video Card" user's
manual:

   The WIND/X graphics controller chip uses the hex port address 46E8 for one of
   its extended register sets. When only the first 8 bits of this 16 bit address
   are decoded in any operation, the address appears as hex port address 2E8,
   which is a popular hex port address for a COM 4 serial port. This may result
   in an address conflict and prevent COM 4 from functioning or cause it to
   operate in an unpredictable manner. (e.g., Windows losing text, COM 4 locking
   up)

   If you have a COM 4, or any other device in your system that you suspect uses
   the 2E8h address, consult the device documentation for alternate address
   selection/configuration.
