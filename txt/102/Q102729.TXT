The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

Customers may want to use Windows NT Services for Macintosh to share
information on CD-ROM with Macintosh clients. This is not possible with
Microsoft LAN Manager Services for Macintosh.

Windows NT Server and Advanced Server use the Windows NT file system (NTFS)
to store a file's resource fork and permissions in the space dedicated to
the extended attributes.

However, the CD file system (CDFS) volumes are read-only medium; therefore,
the permissions are defaulted to Read access.

Services for Macintosh allows Macintoshes to utilize PC-compatible CDs in
drives attached to the server. It does NOT allow Macintosh-compatible CDs
to be read or shared by a Windows NT Server or Advanced Server.

To create a Macintosh volume on CD-ROM, do the following:

1. From the File Manager, select the directory on the CD that you want to
   designate as a Macintosh-accessible volume.

2. From the MacFile menu, choose Create Volume.

3. In the Volume Name box, type a volume name that Macintosh users will see when
   they log on.

4. Specify a new path and password, if necessary. The security defaults to
   read-only because of the nature of CDFS.

5. Choose the OK button.
