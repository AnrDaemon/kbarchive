TITLE   :Disabled Servers Not Dimmed in Server Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an Advanced Server (controller or server) is turned off or down, Server
Manager will not dim (gray out) the entry. Refreshing or reloading Server
Manager will not correct this problem.

CAUSE
=====

Server Manager relies on the Browser service for its information on the status
of workstations and servers. The Browser service may take up to 52 minutes to
refresh its list.

RESOLUTION
==========

Type NET VIEW \\<servername>, which calls the server directly, giving you
the immediate status of the server.

NOTE: The Domain Monitor utility, DOMMON.EXE, in the Windows NT Resource Kit
accurately shows the status of the servers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
