TITLE   :OS/2 Postscript Driver Traps After About 1600 Print Jobs
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

Print Manager generates a ring 2 trap in the OS/2 Postscript driver after
printing approximately 1600 print jobs. The CSLIM and IP of the trap screen
match these values:

AX=FFFF BX=0008 CX=0000 DX=FFFF BP=0f6c
SI=31F4 DI=2ccc DS=200E ES=1ff7 FLG=2246
CS=1FB6 IP=7242 SS=0486 SP=0f2c MSW=001b
CSLIM=d720 SSLIM=0fff DSLIM=470f ESLIM=fffb
CSACC=DB SSACC=D3 DSACC=d3 ESACC=F3
ERRCD=FFFC ERLIM=**** ERACC=**

You are able to end Print Manager, although restarting it without rebooting is
not recommended.

CAUSE
=====

The OS/2 Postscript driver (PSCRIPT.DRV) allocates a small piece of memory from
its local heap with each print job. This error was caused when the driver failed
to release local heap memory when the job was complete. Eventually the local
heap would reach its 64-K maximum and subsequent attempts to allocate memory
would fail.

WORKAROUND
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in LAN Manager version 2.2. This
problem was corrected in the LAN Manager 2.2b Patch. Contact Microsoft PSS for
the patch.
