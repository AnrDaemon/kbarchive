TITLE   :Bringing Up a Windows NT Advanced Server in a TCP/IP WAN
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you bring up a Windows NT Server as a "Server", the Windows NT Server
communicates with the domain controller and checks for access permissions
and so on. When the domain spans over a wide area network (WAN) and the
domain controller is located across a router that is routing IP only, you
should perform the following procedure to bring up a server in the domain.

These steps will allow the Windows NT Server to resolve the name of the
domain controller and communicate with it for authentication and
participation in the domain:

1. Prepare an LMHOSTS file on another machine. The LMHOSTS file should contain
   the following information:

      IP Address of DC    NetBIOS name of DC     #PRE #DOM:Domain name

   For example:

      130.20.7.80         DOMCTRLR               #PRE #DOM:MYDOMAIN

2. Copy the LMHOSTS file to a floppy disk so that it can later be imported by
   the domain controller.

3. When you are installing the Server, select the Custom Install option to
   install the Advanced Server.

4. During a network installation, make sure you select TCP/IP Protocol to be
   installed. This step is important; otherwise, only NetBEUI will be installed,
   and the Windows NT Server is not able to communicate with the domain
   controller.

5. After TCP/IP is installed, choose OK. The TCP/IP settings menu will be
   displayed. After entering the IP address and other TCP/IP- related
   information, choose the IMPORT LMHOSTS File button.

6. Place the floppy disk containing the new LMHOSTS file in the floppy disk
   drive and specify the path for the LMHOSTS file in the IMPORT LMHOSTS File
   dialog box. Note that you need only specify the path, not the name of the
   file. For example, if the LMHOSTS file is located in the root directory of
   the floppy disk and the disk is in drive A, you need only specify "A:\" in
   the dialog box. Also note that the file must be named "LMHOSTS".

7. Follow the instructions and answer the installation questions.
