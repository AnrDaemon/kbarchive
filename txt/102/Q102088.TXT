KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.1, 3.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.1 and 3.1a of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, it is
possible for the Read button to not be displayed on the screen. Messages can
still be read by double-clicking the message or by highlighting the message and
then pressing the RETURN key on the keyboard.

CAUSE
=====

Version 3.1 of Mail is the first version to have a resizable message summary
screen. If the size of the summary screen has been reduced and any portion of
the window pane covers the Read button, it will not be displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To allow the button to be displayed, increase the size of the window. Once the
window is large enough, the button reappears.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The resizable message summary screen will also be available to users who are
utilizing the 3.0 version of the workstation if the server has been upgraded to
version 3.1. Therefore, it is possible for this scenario to occur with a 3.0
client.
