SUMMARY
=======

If you have more than one user or logon name on a machine running Windows for
Workgroups version 3.1 and you want to remove a user name, you can do so by
modifying the SYSTEM.INI file and removing the user's password list (.PWL) file
from the Windows directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following procedure to remove a user name:

1. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file using an ASCII text editor (such as the MS-DOS
   EDIT.COM). This can be done by typing the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt:

   edit c:\windows\system.ini

2. In the [PASSWORD LISTS] section, delete the line that pertains to the user
   name you want to remove, making note of the file to which that line makes
   reference.

3. Delete the file referenced in the SYSTEM.INI from the proper directory. This
   is the user's password list file.

The user name should no longer appear for that machine.
