TITLE   :FIX: App Studio Changes Control ID to Dialog Box ID
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbResourceEd kbVC kbGrpDSToolskbbuglist

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The App Studio, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, version 1.0 
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use App Studio to edit a dialog box created in App Wizard, the first
control created may have the same ID as the dialog box. In other words, if the
dialog box ID is "IDD_DIALOG1," the identifier for the first control may also
appear as "IDD_DIALOG1."

CAUSE
=====

App Wizard creates the dialog box ID and control ID with the same numeric value
even though the symbols are different. When App Studio loads the resource file
and looks for a symbol that matches the control ID, it does not exclude the
dialog box ID from its search.

RESOLUTION
==========

Because the dialog box ID and control ID have the same numeric value, this
behavior should not affect your application. However, you can eliminate this
behavior by editing the RESOURCE.H file to change the value of
_APS_NEXT_CONTROL_VALUE from 101 to 1001 before you start App Studio.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the beginning
of this article. This was fixed in Microsoft Visual C++ version 1.5 C++ for
Windows, and Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Perform the following nine steps to demonstrate this problem:

1. Create a new project with App Wizard.

2. Start App Studio.

3. Create a new dialog box.

4. Add an EditBox control to the dialog box.

5. Double-click the EditBox and note that its ID is IDC_EDIT1.

6. Choose Save All from the File menu, then exit App Studio.

7. Restart App Studio.

8. Open the previously-created dialog box.

9. Double-click the same EditBox; its ID now shows as IDD_DIALOG1.
