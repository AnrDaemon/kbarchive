TITLE   :Can't Remove Network Components and Reinstall Advanced Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Removing all software components and all network adapters, then trying to
reinstall them when Windows NT comes back up does not work. While reinstalling
network software, you must specify the domain's name and then reboot. When you
try to log back on, you get a message that says: "The system cannot log you on
(C00000DF). Please try again or consult your system administrator."

CAUSE
=====

Installing an Advanced Server requires creating a new security database;
however, for security reasons, you can't do this on a system that already has a
security database--essentially any machine that has already been installed. This
is the same reason you can't move an Advanced Server from one domain to another
without completely reinstalling.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no valid reason to remove all network components and then try to
reinstall an Advanced Server, so the process is not supported in version 3.1.
Instead, you should save your security database then do a complete reinstall.
Future versions may prevent removal of the workstation or server components on
Advanced Servers because these components are required for proper operation.
