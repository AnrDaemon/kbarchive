SUMMARY
=======

You can display running totals from database fields, or running totals for a
particular control break, by using calculated fields in a BROWSE command.

The following example uses the CUSTOMER database and displays the running total
of year-to-date purchases (YTDPURCH field) using the file and field names in
FoxPro 2.x:

      SELECT 0
      USE CUSTOMER
      BROWSE FIELDS CNO, YTDPURCH, RUNNINGYTD=RUNNINGSUM()
    
      PROCEDURE RUNNINGSUM
      m.saverec = RECNO()
      GO TOP
      SUM YTDPURCH WHILE RECNO() <= m.saverec TO m.total
      GO m.saverec
      RETURN m.total

The same concept can also be applied to display running totals for a particular
control break. For example, if we wanted to calculate the running total of
year-to-date purchases by company number (CNO), and have an index tag on CNO,
the following code could be used:

      SELECT 0
      USE CUSTOMER
      SET ORDER TO TAG CNO
      BROWSE FIELDS CNO, YTDPURCH, RUNNINGSUM = CNOTOT(CNO)
    
      FUNCTION CNOTOT
      PARAMETERS mkey
      m.saverec = RECNO()
      SEEK mkey
      SUM YTDPURCH WHILE CNO=mkey .AND. RECNO()<=m.saverec to m.total
      GO m.saverec
      RETURN m.total
