======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.1a, 3.1c, 3.1d 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using mail-enabled applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel
on a workstation that has Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks and CE
Software's QuickMail installed, QuickMail is displayed, rather than Microsoft
Mail.

CAUSE
=====

CE has written the QuickMail application to activate before Microsoft Mail.
Therefore, if you have both Microsoft Mail and QuickMail installed on your
system, the QuickMail program will activate before Microsoft Mail.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no known workaround to this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with CE Software's QuickMail. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The product included here, CE Software's QuickMail, is manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
