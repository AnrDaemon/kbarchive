SUMMARY
=======

The following changes have been made from the Windows 3.1 version of DDEML to
the version that shipped with Windows for Workgroups (WFW) version 3.1:

 - The default shutdown timeout was changed from 3,000 milliseconds to 30,000
   milliseconds.

 - DdeQueryConvInfo() added support for the new hwnd and hwndPartner fields.

 - DdeQueryConvInfo() added more robust handling for improper setting of the
   CONVINFO structure's cb field when called.

 - Rewrote DdePostAdvise() to supply the correct count of remaining transactions
   to be processed on the same topic!item!format name set for the XTYP_ADVREQ
   transaction.

 - Disallow synchronous calls if the application is shutting down, or if already
   in the middle of a synchronous transaction.

 - DdeUninitialize() was fixed to defer processing if called while in the middle
   of a synchronous transaction.

 - DdeUninitialize() was fixed to dispatch any pending DDE messages and to make
   necessary callbacks before quitting.

 - Added call to DdeUninitialize() from within DdeClientTransaction() when in
   the middle of a synchronous transaction and DdeUninitialize() had been
   called.

 - Allow any instance to call DdeCreateStringHandle().

 - Have DdeAbandonTransaction() only mark abandoned transactions, rather than
   trying to remove the transaction from internal structures.

 - Alter PostMessage() overflow queuing to queue based on target instead of on
   the same task, so that one target queue overflow does not bog down all
   PostMessage() calls.
