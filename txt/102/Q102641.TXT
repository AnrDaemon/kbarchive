SUMMARY
=======

For an edit control, the EM_SETSEL documentation states that wParam is a flag
for specifying whether to scroll the caret into view. When the parameter is
zero, the caret is scrolled into view. When the parameter is one (1), the caret
is not scrolled into view. This is only valid for a multiline edit control. For
a single line edit control, the wParam flag is not used.
