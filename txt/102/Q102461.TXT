SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing the BROWSE KEY 0 command when no order is set in the database causes an
uninterruptible "Record Out of Range" error in releases of FoxPro version 2.0
for MS-DOS dated earlier than March 25, 1992. In FoxPro versions 2.5 and 2.5a
for MS-DOS and in FoxPro versions 2.5 and 2.5a for Windows, an unrecoverable
error of "Index Does Not Match Table Recreate Index" error occurs. The only way
to exit from this error is to reboot your computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.
