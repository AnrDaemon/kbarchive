KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 may give this error on an
outbound connection:

   ERROR 3 (layer): Open failed.

The gateway failed to initialize the protocol stack for an outgoing call. An
earlier message may indicate the problem.

CAUSE
=====

This error may occur during an attempt to connect to a remote message transfer
agent (MTA). Some possible reasons for this error are:

 - The remote MTA is busy and is not accepting any calls.

 - An incorrect X.25 number is specified for the remote MTA.

 - An incorrect X.25 user data field is specified for the remote MTA.

 - An invalid X.25 facility is specified for the remote MTA.

 - There are not enough logical sessions between the MTA and the EiconCard. The
   number of logical sessions between the MTA and the EiconCard is determined by
   the n parameter specified in the following command:

   nabios rdr <computername> /n

   To determine if there are enough logical sessions available, run the ECSTATUS
   program on the computer with the EiconCard.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check whether the TP4 or the X.25 drivers are loaded. For X.25, also check
whether the EiconCard server machine is running.
