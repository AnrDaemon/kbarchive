To get the TCP, IP, ICMP, and UDP counters to appear in the
Performance Monitor utility (PERFMON.EXE), you must install and start
the \WINNT\SYSTEM32\SNMP.EXE service.

This service is not installed by default when you install TCPIP. To
install the service, choose the Network icon in Control Panel.

--------------

- Select Add Software button

- Select SNMP Service, and then choose the Continue button.

When you exit the Network settings dialog box, it asks you to shut
down the system. This is not necessary, simply use the NET START SNMP
command at the command line.

These counters are also installed by the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit.
