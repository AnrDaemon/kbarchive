TITLE   :Using CHKSTOR for Disk Quota Reporting in LAN Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
In LAN Manager, you can use the CHKSTOR utility to gather
information on disk quotas.

Before running CHKSTOR for quota information, you must first specify a
directory (in the user account "Home directory" field). If you
indicate it with a uniform naming convention name, it can be a
directory that exists on another server. You can then specify a disk
space amount (in kilobytes) in the user account "User storage limit"
field.

To determine when "Home directory" exceeds the "User storage
limit," run the CHKSTOR utility.

CHKSTOR compares the "User storage limit" to the actual number of
bytes currently stored in the "Home directory" and all of its
subdirectories. If this number exceeds "User storage limit,"
CHKSTOR reports (to the screen unless redirected to a filename) the
username, disk space allowed, disk space used, and home directory
path. CHKSTOR also sends an alert message (unless you suppress this
feature) to the names on the ALERTNAMES line of LANMAN.INI each
time it finds the disk-space-use limit being exceeded.
