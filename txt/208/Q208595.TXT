SYMPTOMS
========

With a Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic (VBCE) project open in the Visual
Basic design environment, resetting the toolbars causes an Application Error
when exiting Visual Basic. The following error message is received:

   VB6.EXE - Application Error
   The instruction at "0x10009bac" referenced memory at "0x03466020".
   The memory could not be "read".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Do not reset the toolbars while editing a Visual Basic CE project. This clears
the menus as customized by the Visual Basic CE Add-In, causing an Application
Error when you shut down Visual Basic.
