TITLE   :SMS: CAP Not Accessible During SMS 2.0 Client Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbClient kbsms200 kbCAP

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During a Systems Management Server 2.0 client installation, the Ccim32.log might
indicate that the client access point (CAP) is not accessible. You may see an
entry similar to the following in the CCIM32 log:

   WaitForCAPAccess - abstract export ABEXPRT:\\CAP List for site ABC not
   accessible

Enabling network abstraction layer (NAL) logging will provide more detail. The
Ccim32.log will have an entry similar to the following:

   NAL[4] - ERROR: failed to make the network connection. No more connections
   can be made to this remote computer at this time

For more information about enabling NAL logging see the Systems Management Server
Resource Guide.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the client is unable to connect to the CAP because
there are no more licenses available for the Windows NT server. This usually
occurs with "Per Server" licensing. Each Systems Management Server client
installation may use several licenses as connections to the CAP server are made
under multiple user contexts.

Note that this is just one of many causes that may cause a client not to be able
to connect to a CAP.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you must change your licenses from "per server" to
"per seat," or purchase more licenses.
