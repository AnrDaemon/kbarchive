PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0

KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the AT command to schedule a task to occur on Sunday, the list of
scheduled tasks may display the letter "S" for Saturday instead of "Su" for
Sunday.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Task Scheduler tool has replaced the Windows NT
Schedule service.

RESOLUTION
==========

To view scheduled tasks correctly, double-click My Computer, and then
double-click Scheduled Tasks.

To restore the expected behavior of the AT command, uninstall Task Scheduler:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Add/Remove Programs.

2. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Task Scheduler 1.0 (Remove Only), click
   Add/Remove, click Yes when you are prompted to remove Task Scheduler, and
   then click Yes when you are prompted to restart your computer.
