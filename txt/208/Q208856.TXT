The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Usually when you move the mouse over a rectangle or ellipse which is inserted
into the BLOCKS32 sample, it shows different cursors depending on the position
of mouse.

However, if you compile the BLOCKS32 sample with Use MFC in a Static Library
option, the different cursors do not appear when moving the mouse over a
rectangle or ellipse.

CAUSE
=====

When an application is linked to MFC using the static library, the MFC resources
are compiled into an application's executable. The application's executable will
include the Afxres.rc file. You can check this by selecting the View menu and
Resource Includes menu. The Afxres.rc file has the resources that CRectTracker
uses in the MFC source code.

These resources are included only when _AFX_NO_TRACKER_RESOURCES is not defined.
The BLOCKS32 project has _AFX_NO_TRACKER_RESOURCES defined, so it does not place
the resources that CRectTracker needs into the application's executable image.
Therefore, none of the cursors used by CRectTracker will show up when building
the sample using MFC statically.

RESOLUTION
==========

Select the View menu and Resource Includes menu item and delete the following
line:

      #define _AFX_NO_TRACKER_RESOURCES 

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

 Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Extract Blocks32.exe sample from Microsoft Developer's Network (MSDN)

2. From the Project menu select Settings

3. Change "Use MFC in a Shared DLL" to "Use MFC in a Static Library"

4. Build the application and run it

5. From the New menu select Rectangle.

6. Move the cursor into the rectangle and cursor disappears.

View the Afxres.rc file as a text file and you can see that CRectTracker
resources are included only when _AFX_NO_TRACKER_RESOURCES is not defined.
