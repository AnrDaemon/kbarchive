TITLE   :FP: WMF Files Display Larger Than Expected
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 2002 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 2000 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a Windows Metafile Format (WMF) image, the image appears larger
than expected.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if you are using older WMF files. Clip art in Microsoft
Office 2000, Microsoft FrontPage 2000, Microsoft Office XP, and Microsoft
FrontPage 2002 use an updated file format.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, resize the image. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Position your mouse pointer over a corner of the image.

2. When the pointer changes to a two-headed arrow pointer, hold down the left
   mouse button, and drag the mouse pointer toward the center of the image.

3. When the image is the size you want, release the mouse button.

4. Save the page and image.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
