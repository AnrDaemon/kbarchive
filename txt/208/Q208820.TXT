TITLE   :Print Monitor Does Not Support Bidirectional Printing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Hewlett-Packard (HP) 4000 printer driver on a computer
running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, print jobs may not be printed, or may persist
in the print queue for an extended period of time before being printed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by a conflict between the printer driver and print
monitor status software. HP printer drivers enable bidirectional print support
by default, but the Hpdcmon.dll file that provides print monitor status does not
support bidirectional printing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this issue from occurring, disable the bidirectional printing support
for each HP printer driver installed:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Printers, right-click the icon
   representing the printer to be modified, and then click Properties.

2. Click Ports, click to clear the Enable Bidirectional Support check box, and
   then click OK.
