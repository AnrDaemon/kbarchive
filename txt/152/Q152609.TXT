TITLE   :PRB: Visual Basic Program Does Not Run on Other Computers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Visual Basic program runs properly on the development computer. The executable
file, along with the associated control (.OCX) and .DLL files, are copied to
another computer. Attempting to run the program on the other computer results in
the error 424 with the following message:

   You do not have an appropriate license to use functionality.

CAUSE
=====

 - The controls or DLLs used by the program were not registered in the system
   registry of the other computer.

 - Some controls used by the program require dependency files that need to be
   installed and registered in the other computer.

 - Some files, such as those for JET, are required to be in specific
   directories.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the Setup Wizard in Visual Basic to create an installation program that
copies all the required files to the correct locations and makes the proper
registry modifications. To install the program into another computer, use the
installation program and the compressed files developed using Setup Wizard to
properly install the program.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual Basic version 4.0 uses substantially more OLE components than version
3.0. These components have dependency files and require system registry
modifications. Even if another setup program is used, Setup Wizard should be run
on your application to allow the Wizard to determine all the necessary files
needed by your program.

To reduce the number of required program files, remove unneeded controls from the
project in the Custom Controls dialog box by following the steps below:

1. From the Tools menu, click Custom Controls, or press CTRL+T to display the
   Custom Controls dialog box.

2. In the Custom Controls dialog box, clear the checkboxes of the unneeded
   controls. Click OK to close this dialog box.

3. From the Tools menu, click References to display the References dialog box.
   Clear the checkboxes of the unneeded controls. Click OK to close this dialog
   box.
