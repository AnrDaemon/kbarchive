TITLE   :XCLN: MAPIOle Attachments from OLEMsg have no Rendering Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the MAPIOle type of attachment in OLEMsg, the message will be
missing the rendering data for the OLE object. For example, when the message is
opened in the Microsoft Exchange client, nothing is displayed for the object
unless you click the place where the object is supposed to be.

CAUSE
=====

The OLE object is displayed too small to be legible and appears completely
blank.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the Microsoft Exchange client's Object command on the Insert Menu to insert
the object.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
