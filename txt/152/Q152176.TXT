Explorapedia: The World of Nature and Explorapedia: The World of People use

play compressed sound files.

Explorapedia uses the following decompression Codecs to play certain kinds of
sound:

   Microsoft ADPCM
   Microsoft PCM Converter

The Explorapedia series programs use the following Codecs to play the sounds in
the contexts indicated.

Microsoft ADPCM:
----------------

Microsoft PCM Converter:
