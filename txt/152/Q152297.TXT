TITLE   :PRB: Calling APRINTERS Function Causes Feature Not Available
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a program calls the APRINTERS() function to place the names of printers
currently installed into a memory variable array, Visual FoxPro generates the
error number 1001 "Feature not Available."

CAUSE
=====

This function is supported on the Windows platform only. The APRINTERS()
function makes a call to the operating system to return the information about
mounted printers. The Macintosh operating system does not provide this
information. Thus, the APRINTERS function is not available in Visual FoxPro for
Macintosh.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are writing a cross-platform application, you can build a conditional
structure that only includes calls to the APRINTERS function if you are running
on the Windows platform.

For example:

      DO CASE
       CASE _WINDOWS
        <include your commands here>

       CASE _MAC
         <get information about the current printer>

      ENDCASE
