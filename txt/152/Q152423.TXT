TITLE   :Pcmsvc32.exe Does Not Check \MSTEST Directory for Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbusage kbPCM smsgeneral smspcm kbArtTypeINFkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When sending out a package that requires using an executable file from the
\Mstest directory on the logon server, Pcmsvc32.exe will fail to find the
executable file and thus the job will fail on the client. Because the job is
being run in background mode no error message will show on the client.

For example, if an MSTEST script is sent out in a package Pcmsvc32.exe will not
check the \Mstest directory on the logon server for Mtrun.exe.

CAUSE
=====

Pcmsvc32.exe does not look in the \Mstest directory for any executables or
associated DLLs. Pcmsvc32.exe will only look in the package source for any
required executable files and DLLs.

WORKAROUND
==========

Send the required executable files in the package.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Systems Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
