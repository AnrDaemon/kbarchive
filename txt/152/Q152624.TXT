PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,4.5,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following Event IDs are logged in the Windows NT Event Viewer application
log if the account listed on the Override tab of the Site Connector in the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program does not have Service Account Admin
rights on the Configuration and Site containers.

Note: This behavior can also occur by having the wrong password in the startup
parameters for the message transfer agent (MTA) service.

   Application log:

   Event id: 9297 Source = MS Exchange MTA
   The user /o=ORGanization /ou=SITE1 /cn=Configuration /cn=Servers /cn=SERVER1
   /cn=Microsoft Private MDB has caused a security violation. Locality table
   (LTAB) index: 5. Windows NT error code: 0. [BASE IL MAIN BASE 1 237] (14)

   Event id: 3161 Source = MS Exchange MTA
   An internal MTA error occurred. The logon violated security. Entity name: .
   Error code: 0. [XAPI MAIN BASE 1 92] (14)

NOTE: Always use the Small Business Server Console to make changes to user
accounts as the User Manager for Domains does not update linked modules in Small
Business Server 4.5. The use of User Manager for Domains in a Small Business
Server 4.5 Environment may result in this error.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To resolve this, give the account on the Override tab Service Account Admin
Permissions on the Configuration and Site containers

1. Click the Site Connector, and on the File menu, click Properties. Note the
   Windows NT account that is specified on the Override tab, and close the Site
   Connector Properties page.

2. Click the Configuration container, and on the File menu, click Properties. On
   the Permissions tab, check to see if the account noted in step 1 is listed.
   If it is, verify that it has Service Account Admin permissions. If it is not
   listed, add the account, and give it Service Account Admin permissions.

3. Click the Site container, and on the File menu, click Properties. On the
   Permissions tab, check to see if the account noted in step 1 is listed. If it
   is, verify that it has Service Account Admin permissions. If it is not
   listed, add the account, and give it Service Account Admin permissions.

NOTE: Missing permissions can also prevent the Message Transfer Agent from
transferring mail to its own local information store.
