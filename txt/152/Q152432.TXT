TITLE   :XFOR: Comments in SMTP Addresses Cause NDR when Replying
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you receive an Internet message in a Microsoft Exchange client that has
multiple comments on the Address line, an attempt to reply to this message will
result in a Non-Delivery Receipt (NDR).

MORE INFORMATION
================

RFC 822 allows parenthesis, enclosed comments, to be placed anywhere in the
message header. If a message with multiple comments on the address line is sent
from the Internet to a Microsoft Exchange client, only the first comment is
stripped out. When you reply to this message, Microsoft Exchange will attempt to
resolve the remainder of the address (including the comment) as a valid address.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
