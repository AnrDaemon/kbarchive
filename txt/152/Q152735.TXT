SYMPTOMS
========

When run the Microsoft Exchange client with an Offline folder configured, you
may receive the following error messages:

   The file Path:\exchange.ost is in use and could not be accessed. Close any
   application that is using this file, and then try again.

   The set of folders could not be opened. The file Path:\exchange.ost is in use
   and could not be accessed. Close any application that is using this file, and
   then try again.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

Check to see if the Offline folder is currently being used by another Microsoft
Exchange user or if the file has been locked open. Use the Control Panel Server
applet to verify that the file is not locked open.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Offline folder (Path:\exchange.ost) can only be accessed by one Microsoft
Exchange user at a time. If multiple Microsoft Exchange users try to access the
Offline folder, only the first user will be allowed access to the file and the
additional Microsoft Exchange users will be refused access.
