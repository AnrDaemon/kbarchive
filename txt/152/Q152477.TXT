TITLE   :XFOR: Handshake Files Moved to BADMAIL Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 and the AppleTalk Mail Connector, the Network
Manager of the AppleTalk Mail system may messages with the following Subject:
line:

   Bad incoming message file

WORKAROUND
==========

There are 2 possible workarounds for this problem.

 - Set the aging factor option under the Gateway, Configuration... in the
   Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks client to a value of zero. This will
   keep both sides from generating a handshake file.

 - Use the Macintosh System version 7.5.1 on the PowerMac 6100 or install the
   gateway on a different PowerMac model.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This only seems to be a problem with PowerMac 6100 and 7100 computers. The
gateway picks up the Mmff1.msg file and should just discard it as a handshake
file, and no message should be delivered. However, the gateway does not appear
to recognize this file as a handshake message and moves it to the BADMAIL
directory.
