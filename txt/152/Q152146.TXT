TITLE   :SMS Admin Query Operators Not Available in Localized Versions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsmsAdmin smsadmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you run the localized SMS Admin UI on a localized version of Windows NT,
queries are not built. The Operator drop-down list box is empty.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because the operator string in queries is localized.
Therefore, without the localized DLL file, you cannot create a new query. If you
set the international setting (Country, Language) to a country (for example,
Austria) that is not the localized version from SMS (for example, German), you
will get an empty operator drop-down list box.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set all International Settings to the localized version from SMS, for example
German.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

Additional query words: prodsms operator
