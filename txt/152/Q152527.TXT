TITLE   :Err Msg: Keycheck Failed 0x8009030e
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install an SSL certificate on an IIS server using Setkey.exe, you may
get the following error message:

   Error: keycheck failed 0x8009030e

CAUSE
=====

There are two possible causes for this error:

 - The Keypair file or the certificate file used with setkey is not valid or is
   corrupt.

 - The certificate file (the text message sent to you by the Certificate
   Authority containing the SSL certificate) was saved in Unicode format.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure the certificate was not saved in Unicode format. Open the certificate
using Notepad.exe and select Save As. Make sure that Save File as Type is set to
Text Files (*.txt) not Unicode Files.

If the file was saved in Unicode format, click Save As on the File menu and
re-save it as text.

If the above resolution does not fix the problem, the certificate may need to be
re-generated and resubmitted to the Certificate Authority.
