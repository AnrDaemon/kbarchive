TITLE   :Library Odbc32.dll Could Not Be Loaded to Perform the Query
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use an Internet Database Connector (IDC) file with Internet
Information Server (IIS) to connect to a database (any type of database), you
may get the following error message:

   The library Odbc32.dll could not be loaded to perform the query.

CAUSE
=====

This error may be caused by the following:

 - The Odbc32.dll file is not installed or not in a location where IIS can find
   it.

 - The Odbc32.dll file is damaged.

 - The Odbc32.dll file permissions do not allow the IUSR_SERVERNAME account
   access to the file. This is common on domain controllers where the
   administrator has restricted permissions on the Microsoft Windows NT system
   directories to make the server more secure.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that Odbc32.dll file is installed, and check the file and directory
permissions on the file. The IUSR_SERVERNAME account must, at minimum, have READ
access to this file.
