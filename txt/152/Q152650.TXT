SUMMARY
=======

During the logon process, when running the hardware inventory phase on Windows
95 clients, the inventory window will change to "full screen" mode. This has
been known to affect screen resolution of notebooks and have an adverse effect
on touch screen monitors. To prevent this from happening, modify the
Lmscript.pif file located in the system directory on the client.

1. Using the My Computer icon, select the \Windows\System directory.

2. Find Lmscript.pif, select it and right-click on it.

3. Select Properties.

4. Select Program.

5. Select 'Minimized' from the Run dialog box.

6. Select Apply.

Next time the logon process runs, the logon window will remain minimized on the
task bar. Consequently, the screen never enters "full screen" mode.
