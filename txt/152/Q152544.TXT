TITLE   :XADM: GWART Shows Site Has Routing to Itself
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create:

 - A Microsoft Exchange Site, site1, with a country/region code of "A".

 - A Microsoft Exchange Site, site2, with a country/region code of "B".

 - An X.400 connector from site1 to site2.

 - An X.400 connector from site2 to site1

and then you change the country/region code of site1 to "B" on the Site
Addressing property page in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, the
Gateway Address Routing Table (GWART) on site1 will have X.400 routing to
itself. This will be over the X.400 connector from site1 to site2 and then the
X.400 connector from site2 to site1. It will have a cost of 2.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
