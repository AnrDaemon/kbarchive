SYMPTOMS
========

A PowerPoint presentation saved to a public folder fails to start. The following
error message appears:

   A problem occurred while working with, or connecting to, a linked or embedded
   object or its source application.

Exchange Macintosh client. If the presentation was moved to a public folder
using a drag-and-drop operation, the presentation will fail to open and will
present the error message above. If the presentation was posted to the public
folder, the presentation will open.

WORKAROUND
==========

Post the presentation to a public folder and avoid dragging and dropping the
presentation to public folders.

STATUS
