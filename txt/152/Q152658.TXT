TITLE   :XCLN: Sort Button Behaves Unexpectedly on Forms

SUMMARY
=======

You can set the List Values parameters on the Initial Value tab for a Listbox
object in the Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer. However, the Sort
button may not work as expected if duplicate List Values are created with only a
difference in the case of the letters. If the Sort button is pressed more than
once, the duplicate values might be sorted in a different order each time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, "Computer", "COMPUTER", "CoMpUtEr", "Apple", and "Dog" are added as
List Values and you press the Sort button numerous times. All of the computer
entries will appear between "Apple" and "Dog" but they will be sorted randomly.

This issue should not impact very many users because Listboxes are generally used
to list an array of different values. Where duplicate values are necessary, you
have complete control over the listing of the values by using the Move buttons
in the Initial Value dialog.
