PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0

KEYWORDS:kbVBp400bug kbVBp500fix kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Sheridan Tab control is resized such that the controls on a given tab can
no longer be seen, and if the focus is then changed to a different tab, then
when the Tab control is resized back to its former size the controls change
their parent to the tab which received focus after the initial resize.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only way to avoid this problem is to not resize the Tab control to a size
that hides the controls on the tab and then switches focus to another tab. If
the tab control is going to be resized to a small size which hides controls,
then it may be appropriate to hide the tab control completely rather then resize
it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps To Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place a Sheridan tab control on Form1.

3. Place a Command button in the middle of Tab 0. In the Click event for the
   Command button, place the following code:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            SSTab1.Height = SSTab1.Height * 0.1     ' If this is larger,
                                                    '  bug does not occur.
            SSTab1.Tab = 1                          ' Makes tab 1 active.
         End Sub

4. In the Click event for Form1, place the following code:

         Private Sub Form_Click()
            SSTab1.Height = SSTab1.Height * 10
         End Sub

5. Run the project by pressing F5. Click the button on Tab 0 to shrink the Tab
   control and make Tab 1 active. Then click Form1 to expand the Tab control.
   Note that the Command button is now on Tab 1, and Tab 0 now contains no
   controls.
