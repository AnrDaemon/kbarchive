TITLE   :PCMMac Error -39 in File Cpackage.cpp
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1

KEYWORDS:kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


When you send a package to Macintosh clients, the package arrives on the client
in the Package Command Manager window, but when you run it, the following error
message appears:

   Error -39 in File Cpackage.cpp, Line 570 eofErr.
   End of File
   Command Failed to Execute

   Error -39 in FileCTable.cpp, Line 198 eofErr.
   End of File.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error occurs if the source directory defined when the package was created
was not on a Windows NT file system (NTFS) partition.

When files are copied from an NTFS volume to an MS-DOS (FAT) volume, Windows NT
changes the file format, even though the long file names are retained. When the
package is copied back to an NTFS volume package share and distributed to the
Macintosh clients, the Macintosh file format is lost, and the Macintosh cannot
recognize the package.

RESOLUTION
==========

The source directory for Macintosh clients must be located on an NTFS partition.
