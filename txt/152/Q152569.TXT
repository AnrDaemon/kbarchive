The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

On a computer system that has advanced power management features or a manual
power standby button (commonly found on portable computers), invoking this power
feature will disable the SNMP agent. After the computer returns from the power
saving mode, the SNMP agent does not respond.

CAUSE
=====

The SNMP agent does not reset after a power saving mode has been released.


RESOLUTION
==========

The computer must be restarted to reinitialize the SNMP agent. If you use SNMP
frequently, you may also want to disable any automatic power saving mode that is
scheduled on the computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5, 3.51,
and 4.0 and Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
