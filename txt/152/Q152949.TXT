TITLE   :XFOR: Read Receipt is Received Instead of Return Receipt
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The problem occurs in the following scenario:

A Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Windows client version 3.5 sends a message to a
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice, which transfers the message over the
MS Mail Connector to a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server, which
transfers the message over the X.400 Connector to a remote X.400 Message
Transfer Agent (MTA). Finally, the message reaches an X.400 recipient.

The sender has selected the option "Return Receipt." However, the sender only
receives a Read Receipt back from the recipient. A Delivery receipt is not
returned from the remote X.400 MTA.

CAUSE
=====

By default, Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 maps the Microsoft Mail
"Return Receipt" option into the Read Receipt Request X.400 P2 flag.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
