TITLE   :XADM: Importing Blank Value Won't Modify Mailbox Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you import a comma delimited file into Microsoft Exchange Server by using
the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, and a blank value is included, the
existing value on the General tab of the Mailbox properties page will not be
replaced.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If there is a value on the General tab, the comma comma value (,,) import will
not change the value to blank. The same will occur if a comma space comma is
used (, ,). To replace a value on the General tab of the Mailbox properties
page, the imported file must contain a comma double-quote space double-quote
comma value (," ",).
