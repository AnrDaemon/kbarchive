The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure the Command window in the Visual FoxPro
screen. Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, like most Macintosh applications, does not
have a parent application window. Many users want to simulate the windowing
behavior of the Windows version within the Macintosh version. The Visual FoxPro
Screen can provide some of this functionality including controlling the
placement of the command window and preventing the Visual FoxPro Screen from
obscuring other windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This information covers customization through the default configuration file,
Config.fpm.

Method 1
--------

One of the most flexible Config.fpm commands is COMMAND. This allows you to pass
any command you could enter in the Command window to Visual FoxPro every time
you launch. The limitation to COMMAND is that only the last COMMAND line is
processed. To include multiple commands in your configuration file, simply call
a separate program file with multiple commands, without the COMMAND syntax. For
example, assume you wanted to activate the Command window within the Visual
FoxPro screen, display a picture, and wanted to call VFPStart, the program which
initializes and adds Class Browser to the Tools menu:

In your Config.fpm, place the following line:

      COMMAND = DO Startup.prg

The program file, Startup.prg, might look like this:

      DO HOME()+"VFPStart.prg"
      ACTIVATE WINDOW COMMAND IN SCREEN  && IN SCREEN clause is the key
      _SCREEN.PICTURE="<path>:pict or bmp file"

Method 2
--------

An alternative is to change the default setting of MACDESKTOP. When set to OFF,
this specifies that windows reside on the main FoxPro for Macintosh window.
Windows cannot be moved outside the main FoxPro for Macintosh window. If this
setting is changed from within the Config.fpm, it will also affect system
windows, such as the Command window. This will also cause all user-defined
windows to be defined within the main Foxpro for Macintosh window by default.

In your config.fpm, place the following line:

      MACDESKTOP = OFF
