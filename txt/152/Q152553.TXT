TITLE   :Print Jobs from MAC OTI Clients May Hang in WinNT Print Queue
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you print to a Windows NT Server with Services for Macintosh installed from
an Apple Macintosh client running (OTI) Open Transport Protocol, the print jobs
will hang in the Windows NT print queue for up to 30 minutes. The print jobs
hang indefinitely in a "spooling" state.

This problem is caused when you send a print job to Windows NT from a Macintosh
client running OTI. When the Macintosh client finishes sending the job to
Windows NT, the LaserWriter driver sends out its PAP EOF and ATP EOM, then it
sets up a data structure and waits for the transaction release (TRel) coming
back from the Windows NT Server. The result is that the client never sees the
TRel and never breaks down the connection before it receives an OpenConn PAP
request. The TRel is coming back from Windows NT before the LaserWriter driver
is ready to handle the TRel, resulting in the job staying in a spooling state on
the Windows NT Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem was fixed in the latest Apple LaserWriter driver. For information
about obtaining this driver please contact Apple Computer, Inc.

This issue has been seen most commonly with the following printer:
