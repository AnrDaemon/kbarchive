TITLE   :How To Call a Visual FoxPro Application Using AppleScript
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Since Visual FoxPro for Macintosh does not create stand-alone executables as
FoxPro 2.6 did, AppleScript will not be able to directly call the executable
with the TELL statement. This behavior occurs because the executable will
require the use of one of the Visual FoxPro Support Library files to run.
AppleScript will have to TELL the Visual FoxPro Support Library.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample AppleScript below will TELL the Visual FoxPro Support Library to open
a Visual FoxPro executable named "MyProgram.exe" that is located in the MyApps
folder on the Macintosh HD, activate it, and then have it display a Wait Window
containing the text "Hello World!":

      tell application "VFP Support Library PPC"
         open "Macintosh HD:MyApps:MyProgram.Exe"
         activate
         Do Script "WAIT WINDOW 'Hello World!'"
      end tell

Note that the Visual FoxPro executable must have a READ EVENTS in it so it does
not quit as soon as it is finished launching.

The main program of the MyProgram.Exe file should contain code similar to the
following:

           Do Mymenu.mpr
           READ EVENTS

The Mymenu.mpr program has an option to CLEAR EVENTS to allow the executable to
be exited. For more information on READ EVENTS and CLEAR EVENTS, see Microsoft
Visual FoxPro Online Help.
