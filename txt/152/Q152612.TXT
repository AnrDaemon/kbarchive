TITLE   :Err Msg: Drvspace 484... Incompatible Compression Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are attempting to perform any operation with Drvspace.exe, you may
receive the following error message:

   The compression driver that is currently loaded is incompatible with your
   version of Windows compression.

   Drvspace 484

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for either of the following reasons:

 - The following line appears in the Dblspace.ini file:

   Drvspace3 = 0

 - An old or damaged version of the Drvspace.bin or Dblspace.bin file exists on
   the hard disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the Dblspace.ini file.

2. Delete the following line:

   Drivespace 3 = 0

If this does not resolve the problem, replace all occurrences of the Dblspace.bin
and Drvspace.bin files using one of the following methods:

 - If you installed Microsoft Plus! and are using DriveSpace 3, extract the
   Drvplus.bin file from the Plus_1.cab file on the Microsoft Plus! CD-ROM or
   disk 1, then rename the extracted file to Drvspace.bin.

 - If you do not have Microsoft Plus! installed and are using DriveSpace,
   extract the Drvspace.bin file from the Precopy1.cab file on the Windows 95
   CD-ROM or disk 1.

 - If you updated your Startup disk when you compressed your drive, a copy of
   the Drvspace.bin file also resides on the Startup disk.

marks) at a command prompt, or see the following article in the Microsoft
