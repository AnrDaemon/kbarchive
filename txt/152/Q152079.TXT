TITLE   :SNMP Traps Contain Invalid Agent ID Field
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp4fix kbSDKPlatform kbSNMP kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Agent ID field in SNMP traps do not contain the source computer's IP
address. The IP address, which is contained in this field, is always of the form
0.0.x.y where x.y is the decimal representation of the first four hexadecimal
digits of the computer's host name.

CAUSE
=====

If the computer has a host name which is exactly 12 characters long and consists
only of valid hexadecimal characters (1-9 and A-F), then the SNMP trap
generation code assumes that the host name is actually a valid IPX address and
places an invalid address in the Agent ID field.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the following:

 - Make sure the host name is not 12 characters.

 - Make sure one of the characters in the host name is not a valid hexadecimal
   character.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
