TITLE   :Netlogon Service Does Not Start After Applying SP4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Netlogon service on random platforms does not start after applying Service
Pack 4 (SP4) for Windows NT 3.51.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Netlogon service tries to add itself to the Administrator's group to
start up, it hits a condition that keeps the Netlogon service from starting.
This occurs on the first restart after applying SP4. Although the security
accounts manager (SAM) is apparently upgraded to its new format, the condition
described above prevents the upgrade from taking place, rendering all further
access to the SAM impossible. De-installing Service Pack 4, even when it
preserves SAMSRV.DLL, does not fix the problem since the SAM itself has not been
upgraded properly.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
