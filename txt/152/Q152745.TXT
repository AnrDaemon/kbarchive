SUMMARY
=======

Public folders should always be deleted from a Microsoft Exchange client, not
the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program. To delete a folder, you must be
the owner of the folder. If you are an administrator and you need to delete a
folder, add Owner permissions for yourself to the public folder, and then delete
the public folder through the following procedure:

1. From the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, under Organization,
   Folders, Public Folders, select the specific public folder that needs to be
   deleted.

2. Click Properties on the File menu.

3. Click the General tab, and select Client Permissions.

4. Add or change ownership of the public folder.

Now log on to Exchange Server from an Exchange client using the account that now
has ownership of the public folder, and delete the folder.
