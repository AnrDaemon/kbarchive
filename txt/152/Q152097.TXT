SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a new discussion Web to the current Web, the files of the first
discussion Web are overwritten.

CAUSE
=====

The Discussion Web Wizard creates the names of the pages using an algorithm that
uses the name of the discussion group entered in the wizard. If both of your
discussion Webs have similar names, the files of the first discussion Web may be
overwritten. This problem occurs only if both discussion Webs are created in the
same Web.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1
--------

Create your second discussion web in a separate subweb. Doing this removes all
possibility of conflict.

Method 2
--------

If you want both discussion webs to reside in the same Web, make sure that the
first four characters of each discussion group are unique. You can do this by
making sure that either the first four characters of the discussion title are
different, or by making sure that the title contains two or more words separated
by spaces.
