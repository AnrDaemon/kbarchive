TITLE   :File Manager Incorrectly Reports Free Space on 3.5-inch Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use File Manager to check the available free space of a blank 3.5- inch
disk, it will report 1,457,152 bytes. However, CHKDSK or WINMSD will report
1,457,664 bytes available, a difference in free space of 512 bytes

CAUSE
=====

This is a problem with the way File Manager displays free disk space. The
available space reported by CHKDSK is correct.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
