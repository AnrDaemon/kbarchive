TITLE   :XCLN: ErrMsg: Need Additional Space to Complete This Operation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you compose a message with a large attachment and use an Offline folder,
you may receive the following error message:

   You need additional space to complete this operation.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

Free up disk space on the drive that contains the Offline folder then click
Services on the Tools menu. Select the Advanced tab; select Offline Folder File
Settings, and click Compact Now. This process will free up the unused space
created by inserting a file as an attachment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you choose to click OK to the error message dialog box described above, and
you click OK to the Insert File dialog box, you will get the following error
message:

   The file <path>:\exchange.ost could not be accessed. There is not
   enough space on the disk.

This means you have 9.5K of disk space left on your partition that contains the
Offline folder file.

If you select the Cancel button while you are in the Insert File dialog box, in
order to save the current message, you should free up enough disk space on the
same drive as the existing Offline folder file to accommodate the large
attachment.

You can cancel the new message by clicking Close on the File menu. When you get
the dialog box, "Do you want to save changes to this item?", click No.

The Offline folder file will still contain the maximum amount of the attachment
it can hold.

If you click any folder or try to make any changes in configuration to Microsoft
Exchange, you will get the following error message:

   The folder could not be opened. The file <path>:\exchange.ost could not
   be accessed. There is not enough space on the disk.
