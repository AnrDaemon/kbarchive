SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run one of the programs listed at the top of this article on a
Windows 95 computer with an STB Powergraph 64 video card or an S3 Vision 968 PCI
video card, you may receive the following error message:

   Your program is making an invalid dynamic link call to a .dll file.

This error occurs when you are using the Video English without STB Vision 95
display driver.

This error also occurs in Flight Simulator, version 6.0 if you are using the S3
Trio 32/64 PCI display driver from STB.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "sysedit" (without the quotation marks) and click OK.
   This opens the System Configuration Editor, with several files open and
   displayed on the screen.

3. Click the title bar of Win.ini to bring it to the front.

4. On the Search menu, click Find.

5. In the Find box, type "drawdib" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   Next.

6. In the [drawdib] section, add the following entry:

   dva=0

NOTE: If there is no [drawdib] section, add the following to the Win.ini file:

   [drawdib]
   dva=0

7. On the File menu, click Save.

8. Exit the System Configuration Editor.

9. Restart Windows.

The program should now run successfully.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "dva=0" entry turns off direct video access (DVA) and DCI. DVA and DCI allow
video images to be sent directly to the screen. If a program detects the display
type incorrectly, problems can occur using DVA and DCI. Some of these problems
can be severe (such as general protection (GP) faults in Gdi.exe). When you turn
off DVA and DCI, video images must be drawn through GDI. Although using GDI can
be slower than direct access, it is safer.
