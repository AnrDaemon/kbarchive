SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a dual boot machine, a Microsoft Exchange client for one of the
operating systems on drive C:, a Microsoft Exchange client for the other
operating system installed on drive D:, and you reinstall the Microsoft Exchange
client on drive D;, several files will be deleted from the Microsoft Exchange
client directory on drive C:.

This will only occur if both Microsoft Exchange clients were installed using the
default directory name. In addition, if you perform a Remove All before the
reinstall, no files on drive C: will be affected.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The files that will be removed from the C:\Exchange directory are Exchng32.exe,
Mlshext.dll, and Scanpst.exe.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
