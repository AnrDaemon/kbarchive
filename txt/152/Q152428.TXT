TITLE   :Initialization Failure in Rasman.dll When Shutting Down
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT may stop responding on shutdown and/or the following message may
appear:

   Initialization of the dynamic link library
   c:\winnt35\system32\rasman.dll failed. The process is terminating
   abnormally.

CAUSE
=====

The service controller issues an asynchronous TransactNamedPipe and asks it to
read four bytes to a stack variable. It then waits two minutes for the
TransactNamedPipe to finish. After two minutes it returns from the function
without canceling the operation. When the operation finishes it overwrites the
stack.


RESOLUTION
==========

The I/O operation is canceled before the function returns.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
