SUMMARY
=======

The setting of Refresh in Visual FoxPro has a direct effect on buffered data. If
the command:

      SET REFRESH TO 0,0

is issued in a program, or if:

      REFRESH=0,0

is placed in the Config.fpw file, the buffers are never refreshed due to the
second parameter being a zero (0).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The setting of Refresh will have an effect on the Browse and also have an effect
on the Grid container.
