The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no way for an application program to control whether an SNA Server
LUA RUI or SLI call will return synchronously (that is, block the calling
thread) or asynchronously. The call may complete immediately (for example
if data has already arrived to complete a read request), though in most
cases the call will return immediately with the primary return code set to
LUA_IN_PROGRESS (0x0030). In this case, the application must use whatever
asynchronous completion method it chose to wait for the verb to complete.

Asynchronous completion methods are described in Chapter 2 (pages 17 and
18) in the SNA Server LUA Programmer's Guide. SNA Server 3.0 documents this
in the LUA Programmer's Guide section of the SNA SDK Documentation applet.
