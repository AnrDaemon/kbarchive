TITLE   :XADM: Checking Knowledge Consistency Msg Freezes at 33 Percent
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program may stop responding when you
click the "Check Now" button in the Directory service dialog box. The Microsoft
Exchange Server stops responding at the point when the Knowledge Consistency
Checker "percent complete" message reaches 33 percent.

CAUSE
=====

This is because of the path where Microsoft Exchange Server is installed. The
path D:\Local\Exchsrvr can cause this to happen.

STATUS

version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
