TITLE   :Example Shows How to Pass Objects to FLL

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro provides eight new API routines that allow you to manipulate
Visual FoxPro objects and controls. In addition, the Value structure defined in
the Library Construction Kit (LCK) has been expanded to use object references.
This article gives an example showing how to pass and receive object references
within an LCK routine.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following C code illustrates how to use one of the new API routines, which
requires an object reference (_WGetObjectClientWindow) and returns a handle to
the window containing the passed object. The LCK routine clears the command
button from the window to verify that the program is working as expected.

FoxPro Code
-----------

   * Place the following code in the Click event of a button on a form:
   SET LIBRARY TO clearwind.FLL ADDITIVE
   = CLEARWIND(this)  && we are passing the button object to the C routine
   RELEASE LIBRARY clearwind

C Code
------

   #include <pro_ext.h>

   void FAR ClearObjWin(ParamBlk FAR *parm)
   {
      WHANDLE Wh;
      \\ Note that you are passing the address to the Value structure.
      Wh = _WGetObjectClientWindow(&parm->p[0].val);
      _WClear(Wh);
   };

   \\ Note below that the parameter type is "O" (for Object).
   FoxInfo myFoxInfo[] =
   {
      {"CLEARWIND", (FPFI) ClearObjWin, 1, "O"},
   };

   FoxTable _FoxTable =
   {
      (FoxTable FAR *) 0, sizeof(myFoxInfo)/sizeof(FoxInfo), myFoxInfo
   };
