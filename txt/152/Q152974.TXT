SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to restore the default fonts included with Windows
95. This may be necessary if one or more font is missing or damaged.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows 95 Setup program has a Restore Windows Files option that you can use
to restore missing or damaged font files. To use the Restore Windows Files
option to restore the default font files, run Windows 95 Setup from within
Windows 95. If Setup finished successfully the last time you ran it, the
following choices are displayed:

 - Restore Windows files that are changed or corrupted

 - Copy all Windows files again

Choosing the first option replaces only files that are missing or have changed
since the last time you ran Setup. Choosing the second option replaces all
files.

If the Restore Windows Files option does not appear when you run Setup from
within Windows 95, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   Q141841 Restore Windows Files Option Missing from Setup

In Windows 95, each font has one or more files associated with it. Although a
font's properties normally identify the files associated with the font, it can
be difficult to determine which files are associated with a font. In addition,
it can be difficult to determine the name of a font. For example, the font that
Windows 95 uses to display text in menus, title bars, and dialog boxes is a font
installed on your computer, but it is often difficult to determine which font
Windows is using.

Because it can be difficult to determine which files are associated with a font,
or to determine the name of a font, it may not be possible to restore missing or
damaged fonts by extracting individual files from your original Windows 95 disks
or CD-ROM. Restoring the default fonts using the Restore Windows Files option in
Setup is a much more reliable method.
