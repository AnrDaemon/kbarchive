TITLE   :XADM: Unable to Enable Advanced Security on User Account
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv exc4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to enable Advanced Security on a user mailbox within the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program, you may get the following error message:

   The advanced security operation failed due to an unknown cause. Restart the
   Administrator program or the Key Management server, or both, and then try
   again.

   Microsoft Exchange Administrator
   ID no: c1031252

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if a comma was used in the directory name for the user
mailbox object.

WORKAROUND
==========

To check, run the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program and check the
properties for the user's mailbox. Then click the Advanced tab and look the
Directory Name.

Currently there is no way to modify the Exchange X.500 database, so the user
account will need to be deleted and recreated to fix the problem. Move the
user's mail to a .PST file. Delete and recreated the user's mailbox, then import
the .PST file back onto the server store.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0.
