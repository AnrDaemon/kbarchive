======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click any of the buttons at the bottom of the main screen (Contents,
Chefs, Recipes, Lessons, Julia's Kitchen, Index, Back, or Options) in Julia
Child , you receive the following error message:

   Insufficient memory to function properly. Please close other applications or
   documents.

CAUSE
=====

The error message may be caused by a missing entry in the [mci extensions]
section of the Win.ini file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that an [MCI Extensions] section exists in the Win.ini file. Then make
sure the section contains the correct entries. For example, the following
entries are required for Julia Child to run properly:

       [MCI Extensions]
       avi=AVIVideo
       wav=waveaudio

If the above entries do not exist or are incorrect, make the necessary changes
using a text editor such as Microsoft Notepad.

For more information about how to accomplish these tasks in Windows, see your
Windows printed documentation or online Help.
