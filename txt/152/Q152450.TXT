TITLE   :Change Password Dialog Text Changed for NetWare
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are logged on to Windows NT 3.51 with a NetWare enabled account in a
domain, and you change your password by using CTRL+ALT+DEL, the following
NetWare network pop-up message appears:

   Please go to the Command Prompt and run Setpass (located in SYS\PUBLIC on
   NetWare Server) to change your password on NetWare Server.

This message is misleading, especially if the system is running Directory Server
Manager for NetWare (DSMN). With DSMN, both the Microsoft and NetWare passwords
are changed automatically.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
