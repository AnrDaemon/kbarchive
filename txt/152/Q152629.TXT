TITLE   :Setup Requires Unusually Large Amount of Disk Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Installing Windows 95 on a compressed hard disk may require an unusually large
amount of disk space. Instead of the 40-90 MB that Setup usually requires, it
may require up to 256 MB of free space.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the compressed hard disk has an estimated compression
ratio (ECR) that is much higher than the actual compression ratio (ACR). Setup
calculates the free disk space manually and converts its result to match the
amount needed given the current ECR.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either or both of the following methods:

 - Free the amount of hard disk space Setup requests.

 - Change the ECR to match the ACR. For MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2, use MS-DOS
   DoubleSpace (Dblspace.exe). For MS-DOS 6.22, use MS-DOS DriveSpace
   (Drvspace.exe).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 Setup does not use the free space information provided by DoubleSpace
or DriveSpace. Instead, it determines the actual amount of free space on the
hard disk and then applies a calculated compression ratio to the Windows 95
files. The amount of hard disk space requested is the amount actually required
adjusted to match the ECR.
