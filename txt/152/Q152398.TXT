TITLE   :Login.exe Now Sets Primary Server After Successful Login
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using Microsoft Login.exe some applications may prompt the user to log on
to the network even though the user is currently logged on.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Login.exe neglects to set the shell's primary server after a
successful login. Setting the primary server is the responsibility of the login
program. It should be set to the login server's connection ID (value of 1-8
representing the login server's row number in the shell's connection table). The
Logout.exe program resets this field back to zero (indicating not logged on).
Many applications call the SetPrimaryServer API to differentiate the true login
server from other attached servers. Also, some applications assume that if this
value is zero (that is, not set), the client computer is not logged in. An
example of a program which has difficulties with this situation is McAfee's
NetTOOLs.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the fix referenced below.LOGIN.EXE has been modified to now set the
shell's primary server after a successful login.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for
NetWare version 3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
