SUMMARY
=======

The Anonymous Posting service will allow you to have users post anonymous
submissions to a Microsoft Exchange Public Folder (PF). This article describes
the steps necessary to set up the Anonymous Posting service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps are required to set up the Anonymous Posting service:

1. Create a Windows NT service account. Make sure that you grant this account
   the Logon as a Service privilege. In addition, make sure that this account is
   a member of the ADMIN group. If this account does not have administrative
   privileges, you will receive the following error:

   Could not start the Anonymous Posting Service on \\<Computer_Name>.
   Error 1069: The Service did not start due to a Logon Failure.

2. Create a mailbox named Anonymous. Set the Primary Windows NT Account for the
   mailbox to the user account created in step 1. At this point, make sure to
   note the following settings of the Mailbox:

O

   rganization Name
   Home site
   Directory Name (Advanced Tab for the Mailbox)

3. Create the anonymous PF:

   a. Create the PF from a Microsoft Exchange client.

   b. Open the folder properties and select Permissions.

   c. Add the Anonymous mailbox to the permissions list with the Editor Role.

   d. Select to the Administration tab and select the folder assistant.

   e. Add a rule, select FROM, choose the anonymous mailbox, and click OK.

   f. Choose FORWARD TO, select the anonymous mailbox, and choose OK.

   g. In the folder assistant dialog box, click Edit Rule, and then click
      Delete.

   h. Click the advanced button, check the box labeled Only Items That Do not
      Match These Conditions, and Click OK.

   i. Close all remaining open dialog boxes.

4. Copy the Anonymous Posting service files from the Microsoft Exchange Server
   CD to a directory on your hard drive where you want to run the service from.
   These files are located in the following location:

   \Setup\<platform>\sampapps\server\anon

5. Install the files necessary for the Anonymous Posting service. Do this by
   running the Instanon.exe program that you copied in step 4. You will need to
   enter the information that you wrote down when you created the Anonymous
   mailbox. Choose OK to install the service.

6. Make sure that the Anonymous Posting account has the following rights in the
   Microsoft Exchange permissions context:

    - In the site object, the Anonymous Posting account needs at least the
      Administrator role.

    - In the Organization object the Anonymous Posting account also needs at
      least the Administrator role.

7. To test the Anonymous folder, start a Microsoft Exchange client, go to the
   Anonymous public folder, and compose a new post in this forum. Type in a
   message and post the message.

8. If the Anonymous Posting service is not running, you will be able to post a
   message with no errors, but the message will not appear in the PF until the
   service is restarted.
