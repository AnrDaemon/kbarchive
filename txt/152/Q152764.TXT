TITLE   :Garbled Characters Appear in Windows NT Print Queue

KEYWORDS:kbprint kbWinNT400sp4fix kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a downlevel client (such as Windows 95) sends a print job to a Windows NT
print server, you may not be able to read the document name on the server's
print queue; however, the document prints correctly.

CAUSE
=====

A downlevel client sends the document name formatted in its codepage and the
protocol is not able to specify the codepage used. If the server has the same
locale settings as the client, the document name is readable. However, there is
a problem where the ANSI codepage is used to translate the document name instead
of the OEM codepage.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
