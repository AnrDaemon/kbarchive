KEYWORDS:kbProgramming kbCompiler kbLangCPP kbVC kbVC410bug kbVC420bug kbVC500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling a program that calls the function "L" using a macro will cause the
following errors:

   error C2065: 'x' : undeclared identifier

   error C2064: term does not evaluate to a function

where "x" is the last letter of the macro identifier.

CAUSE
=====

In this case, the preprocessor incorrectly generates the letter "x" as the
resulting output.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use any other letter after "L" in the macro body.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code
-----------

      /* Compile options needed:
      */ 
          #define thing L

          void  L() {}

          void main (void) {
             thing();
          };
