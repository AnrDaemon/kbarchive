TITLE   :CSNW Does Not Report Directory Restrictions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

NetWare has the ability to restrict the space that a directory can occupy on a
volume. This is not a volume level restriction and is not set on a per user
basis. If a user connects to a NetWare server through Client Services for
NetWare (CSNW), they will see the entire free space of the volume returned by
File Manager and DIR, even if the directory they are viewing has been
restricted.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT does not support directory space restrictions.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the user connects directly to the directory in question, Windows NT will
return the restricted size. For example:

Instead of:    NET USE F: \\NWSERVER\SYS
         CD \APPS
         DIR

Use:        NET USE F: \\NWSERVER\SYS\APPS
         DIR

This will work as long as the volume is less than 2 gigabytes (GB) in size. If
the volume is larger than 2 GB, Windows NT will still return the total free
space.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51>.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
