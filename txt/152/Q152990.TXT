TITLE   :100-Megabit Ethernet May Hang or Exhibit Poor Performance
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The client system may stop responding when transferring files between two
Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51 computers using 100-megabit Ethernet cards
over a 100-megabit segment. The receiving system or client stops responding and
the CPU usage stays at 100 percent until the file transfer is completed. You may
also see lower than expected transfer rates.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the Server Optimization to Balance on both
the Windows NT Server and Windows NT Workstation. To change the Server
Optimization for a Windows NT Server, configure the Server service using the
Control Panel Network tool, and set Server Optimization to Balance. To change
the Server Optimization for a Windows NT Workstation you need to modify the
Registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) select the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet \Services\LanmanServer\Parameters

2. Add or change the following value:

   Size REG_DWORD: 0 x 2

The value 0 x 2 sets the Server Optimization option to Balance.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT versions
3.50 and 3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
