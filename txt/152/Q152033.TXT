The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft PowerPoint has the ability to freely rotate native objects. Native
objects are objects created with PowerPoint text and drawing tools. Some
imported objects can be converted to PowerPoint objects and then rotated. This
article describes how to rotate an object from Clip Gallery.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To rotate a clip art object, first ungroup and then regroup the object.

Import a Clip Art Object into PowerPoint
----------------------------------------

1. On the Insert menu, point to Picture, and then click Clip Art.

2. Select a thumbnail, and then click Insert.

Rotate the Clip Art
-------------------

1. Click the clip object to select it. When the object is selected, eight
   handles should surround the object.

2. On the Draw menu, click Ungroup. You may see a message similar to the
   following:

   This is an imported object, not a group. Converting it to PowerPoint objects
   will permanently discard any embedded data or linking information it may
   contain. Convert to PowerPoint objects?

   Click OK to convert the object. This step breaks the object into several
   PowerPoint objects.

3. With all objects selected, click Group on the Draw menu. This makes the clip
   image one object, rather then many small pieces.

4. On the Drawing toolbar, click the Free Rotate Tool.

5. Rotate the clip image by clicking one of the corner handles and turning the
   object around by the handle.

Ungrouping an object severs the link between that Object Linking and Embedding
(OLE) server (the application used to create the object) and PowerPoint. You can
no longer edit that object within the server application.

NOTE: You may be able to restore the object using the Undo command.
