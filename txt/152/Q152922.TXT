TITLE   :XGEN: SMTP Addresses Don't Extract from MAC Mail to Exchange PAB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SMTP addresses are not extracted when migrating MAC Mail personal address list
(PAL) entries to Microsoft Exchange Windows client personal address book (PAB).
The following is an example of what occurs with a valid SMTP address:

   entry,User 1,user1@company.com

Note that the SMTP address type is not specified.

CAUSE
=====

The extractor does not attempt to recognize SMTP addresses and tag them as such.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Service Pack o4 Microsoft Exchange
Server 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

Service Pack 2 is required to create a Windows PAB from the MAC PAL. It is not
possible to create an Exchange MAC PAB from a MAC PAL. For more information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152895 XADM: Unable to Migrate PABs for Appletalk Mail Users

SMTP addresses are the only address types that are correctly migrated. X.400, PC
Mail, and Exchange addresses are not migrated although they might appear to be
after the migration. After you import the PAB (the Migrate.pab file is created
by running the Appletalk Mail Source Extractor) into a Microsoft Exchange
Windows client, the only names that are valid are the ones with SMTP addresses.
All other addresses will give the following undeliverable message from the
System Administrator:

   No transport provider was available for delivery to this recipient.
