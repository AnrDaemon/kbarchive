TITLE   :XCLN: Details Corrupt When Using Spanish Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to view address book detail information, secondary property
pages are not readable. This occurs when viewing the address lists on a
Microsoft Mail postoffice using the Spanish language Exchange Windows 95 client.

CAUSE
=====

When a Microsoft Mail postoffice is installed for the Spanish language clients,
Spanish-specific TPL files are installed in the TPL subdirectory. The
Spanish-specific TPL files listed below have improper values for the Alias and
Nombre fields. These TPL files incorrectly specify lengths of 31 when it should
be a value of 30.

   SPACOU00.TPL     SPAALIAS.TPL     SPACOU02.TPL       SPACOU04.TPL

WORKAROUND
==========

A self-extracting zip file has been created that includes replacements for the
affected files. The filename is Tplspan.exe. Expand this file into the TPL
subdirectory and run the Replace.bat file to rename the original files and
substitute the corrected files.

The following corrections have been made in the TPL files indicated:

SPACOU00.TPL
     Alias:~9~31~A~~             changed to        Alias:~9~30~A~~
     Nombre:~9~31~A~~            changed to        Nombre:~9~30~A~~
SPACOU02.TPL
     Nombre:~7~31~A~~            changed to        Nombre:~7~30~A~~
SPAALIAS.TPL
     Alias:~9~31~ULNP~~          changed to        Alias:~9~30~ULNP~~
SPACOU04.TPL
     Alias:~9~31~ULNP~~          changed to        Alias:~9~30~ULNP~~

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail version 4.0.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Contact
Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
