SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the behavior of the X400 Connector Stack Property Page
with respect to the Outgoing and Incoming OSI Address Information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OSI Protocol Information that is present on the Stack Property Page refers
to how a remote system should be contacted (Outgoing T/S/P selectors), and how
they will advertise themselves when they contact the local X.400 Connector
(Incoming T/S/P selectors). These selector values always refer to the remote
system. In general, a Remote X400 system will advertise itself with the same OSI
information Outgoing as Incoming. Exchange stores its own "advertising
name/address" in the Transport Stack page.

If the Incoming OSI Protocol Information is left blank with no values entered,
then it will DEFAULT to the values specified in the Outgoing OSI Protocol
Information field. That is to say, the X.400 Connector will expect to be
contacted with the same T/S/P selector values (Incoming) as defined in the
Outgoing.

For instance, consider the example configuration below for the following OSI
address information.

OSI Protocol Information:

Outgoing:
     T     FOREIGN
     S     FOREIGN
     P     <blank>

Incoming:
     T     <blank>
     S     <blank>
     P     <blank>

When the X.400 Connector receives an incoming X.400 connection, it will expect
the T and S Selectors to have a value of FOREIGN, and the P Selector to be
blank. This is because the Incoming information is <blank>, and the
default behavior is to assume the same Incoming as Outgoing if the Incoming
values are not overridden.

Here is an example where the Incoming values differ from the Outgoing.

OSI Protocol Information:

Outgoing:
     T     FOREIGN
     S     FOREIGN
     P     <blank>

Incoming:
     T     FOREIGN
     S     <blank>
     P     <blank>

In this example, the X.400 Connector will connect to the remote X.400 entity with
a T and S Selector of FOREIGN, but expects to receive only a T Selector of
FOREIGN as a reply (with the S Selector being blank).
