SUMMARY
=======

When you use Directory Import and Directory Export on the Tools menu in the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, it is possible to use a space or tab
as the separator for the .csv file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are performing a command line import or export (ADMIN /i or ADMIN /e),
you will need to specify the separators in the Options file.

The options are as follows:

If you are using a space delimited .csv file,

   ColumnSeparator=32
   QuoteCharacter=32
   MVSeparator=32

If you are using a TAB delimited .csv file,

   ColumnSeparator=09
   QuoteCharacter=09
   MVSeparator=09

For example, if you are performing a command line import, your command line
should be the following:

   admin /i user.csv /o import.ini

where the IMPORT.INI file has the following:

   [Import]
   ColumnSeparator=09

If you are exporting to an existing .csv file that contains a separator other
than what is specified by ColumnSeparator, the columnseparator will be ignored.
In this case, you should export to a new file.
