The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you copy files using File Manager, the read only attribute is maintained
when the file is copied. When you copy the same file at the command prompt using
the copy or xcopy command, the read only attribute is stripped and the
destination file is no longer read only.

STATUS
======

This behavior is expected in order to allow the copy and xcopy commands to
remain consistent across operating system platforms.
