the Directory Import command in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program may
fail to create the mailbox correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Directory Import divides the import file into several pages to read it. The page
size is 4 KB on an x86 processor. When the import file includes double -byte
characters and its boundary is at the point of a multiple of 4 KB, Directory
Import may not work correctly.

In other words, when the lead byte of the double-byte character is at the
4,096-byte point and the trail byte is at the 4,097-byte point, this problem may
occur.

Three kinds of phenomena have been confirmed:

 - All mailboxes after 4 KB are not imported.

 - Only the mailbox that includes 4-KB point is not imported.

 - All attributes after 4 KB are out of order.
