-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

Applications that repeatedly use the Win 32 call ControlService() with the
SERVICE_CONTROL_INTERROGATE flag may result in a memory leak in services.exe.

To identify the leak, monitor memory allocations of Services.exe using Pmon.exe,
or monitor private bytes of Services.exe using performance monitor. The
allocated bytes will increase abnormally over time.

CAUSE
=====

A pointer was allocated to hold the service image name that was not freed after
querying the status for a driver.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
