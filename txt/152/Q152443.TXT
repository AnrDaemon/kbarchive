SUMMARY
=======

When you use the PKZIP program from PKWARE, files with long file names can
become corrupted.

Files appear to compress correctly, but when they are de-compressed, those with
long file names may not decompress correctly and the following error is
displayed by PKUNZIP:

   Pkunzip (W26) Warning! Filename.zip has errors!

Where Filename.zip is the name of the archived or compressed file.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you plan to use PKZIP to either archive or compress files, file names in the
archive should be limited to the standard MS-DOS eight plus three convention.
(Eight characters, period, and an optional three-character extension.)
