When you use Remote Control to access a Windows client, the fonts are not
displayed correctly. They are spaced out and cannot be read. Some strings are
truncated, some strings are too long and some strings are overlapped by some
others.


CAUSE

This problem occurs when a Cirrus Video Adapter and the Cirrus driver V1.24
(driver GD5434 set to more than 16 colors) are used together.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, install a 16 color video driver.
