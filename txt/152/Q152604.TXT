TITLE   :XADM: Functionality Provided by Set as Default Option
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you select the Set as Default check box when connecting to a server or
starting a monitor, the server is not automatically connected to the next time
the action is completed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Selecting the Set as Default check box sets the default server for the next time
the connection is attempted; however, the connection is not automatically
initiated

This is by design. If the connection were fully initiated without prompting, the
administrator would not be able to change the server that was being connected
to. The functionality provided by the Set as Default check box is that the
server previously specified should appear automatically in the box so that the
browse button does not have to be used.
