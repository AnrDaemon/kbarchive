TITLE   :XADM: Exchange IS Error 1025
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Information Store may report the following error in the Event Log:

   Event ID: 1025
   Source: MExchangeIS Private
   Type: Warning
   Category: Transport

   Description:
   An error occurred.
   Function name or description of problem: EcGenerateNRN:
   Error:0x8004010f

CAUSE
=====

This happens when an expired message is in a mailbox that has never been logged
on before and the message has a Read Notification Request. While trying to
generate the Non-Read Notification (NRN), a logon object is supposed to be
created for this mailbox, but at that point no Windows NT User Name is available
because this is not a real logon from the user. The logon code tries to cache
the Windows NT User Name, but because it does not have the Windows NT User Name,
it cannot. At this point, the error code that it used to check whether the
Windows NT User Name is already cached is not cleared properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server, version
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
