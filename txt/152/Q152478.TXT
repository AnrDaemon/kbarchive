======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you have set up Microsoft Windows NT, joined a domain, and restarted, you
attempt to log on locally. The following error message may be displayed:

   The local policy of this system does not permit you to logon interactively

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the domain user does not have local logon rights to
the computer while connected to the domain.

NOTE: If TCP/IP is installed on the computer, another indication that the domain
user does not have local logon rights is that entering the ipconfig/release
command from a command prompt on the computer results in the following error
message:

   Access Denied

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem and provide local access when connected to the domain,
do the following:

1. Log off the domain and log on to the local computer using an account with
   administrative rights.

2. Go to the Administrative Tools group, select User Manager, click the Policies
   tab, and select User Rights.

3. Use the down arrow next to the "Right" dialog box and select "Log on
   locally", and then click Add. The Add Users and Groups dialog box is
   displayed.

4. In "List Names From:" select the domain name, and then in the Add Names box
   type your <domain name\username>. Click OK. The User Rights Policy
   dialog box is displayed with the new user name added to the list. Click OK.

5. Log off and back on. At the Welcome dialog box, select the domain and log on.
   You now have local logon access rights.

NOTE: If you cannot access the computer locally, you can use the Ntrights.exe
utility to remotely add the user right.
