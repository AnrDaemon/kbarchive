This tool allows you to test the different capabilities of RDO and your ODBC
driver without writing any code. After making a successful connection, it also
allows you to view the RDO code it used to make the connection, and to analyze
the ODBC API trace log produced.

RDOTEST.EXE requires the installation of Visual Basic 4.0 Enterprise Edition on
Windows NT 3.51 (or higher), Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, or Windows 95 (or
