SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the MS MAIL 32 SPOOLER, the following error message
appears:

   Mail could not connect to your Mail server. The configuration for the Mail
   server path is missing or invalid.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused when attempting to start the MS MAIL 32 SPOOLER before
Microsoft Mail is completely set up and configured. If the MAIL icon has been
changed to start Mailsp32.exe instead of Msmail32.exe, and Mail has not been
configured on this computer, the error will occur. In addition, the error occurs
if the MS MAIL 32 SPOOLER is invoked from the command line.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure Microsoft Mail on the local computer before attempting to start the MS
MAIL 32 SPOOLER.
