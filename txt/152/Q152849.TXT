The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the disk that a Key Management (KM) Server password is located on is lost or
damaged, and the password on the disk is unknown, the following procedure can be
used to reset the KM Server password.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Have the users decrypt any encrypted messages (or else they will not be able
   to read them once they get a new security key). They can do this manually or
   use the bulk security tool SECTOOL.EXE (included with the Microsoft Exchange
   Resource Kit) to decrypt them all at once.

2. Run KMSERVER -u (you must use lowercase) to remove the Microsoft Exchange Key
   Management Service.

3. Remove the directory where the Key Management server was installed.

4. Reinstall the KM Server software to generate a new key for encrypted
   messages.
