TITLE   :XCLN: How to Display the Secondary Mouse Menu
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0

KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Because the Apple Macintosh does not have a "secondary" mouse button, you must
use a key combination (Shift+F10) to display the secondary mouse menu.

For example, select the Deleted Items folder. Press Shift+F10. You can now "empty
the folder" without having to select and delete all messages in the folder.

When using the Exchange Client for the Macintosh version 5.0, you may also hold
the CONTROL key down while clicking an object to access the secondary menu.

Note: For Shift+F10 or CONTROL click to work you must be at a point where you can
insert text. For example: to add a series of addresses to the Personnal Address
Book (PAB) you need to perform a Reply All to a message and Shift+F10 or CONTROL
click on each address that you want to add to the PAB.

Additional query words: 4.00 5.00 right click mouse button
