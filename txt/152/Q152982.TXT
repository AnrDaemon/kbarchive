MORE INFORMATION
================

This can be modified by following the steps listed below for each client.

If Microsoft Exchange is being started from the desktop, then a Short Cut must be
created to modify the Startup directory. The file properties can not be modified
on the Inbox icon.

To create the short cut, right click the Desktop, and choose Shortcut from the
New menu item. Create a shortcut to Exhcng32.exe and set the shortcut property
for Start In directory to the desired location; for example, C:\TEMP.

Microsoft Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups: and Windows NT 3.51
------------------------------------------------------------------

With the Microsoft Exchange icon selected in Program Manager, click Properties on
the File menu. Set the Working Directory to the desired location; for example,
C:\TEMP.
