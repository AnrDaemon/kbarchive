SYMPTOMS

When you send a Microsoft Fax from Microsoft Word while Microsoft Exchange is
offline (.OST file) and off the network, you will get the following error
message:

   Information Store could not be opened.

This happens when you use an .OST file only. It works fine when you use a .PST
file.

Faxes can be sent if the Microsoft Exchange client is already started and
working offline.

here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
