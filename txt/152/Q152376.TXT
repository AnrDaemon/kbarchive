SUMMARY
=======

Push-button controls on a DialogBar cannot be disabled by calling EnableWindow.
The following code has no effect:

      GetDlgItem(IDC_BUTTON1)->EnableWindow(FALSE);

This article describes how to implement push-button controls that can be
disabled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Controls on a DialogBar behave like the bitmaps on a Toolbar. They can be
enabled or disabled by manually adding an ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI within the
message map of the appropriate class (such as CMainFrame).

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

After you have placed a control on your DialogBar, such as a push-button with a
resource ID of IDC_BUTTON1, use the following steps to manage the state of the
control:

1. Within the declaration of your class, add the declaration for a handler
   function:

      afx_msg void OnUpdateButton1(CCmdUI* pCmdUI);

2. Within the implementation of your class, add a manual entry in the message
   map:

      BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP(CMainFrame, CMDIFrameWnd)
          //{{AFX_MSG_MAP(CMainFrame)
          ...
          //}}AFX_MSG_MAP
          ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI(IDC_BUTTON1, OnUpdateButton1)
      END_MESSAGE_MAP()

3. Provide the definition of the handler function, as follows:

      void CMainFrame::OnUpdateButton1(CCmdUI* pCmdUI)
      {
          pCmdUI->Enable( TRUE );
      }
