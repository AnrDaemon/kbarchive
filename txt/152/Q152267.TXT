KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows 95, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95 might fail to start following the
removal of an application. The Microsoft Exchange logo will appear for several
seconds, and then disappear, but the Microsoft Exchange client does not start.

CAUSE
=====

An application was removed that used Msvcrt40.dll. An example is Microsoft
Visual C++. Removing the application might have deleted Msvcrt40.dll without a
warning that this DLL is shared and also used by the Microsoft Exchange client.

When you try to install the Exchange client, if the Msvcrt40.dll file is
corrupted or the wrong version, you may receive the following error message:

   Internal error installing forms

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the Msvcrt40.dll and then reinstalled the client. Once Msvcrt40.dll is
installed, the client will function as expected.

Additional query words: msvcrt40 Exchange client startup hang msvcrt40.dll disappear
