SUMMARY
=======

The halftone option with the Windows NT PostScript driver does not have any
effect on a document containing text or vector graphics.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT PostScript driver uses the host to perform halftoning when the
option is selected in the PostScript driver. This setting has no effect on
non-image output. If you are just printing text or vector graphics, no
halftoning will be done on the host.

In contrast, the Windows 95 driver does not actually do halftoning on the host
computer. Instead, it sends halftone settings (angle and frequency) to the
printer, and this affects all PostScript drawing operators including vector
graphics and text.

When the Halftoning option is selected in the Windows NT PostScript driver, the
driver performs halftoning on the host. This only works when the source data is
bitmap. If the source data is text or vector graphics, the driver doesn't have
any bitmap information to work with. Instead, it generates appropriate
PostScript operators and sends them to the printer. These would then get
halftoned by the printer.
