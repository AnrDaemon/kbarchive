TITLE   :Schedule+ 7.0 is Unable to Write to Schedule+ 1.0 CAL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Schedule+ on Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, with mixed
Microsoft Schedule+ 1.0 and Microsoft Schedule+ 7.0 users, you might have
interoperability issues in which a Microsoft Schedule+ 7.0 user can only open a
Microsoft Schedule+ 1.0 CAL file as Read Only. In this mixed environment, you
can no longer have unattended resources like conference rooms and must manually
handle meeting requests for these resources.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the Service Pack applied, you will be able to write from Microsoft
Schedule+ 7.0 into a Microsoft Schedule+ 1.0 file for single-instance
appointments and meetings. Writing contacts, tasks, or recurring appointments
will still fail.

For more information about Schedule+ 1.0 and 7.0 interoperability, please see the
