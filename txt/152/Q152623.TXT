SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Setup Editor can only be used to customized a Microsoft
Exchange client installation point that uses the same language as the Setup
Editor itself. The Microsoft Exchange Setup Editor is available in 4 languages;
English, French, Japanese, and German.

If you run the Setup Editor for one language against a client installation point
for another language (for example, using a French Setup Editor against a Spanish
client installation point), you will receive the following error:

   The STF in the specified directory is not a MS Exchange Client STF file.
   Check the value of the "Frame Caption" Header entry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The English, French, German, and Japanese Setup Editors do not support localized
STF files in other languages, hence the 'Frame Caption' error. This is by
product design.
