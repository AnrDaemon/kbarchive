TITLE   :How To Add BMPs to Picture Properties in OutLine Control

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The On-line Help for the PictureClosed, PictureOpen, and PictureLeaf properties
states that these properties can display either bitmap files (*.BMP) or icon
files (*.ICO). This article describes how to add or change a BMP or ICO file in
the PictureClosed, PictureOpen, or PictureLeaf properties through the interface
of the OutLine control. This cannot be done programmatically.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When using the Outline control, the Style property has 5 items to select from:

1. Picture and Text.

2. Plus/Minus and Text.

3. Plus/Minus, Picture, and Text.

4. Treelines and text.

5. Treelines, Pictures, and Text.

Choosing 1, 3, or 5 allows pictures to be used when items are listed in the
Outline control. If an item has sub-items under it, the PictureClosed and
PictureOpen properties can be used to show a different BMP or ICO to illustrate
if the item is displaying those sub-items or not. The default pictures show an
open folder for the PictureOpen property and a closed folder for the
PictureClosed property. Any BMP or ICO can be used for these properties, but
they have to be assigned in the Properties box for the Outline control in design
mode.

Step-by Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a form and choose an OLE container object from the Forms control
   toolbar.

2. Click the Insert Control button, and select Outline control from the
   Control_Type box.

3. Place the cursor over the OutLine control and click the right mouse button.

4. After selecting Properties from the menu box, choose the Pictures tab. There
   will be a Property Name combo box that allows the selection of the
   PictureClosed, PictureOpen, and PictureLeaf properties.

5. Use the Browse button to select a BMP or ICO for the selected property.
