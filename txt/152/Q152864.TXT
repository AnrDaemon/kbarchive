TITLE   :XFOR: Exchange Doesn't Handle Multiple Comments in Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are connected to Microsoft Exchange Server and you receive a message from
a user on the Internet with multiple comments on their address line, their
return address will be incorrectly formed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if the users' e-mail address is:

   USER1@HOST.DOMAIN (Comment 1) (Comment2)

Microsoft Exchange Server will try to reply to:

   USER1@HOST.DOMAIN (Comment 1)

This will result in a Non-Delivery Report (NDR) and the reply message will not
reach its destination.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
