SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol in Windows 95, you may not be
able to connect to other computers on the network.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the frame type setting for the IPX/SPX- compatible
protocol on your computer differs from the frame type being used on the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that the frame type setting on your computer matches the frame type
setting on the server. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click the Network Neighborhood icon on the
   desktop, and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

2. On the Configuration tab, click IPX/SPX-Compatible Protocol, and then click
   Properties.

3. Click the Advanced tab.

4. In the Property box, click Frame Type.

5. Note the setting in the Value box. If this setting does not match the setting
   in use on the server, click the appropriate frame type in the Value box, and
   then click OK.

6. Click OK.

7. If you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.
