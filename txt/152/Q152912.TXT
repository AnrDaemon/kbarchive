SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to synchronize an offline public folder with an online public
folder, and the online public folder has a delete rule, the following error
might occur:

   This folder could not be synchronized. Consult the synchronization log in the
   deleted items folder for details.

The synchronization log will contain the following message:

   Error synchronizing message '<message subject>'
   [80040800-3ED-0-324]
   Unknown Error.
   Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store
   Error synchronizing folder
   [80040800-3ED-0-324]
   Unknown Error.

The message will stay in the offline folder.

CAUSE
=====

The return code generated by the delete operation is treated as an error by the
synchronization process.
