PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Exchange PC Message Transfer Agent (MTA) and Microsoft
Exchange MTA configurations as a back-bone for MS Mail for PC Networks
Postoffices, Schedule+ meeting requests forwarded to and accepted by an
assistant will be booked in the assistant's appointment book, not the original
attendee.

MORE INFORMATION
================

User1 sends a meeting request to User2, who has an assistant. When the assistant
opens the Schedule+ meeting request and accepts the meeting, the meeting will be
booked in the assistant's calendar file, not the original attendee's.
