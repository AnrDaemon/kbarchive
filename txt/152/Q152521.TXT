SYMPTOMS
========

File type definitions for Microsoft Excel 4.0 for the Macintosh do not get set
when you install the Microsoft Exchange client. Without the correct entries in
the registry these Macintosh files cannot be opened on the IBM- compatible
computers because the correct extension for the file can not be determine.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

This works correctly in Microsoft Exchange version 5.0.
