TITLE   :Browser Returns Truncated List of Resources
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A domain user will get a truncated list of resources when they browse the domain
with File Manager or the Net View command.

CAUSE
=====

The browser service can only return 64 KB of domain/server names per transport.
If the resource list for a domain cannot fit in a 64 KB buffer, the user will
get a truncated list of resources available on the domain.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following workarounds:

 - Break up the current single domain into multiple domains.

   -OR-

 - Reduce the description text for the servers in the domain. More servers can
   fit in the 64 KB buffer this way.

Note: Use the Server Manager for the domains to reduce the Description Text.

STATUS
======

The 64KB domain/server names per transport limitation has been removed in a
Windows NT 4.0 Browser environment. All Browsers involved in transferring the
Browse list to the client, and the client itself must be Windows NT Version 4.0.
In a large Browser environment, this means that the Primary domain controller
which takes on the especial role of being the Domain Master Browser, and the
Master Browser on the client's segment, and all Backup Browsers on the client's
segment must all be Windows NT version 4.0 for the Browser list to exceed 64KB.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
