TITLE   :XADM: Non-Delivery Reports Incorrectly Returned in German
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork exc4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This behavior has been observed in Windows NT versions 3.51 and 4.0 and is
independent of which language version of Microsoft Exchange Server is
installed.

Non-delivery reports (NDRs) from Admin.exe are returned in German when the
Regional Settings in Control Panel for Windows NT are set to Spanish. Normal
NDRs generated by the Microsoft Exchange Server continue to be in the correct
language. The problem occurs when mail is returned from the Messages Queued page
in the Microsoft Mail Connector object and the "Send Non-Delivery Reports when
messages deleted" checkbox is selected. The message is deleted and an NDR is
generated, but the message returning to the original sender is in German.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Service Pack 3 of Microsoft Exchange
version 4.0 For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
