TITLE   :TcpipClientSupport Fails w/ NetWareClientSupport Specified
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to change a Windows NT password with the Microsoft Exchange Client,
the change fails to work using TCP/IP. The client error message may be:

   The NT Domain password could not be changed. A required action was not
   successful due to an unspecified error.


CAUSE
=====

If the primary domain controller (PDC) has the NetWareClientSupport registry
value specified for the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA
key, but the NWLINK protocol is not installed on the PDC, LSASS will not attempt
to register a socket endpoint on TCP/IP.


RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the registry value NetWareClientSupport if NWLINK is not installed on the
PDC.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
