KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a network installation of Microsoft Windows 95 is directed to a Microsoft
Windows NT Server on either File Allocation Table (FAT) or Windows NT File
System (NTFS) for the path of the installation, the dates of all the files are
changed to reflect the current date. This causes problems with system management
when trying to determine the correct date and time of Microsoft Windows 95
files.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: setup 95 3.50 3.51
