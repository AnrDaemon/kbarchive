TITLE   :XADM: Backfilling Public Folders takes a Long Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0, it is possible that all public folder
replication messages will be sent but not processed. This will not result in
permanent data loss because the backfill entries will eventually timeout and the
hierarchy backfill process will continue. It does mean that the process of
creating the hierarchy on newly added or wiped-clean Microsoft Exchange Servers
will be much more time consuming than it should be.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You will notice this when you add or delete servers. Replication will be more
time consuming that it should be. You may also notice the delay when no
Microsoft Exchange Server responds.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
