The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use a custom configuration file. Visual FoxPro
determines valid configuration file usage by both filename, format, and type.
This allows multiple custom configuration files to exist in one location while
having a system default.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to ensure that Visual FoxPro uses a custom configuration file, the
following items must be considered:

1. The custom configuration file must have a type of "FFPM" and a creator of
   "FOXX." These types can be set by using the FoxTools call FxSetType() or the
   sample form :sample:tools:setconfig:setconfig.scx.

2. The default configuration file, CONFIG.FPM, must not exist in either the
   Visual FoxPro or the System Folder. If it does, it will always be used.

3. The format of the configuration file must be text and it must adhere
   syntactically to those conventions and limitations outlined for the default
   configuration file.

4. Visual FoxPro must be launched through the custom configuration file either
   by dropping the custom configuration file onto Visual FoxPro or opening the
   custom configuration file from the Finder.
