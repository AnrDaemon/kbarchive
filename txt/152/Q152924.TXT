TITLE   :XFOR: DXA Sends Invalid Replace (R) Transactions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Exchange Server is acting as a requestor to an MS Mail
directory synchronization server, the Exchange requestor may send replace (R)
transactions for the entire postoffice defined as the secondary proxy after
manually adding a secondary MS Mail proxy for a user.

CAUSE
=====

When sending an address from Microsoft Exchange, the directory synchronization
service (DXA) gets all the proxies for an address and then scans them looking
for the native address type. Once DXA finds the native address type, it
considers using it as part of the DirSync cycle. If the DXA finds a secondary
proxy that meets the string-insensitive comparison, the DXA uses it. It should
always use only the primary proxy (which has an uppercase address prefix).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
