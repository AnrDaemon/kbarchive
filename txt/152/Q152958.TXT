TITLE   :XADM: Organizational Forms Unavailable to Other Servers in Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange clients might not see any Organizational forms available from
the Compose-New Form... option or when using the Manage... command button on the
Forms tab when viewing the properties of a folder.

CAUSE
=====

If the Organization Forms folder for the Microsoft Exchange Site has been
deleted and then recreated, clients on other Microsoft Exchange Servers in the
Site will not be able to see the Organizational Forms until all Servers have
been rebooted.

WORKAROUND
==========

Reboot all Microsoft Exchange Servers in the Microsoft Exchange Site and any
Server that might contain a replica of the Organizational Forms folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Organizational Forms folder has a unique folder Entry ID (EID). When this
folder is created initially, this EID is cached by all Microsoft Exchange
Servers in the same Microsoft Exchange Site as well as all Servers that contain
a replica of the Organizational Forms folder. This cached EID can be updated by
stopping and restarting the Exchange services. In some cases it may require the
Server to be rebooted. Therefore, if the Organization Forms folder is deleted
from the Server where it was originally created and then a new Organizational
Forms folder is created, a new EID will be assigned to this folder. All Servers
in the Site and all Servers containing a replica of this folder will need to
restart the Exchange services or be rebooted to cache this new EID.
