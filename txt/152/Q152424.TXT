TITLE   :XFOR: Exchange Requestor Drops Users After Dirsync
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Exchange Server acts as a directory synchronization (dir-sync)
requestor, it may drop custom recipients from its Global Address List (GAL).
This occurs when it processes specific transactions that have been inserted into
dir-sync through a manual import file.

CAUSE
=====

Users are dropped when transactions are received that follow the alternative
format suggested in the "Microsoft Mail Administrator's Guide," for versions 3.2
and 3.5. On page 328(page 330 of the 3.5 manual), the following example is given
for modification of a user's template information:

   M George Jones
    - Title:/Sales Rep
    - Local:/3423
    - Department:/Sales

Microsoft Exchange will respond unpredictably when it processes a transaction in
this format. One effect often seen is that it drops the user from the GAL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange Server. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


WORKAROUND
==========

To make template modifications without encountering this problem, construct the
input file using modify transactions similar to the following:

   M George Jones                   PCM:ABC/TESTING/GJONES
     George Jones                   PCM:ABC/TESTING/GJONES
    - Title:/Sales Rep
    - Local:/3423
    - Department:/Sales

Notice the extra line added beneath the line beginning with M. Microsoft Exchange
expects transactions in this two-line format.

If users have been dropped from the GAL due to this problem, request a full
import and the users will be restored on the next dir-sync cycle. To request a
full import on Microsoft Exchange, start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program and view the properties of the Dir-Sync Requestor object. On the
Settings property page, select the Import on Next Cycle checkbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

See Appendix A of the Microsoft Exchange Administrator's Guide for additional
information regarding the import program and its use with an import file.
