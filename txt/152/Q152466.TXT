======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If for any reason you find that the Systems Management Server registry entries
have been removed from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services, and
there are no backups in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet00x\Services and you
have not taken backups of these registry keys, you can still restore them using
INSTSRV.

MORE INFORMATION
================

INSTSRV is a utility contained on the Systems Management Server compact disc in
the Debug\X86.bin directory. To begin the service re-creation, perform the steps
below.

1. Copy INSTSRV from the compact disc to the \Sms\Site.Srv\x86.bin directory.

2. Open a command prompt window.

3. Run INSTSRV (it is an MS-DOS Menu tool).

4. Select '1. Install'.

5. Enter the service name 'SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER'.

6. Enter the domain name\account name to start the service (for example,
   thekop\smsadmin).

7. Type the password for the user.

   NOTE: The password will be displayed on the screen.

8. Enter the Systems Management Server site server name (for example,
   \\BOOTROOM).

9. Enter the path to the service:

   c:\Sms\Site.Srv\X86.Bin\Siteins.exe

10. Autostart the service during startup - 'Y'.

11. Restart the server, or go to Control Panel Services and restart the service.

12. Site Configuration Manager should re-create the remaining Systems Management
   Server services in the registry (SMS_HEIRACHY_MANAGER, SMS_EXECUTIVE,
   SMS_INVENTORY_AGENT, and SMS_PACKAGE_COMMAND_MANAGER).

13. After you have your services restored, go into the Registry Editor REGEDT32
   and make backups of each of these keys by saving them to a file.
