TITLE   :XFOR: IMC May Cause WorldTalk SMTP/MIME Gateway to Stop
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The WorldTalk SMTP/MIME gateway stops responding.

CAUSE
=====

Messages sent from the Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Connector (IMC)
may cause the Worldtalk SMTP/MIME Gateway to stop responding. The IMC in some
cases generates a multipart message with a null content-type header.

The WorldTalk SMTP/MIME Gateway can receive mail successfully if the header is
not present at all, or if the header is as follows:

   Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Note that the first bodypart in the message outbound from Microsoft Exchange does
have the correct content-type.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

The WorldTalk gateway is manufactured by World Communications, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
