TITLE   :XADM: French Connectors Disks not Recognized
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the French version of Microsoft Exchange from the Select CDs
into an existing Microsoft Exchange Site, it will ask you for a connectors disk
that you can create from the (Select Server Pool) PC Server 7 disk. None of the
connectors disks that you create will be recognized by the Microsoft Exchange
Setup program. You will not be able to complete the installation without the
connectors disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

On any of the French connectors disks that you created, rename Install.exe to
Setup.exe and retry the installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The version of Microsoft Exchange that is shipped on the Select CD's is the
Single Server version. When you select Install into an Existing Site, the
Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) must be enabled. To enable this,
you must provide at least one connector disk.
