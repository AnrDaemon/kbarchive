SYMPTOMS
========

If the network card's I/O address is set to 200h, hardware inventory will hang
and ultimately fail when trying to detect the game port.

CAUSE
=====

When inventory verifies whether the game port adapter is in the computer (using
Getother.exe), it makes a call to port 201h (this is the industry standard
setting for game ports). This call impinges on the network card address range,
causing the network connection to hang.

The issue is discussed in QUE's "Upgrading and Repairing PCs" (4th edition):

   The game adapter does not use much in the way of system resources. The
   card does not use an IRQ, DMA channel, or memory, and requires only a
   single I/O address (port) 201h. The adapter is controlled by reading and
   writing data to and from port 201h.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are three possible workarounds to this problem:

1. Set the net card I/O address to another value (recommended).

2. Create an Smssafe.tmp file and add "GamePorts=CRASHED" to prevent it from
   being inventoried.

3. Remove Getother.exe from your SMS site, so that the it is never called during
   the inventory process. (Not Recommended)
