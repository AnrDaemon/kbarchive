-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.11 SP1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The SNA Server 2.11 Windows 3.x client software supports the Windows IBM PC
Support compatible APPC router interface through an SNA Server version of
EHNAPPC.DLL. This article documents Win.ini configuration settings for the SNA
Server Windows APPC router.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SNA Server 2.11 Windows 3.x client supports the following Win.ini
configuration settings:

   [SnaServerEHNAPPC]

      LocalLU = <local LU alias>

      LocalTP = <local TP name>

      <SYSTEMNAME> = <USERID>

      UseBlockHook = YES

More detail on each parameter is given below:

LocalLU
-------

The LocalLU parameter assigns a specific Local LU alias to be used by the SNA
Server Windows APPC router. If none is specified, a Local LU alias must be
defaulted in the SNA Server configuration, through at least ONE of the following
methods:

 - by assigning a default Local LU to the appropriate User or Group entry in the
   SNA Server Users and Groups window.

 - by enabling the checkbox in the Local APPC LU dialog for "Member of default
   outgoing Local APPC LU Pool"

If a default Local LU is not defined, the PC Support program may encounter the
following error:

   error = 0x51 ( or 81 decimal, EHNAPPC_INVALIDLUNAME)

NOTE: The LocalLU parameter must be present if CA400SharedFolders=YES is
configured (when running IBM Client Access shared folders), or the CA/400 shared
folders dialog may hang when started.

LocalTP
-------

This optional parameter allows the SNA Server Windows APPC router to be
configured with a specific Local APPC TP Name parameter. This parameter is
passed to the SNA Server Windows APPC TP_STARTED call, though it is not required
by SNA Server. If this entry is not configured, a default of "ROUTER" is used.

<SYSTEMNAME> = <USERID>
-----------------------

The SNA Server Windows APPC Router will automatically save the AS/400 User ID
used to sign on to each AS/400 "SYSTEMNAME" (or Remote LU alias). When the SNA
Server Enhanced Router sign-on dialog is displayed, the User ID field is filled
in according to the User ID saved for this system name. The AS/400 system name
and user ID must be capitalized.

There is no way to specify the AS/400 password within WIN.INI. However, once the
user enters the AS/400 password within the enhanced router sign-on dialog, the
SNA Server Windows APPC router will save the password in memory and use it if
further conversations are attempted by the application, or any other PC Support
applications. If all PC Support applications are stopped and unloaded, the SNA
Server router password cache is cleared.

NOTE: When terminating IBM Client Access/400, most CA/400 applications leave
their DLLs in memory, so the SNA Server router password cache is not cleared.


If the application calls EHNAPPC_QueryUserID and a NULL location name is passed,
the following entry may be configured in Win.ini to return a specified User ID:

   DEFAULT = <user id>

The SNA Server Windows APPC router supports concurrent communication with up to
32 unique AS/400 systems.

UseBlockHook
------------

If UseBlockHook is set to YES (all upper case), then the SNA Server APPC router
calls WinAPPCSetBlockingHook on behalf of the PC Support application.

If UseBlockHook is not present, it defaults to NO. WinAPPCSetBlockingHook allows
a Windows 3.x application to issue a "blocking" APPC call without blocking other
16-bit Windows processes running on the system. For more information about this
function, see the SNA Server APPC Programmer's Guide.
