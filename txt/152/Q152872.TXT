The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Microsoft Schedule+ without a local .scd file and the network
connection is lost, when Microsoft Schedule+ is launched again, you will not be
able to save changes to the calendar file.

The following error will be reported:

   The new item could not be inserted. The schedule is being used by someone
   else. Try again later.

CAUSE

When network connections are lost, your calendar file can retain stream locks.
The Microsoft Exchange Server can maintain a stream lock until the network
timeout is reached. The network timeout for TCP can be up to two hours.

STATUS

version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
