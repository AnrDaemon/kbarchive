======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Windows NT Resource Kit utility Remote Command Service (RCMD),
you may receive the following error message:

   Failed to connect to <\\\\servername>, Error = 123

CAUSE
=====

This error message may appear because, while in an interactive multisession, you
entered the server name with leading backslashes.

RESOLUTION
==========

When in interactive multisession mode, RCMD prompts for the server name on which
to run a remote command and expects only the NetBIOS name of the server without
the leading backslashes.

For more information on the proper usage for Rcmd.exe, type the following at a
command prompt and press ENTER:

" rcmd /? " (without the quotation marks)

For more information on RCMD, see the following article in the Microsoft
knowledge base:
