-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, versions 3.11, 3.11a, 3.11b

SUMMARY
=======

When logging on to the domain, a client will get one of the following error
messages:


   If a Windows 95 client: "The domain password you supplied is not correct, or
   access to the logon server has been denied."

   A Windows for Workgroups 3.11 client: "The password you specified is
   incorrect or your account is inactive. See your network administrator for the
   password or to activate your account."

   A MAC client: "The password is not correct"

The logon is unsuccessful when logging on as a user; however, the administrator
successfully logs on from the same client.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the Everyone Group has been removed from "Access this
computer from network" user right from User Rights Policy in User Manager on the
primary domain controller (PDC). This built-in right is required for Domain
Users to log on to the domain.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem,perform the folowing steps.

1. Log on to the domain as administrator and start User Manager for Domains.

2. From the policies menu, choose User rights and select "Access this Computer
   From Network."

3. Click Add and select the Everyone Group.

Note: The Everyone Group is not required to access the domain. Specific users and
groups can be added to accomplish the same goal, but if any user is not on the
list they will not be able to log on to the domain.
