PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Although Toshiba 400 Notebook Computers are on the Hardware Compatibility List
(HCL) for Windows NT, a few difficulties can occur due to the power- saving
features of these notebook computers. Specifically, these problems occur when
the computer is turned off with "resume mode" enabled or when the computer
enters "sleep mode." Upon resuming use of the computer after either of these
conditions, access to PC Card devices may no longer be possible.

RESOLUTION
==========

Toshiba does provide utilities that allow the resume mode and sleep mode to
operate with Windows NT without affecting operation of the PC Card devices in
Windows NT. These utilities are available from the Toshiba web site as
RNT030US.EXE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In general, notebook computers are tested for compatibility with Windows NT with
power conservation features disabled. On a Toshiba notebook computer, this is
accomplished by booting MS-DOS and running the Toshiba TSETUP utility. Both the
sleep mode and resume modes should be disabled.

STATUS
======

of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
