TITLE   :XFOR: SMTP CRs Routed to Home Site Before Going Out IMC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mail addressed to Microsoft Exchange SMTP custom recipients will not be sent by
an alternate Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) if the Microsoft
Exchange Server at their home Site is down.

CAUSE
=====

All Microsoft Exchange SMTP custom recipients are assigned a home Site, and all
mail sent to them must first travel to the home Site before it is sent out over
the IMC. In fact, message tracking will show the mail addressed as
'exchangeuser@exchangeserver' while it is en route to the home Site. The home
Site is responsible for resolving the Microsoft Exchange mail type to an SMTP
mail type.

If the Microsoft Exchange Server at the home Site is down, then the mail will not
go out to the external user through another IMC because it hasn't been resolved
to an SMTP mail type (it is still addressed as 'exchangeuser@exchangeserver'),
even if another IMC is available.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
