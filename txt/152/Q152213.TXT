SYMPTOMS

appear:

   cannot open PID file...setup aborted

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows 95
----------

The best solution is to optimize Windows 95 for Flight simulator. To optimize
Windows 95 for Flight Simulator, see the following article(s) in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q140600 DF1269: Optimizing Windows 95 for Flight Simulator

   Q138208 How to Create a Flight Simulator Shortcut in Windows 95/98

MS-DOS
------

This issue is caused by conflicting terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs or
insufficient environment space and can usually be resolved by creating the
Fssystem boot disk when running on a MS-DOS based system.

NOTE: Do not create a system Startup disk on systems running Microsoft Windows
95.

Fssystem.exe creates a boot disk with the optimum memory configuration for your
machine. See the inside back cover of your Microsoft Flight Simulator Pilot's
Handbook for more information on how to use Fssystem.exe.

To increase the environment space, open the Config.sys file in a text editor
(such as Notepad) and add the following line

   SHELL=C:\<valid path>\COMMAND.COM /E:1024 /P

where <valid path> is the path to your Command.com file.
