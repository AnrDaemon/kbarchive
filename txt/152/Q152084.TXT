TITLE   :Insufficient Memory Error Using Internet Explorer 2.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:; winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the SETUP.EXE from an Internet explorer 2.0 Package for Windows
3.1 in Package Command Manager (PCM), you get an "insufficient memory" error.


CAUSE
=====

PCM executes the command, which is Setup.exe, as expected. Setup will extract
Acmsetup from the .cab file, start it, and terminate. After the termination PCM
of course closes the connection to SMS_PKGD because Setup.exe terminated without
errors, but Acmsetup needs the connection to complete.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Use EXTRACT.EXE to extract all files from IEW31_1.CAB in a new directory.

2. Add the files Files.inf, Setup.ini and Iew31_1.cab from the original setup
   directory, so that the files in the new directory are:

   _Mssetup.exe
   Acmsetup.exe
   Acmsetup.hlp
   Basic.dll
   Comctlie.dll
   Files.inf
   Iew31_1.cab
   Internet.stf
   License.txt
   Mscpydis.dll
   Mssetup.dll
   Readme.txt
   Setup.ini
   Setup31.dll
   Stacdial.inf

3. Create a Run Command on Workstation Package and use the commandline:

   ACMSETUP /T internet.stf

4. Create a job for this package and send it to the clients.
