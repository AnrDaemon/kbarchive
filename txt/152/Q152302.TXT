TITLE   :Files Saved to NetWare Server via GSNW Don't Retain Case
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The file names of files saved to a NetWare server through Gateway Services for
Netware (GSNW) do not maintain the correct case. If the file is saved in
lowercase with fewer than 8 characters, it will default to all uppercase. If the
file name is greater than 8 characters, the lowercase format is maintained. This
may cause case-sensitive applications to fail.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
