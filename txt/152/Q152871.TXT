TITLE   :XADM: Restore Re-populates Deleted Folders
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible that one or more folders that were deleted from a Microsoft
Exchange Server may return after you perform a restore from a backup. This will
happen if the folders were deleted between the time of the backup and the time
of the restore.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This can happen if a Microsoft Exchange Server in the Microsoft Exchange Site
has a bad folder tombstone table. The Microsoft Exchange Server being restored
might try to backfill the missing changes from the Microsoft Exchange Server
with the bad tombstone table. This will cause the deleted folder to be returned
via the backfill process.

The only workaround is to delete the folder again and let the delete replicate
throughout the Site.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
