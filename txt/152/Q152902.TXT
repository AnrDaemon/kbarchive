TITLE   :XADM: Continuous Attempts to Publish Free/Busy Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange, a countdown is set whenever the server schedule receives
an unknown or Free/Busy notification. When the countdown reaches zero, the
Free/Busy information is published.

If the publish fails, the countdown is reset to the same wait. However, if the
Public Folder server is gone, the time-out to determine this exceeds the
countdown and the idle engine calls back for Microsoft Exchange to retry nearly
immediately.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use a doubling retry time-out, maximum of 30 minutes. After each failure, the
time to the next attempt doubles until the wait peaks at once every 30 minutes.
Once the Free/Busy information is published, the time-out restores to 30
seconds.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

Free/Busy publish retry rate after failure tended to be too high; therefore,
almost all of the Microsoft Exchange Server time was spent in Free/Busy publish
attempts and not giving any time to the user.
