SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows NT your mouse cursor may freeze intermittently, but you
will still be able to use the keyboard to navigate the desktop. You have to
restart the computer for mouse functionality to be regained.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft mouse has the ability to reset itself in the event it detects any
electrical interference. A reset on the mouse occurs when there is excessive bus
noise or other electronic disruptions. A mouse reset is more likely to happen in
electrically noisy environments. Some computers may also provide power
management to the PS/2 port; this in effect cause the mouse to reset.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.1, 3.5 and
3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
