The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you disable the use of DNS for Windows name resolution, you may find that
DNS is still used to resolve names with more than 15 characters or names that
contain a '.' (period).

RESOLUTION
==========

Perform the following steps to successfully disable the use of DNS for Windows
name resolution:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click Network.

2. Click the Protocols tab, click TCP/IP Protocol, and then click Properties.

3. Click the WINS Address tab and then click Enable DNS For Windows Resolution
   so that it is not selected.

4. Click the DNS tab, remove any servers listed in the DNS Service Search Order
   dialog box, and then click OK.

5. Shut down and restart the computer.

NOTE: If DNS servers are needed for DNS lookups you can now reenter them in the
DNS Service Search Order dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
