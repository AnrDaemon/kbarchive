-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect from one Windows NT computer to another Windows NT computer
using TCP/IP over Point to Point Protocol (PPP), the following error may occur:

   Error: Checking network protocol connection TCPIP reported error 736:
   The remote computer terminated the control protocol.

When you press F1 for more information on error 736, you find that a PPP network
control protocol conversation was started, but was terminated at the request of
the remote computer.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT PPP server is configured to allocate TCP/IP addresses using
dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP), but there is no DHCP server on the
network.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this error, perform one of the following steps:

 - Install a DHCP server on the network.

   NOTE: Verify that the DHCP server has a scope that includes IP addresses on
   the same subnet as that of the network adapter in the Remote Access Service
   (RAS) server.

   -or-

 - Configure the RAS server to use a pool of IP addresses for PPP instead of
   DHCP for PPP clients.

   -or-

 - Remove TCP/IP from the RAS server.
