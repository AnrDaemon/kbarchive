TITLE   :WINMSD Reports Incorrect Free Space on 4.1-GB NTFS Volume
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If you create a 4.1-gigabyte (GB) Windows NT File System (NTFS) volume on a
computer running Windows NT 3.51, the WINMSD utility drive details section
incorrectly reports the free space on a volume that is 4.1 GB or greater.

NOTE: This problem is also likely to occur in Windows NT 3.51; however, Microsoft
has not tested this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The drive details section of WINMSD calculates the free, used, and total space
of the volume as 32-bit integers. This causes the numbers to "wrap around" when
the volume size is larger than 4.099 GB in size. This causes the reported space
of the volume to be smaller than the actual space available. The reported space
will be the difference between 4.099 GB and the actual space available on the
volume.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available. This problem has been resolved in
Windows NT version 4.0
