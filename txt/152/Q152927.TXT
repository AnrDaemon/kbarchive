TITLE   :XADM: Event ID 136 Created When Importing Duplicate Alias
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard to migrate a Microsoft Mail
account to Microsoft Exchange and tell it to create a new Windows NT account, if
the NT account that the Wizard tries to create already exists, it will re-use
the account. In addition, the new Microsoft Exchange account's E-mail address
will have a number appended to the end. This number will begin at 2 and will
increase each time that NT account is re- used. No error or warning messages
will be displayed but Event ID 136 will be written to the Windows NT Event Log
and the description will be:

   A Windows NT account for user User_name already exists.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word

MORE INFORMATION
================

The fix will log additional information in the Windows NT Event Viewer
Application log to help administrators identify if users with the same Directory
Name have been assigned the same Windows NT Domain account. The additional
information will be logged when a Microsoft Exchange user is created and the
Migration Wizard is told to auto-create a Windows NT Domain account. If the
Windows NT account already exists, it will be assigned to the Mailbox that is
being created. The Event ID will still be 136 but the new description will be:

Windows NT Account Domain_name\User_name already exists and was set as
the Primary Windows NT account for Mailbox Directory_name.
