TITLE   :BUG: Small Left Grid Partition Leaves Scroll Bar Remnants
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When partitioning a grid object, remnants of the vertical scroll bar appear
outside of the grid on the left side. This may happen when the size of the left
partition of a grid is changed manually or if the partition size is changed
programmatically. In either case, this will happen if the left partition is
small, about 1/8 of an inch.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only known workaround is to hide the form and then unhide it. For instance,
the following code could be placed in a Command button on the form that the grid
is on:

      ThisForm.Visible=.F.
      ThisForm.Visible=.T.

However, the form will have to redraw and this will be visible to the user.
Changing the Visible property of the grid will not clear up the Scrollbar
remnants.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Partition property of a grid splits it into two panels if the property is
set to a number greater than zero. The number specifies where the grid is split
relative to the left edge of the grid.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Type the following commands in the Visual FoxPro Command window:

      OPEN DATA HOME()+"Samples:Data:Testdata"
      CREATE FORM

2. Add the Customer table from the Testdata database to the data environment of
   the form.

3. With the form's data environment still open, grab the table's Titlebar and
   drag it onto the new form to create a grid.

4. Resize the form and grid as appropriate.

5. Set the Partition property of the grid to 10.

6. Save and run the form. Note the portion of the vertical Scrollbar outside of
   the grid on the left side. Resize the partition so the left side is larger by
   using the mouse and the thick black bar in the bottom left of the grid. Note
   that the scroll bar remnants remain.

7. Click the Visual FoxPro desktop to hide the form. Then reselect the form from
   the bottom of the Window menu. Note that the scroll bar remnants are gone.
