SYMPTOMS
========

The following sequence of operations generates a general protection fault (GPF)
in the target Windows NT Virtual MS-DOS Machine (VDM) :

1. In ControlPanel, double-click the International icon and change the Keyboard
   Layout to something other than US (French, German, Spanish, UK, and so
   forth).

2. Open a Windows NT VDM window.

3. Start a 16-bit application, such as edit file.txt.

4. Press the SCROLL_LOCK/UNLOCK key once or twice.

This generates a GPF in the VDM.

NOTE : the problem does not happen with Keyboard Layout set to US.


RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to Windows NT 4.0, or obtain the fix referenced below.

In the absence of side-effects, a solution will be included in Windows NT 3.51
Service Pack 5. The problem is also fixed in Windows NT version 4.0. The file
concerned is Ntvdm.exe

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 Service
Packs 1 through 4.
