TITLE   :XFOR: Moving Messages Between Folders Fails to Delete Original
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to move a message or messages from any folder within the
Microsoft Exchange 4.0 Client to another folder, the following error message
appears:

   The item could not be moved. The action could not be completed.

WORKAROUND
==========

No workaround is required. The message is actually copied to the destination
selected, however the delete action on the original message failed. If the
original message is manually deleted all is fine, however this action should not
be required by the user. The original message should be deleted automatically by
the Exchange Client itself.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
