SUMMARY
=======

When you perform a Microsoft Exchange directory import, you might receive the
following error:

   One warning event was encountered but not logged.
   No errors were encountered.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you encounter errors during the directory import, a file will be created with
the same name as your import file with an extension of .err. If subsequent
imports report errors using the same file, the extension will be e01, e02, and
so forth. Import will record the lines with which it had problems in this text
file. It can be edited and then used as your import file.
