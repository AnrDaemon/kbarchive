-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Custom AppWizards with some custom steps do not pick up initialization values
for the dialog's controls for these steps from the Resource Editor.

For instance, if the custom step's dialog template contains a Combo Box, the
strings for the Combo Box can be entered in the Resource Editor itself. When the
Wizard is built and run, and when the custom step containing the Combo Box comes
up, the strings don't show up in the Combo Box. The same also happens with a
picture control with a bitmap associated with it.

CAUSE
=====

For the custom step dialog boxes, Custom AppWizards ignore any initialization
information setup in the Resource Editor.


RESOLUTION
==========

Each custom step's dialog template has a corresponding CAppWizStepDlg- derived
class. The necessary initialization should be done in this class's OnInitDialog
member function. Because this function is called before the dialog is visible to
the user, the effect is as if the initializations were done in the Resource
Editor.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Custom AppWizards are of three types with only two of these types supporting
custom dialog steps. The problem discussed in this article shows up in both
these types.

Sample Code
-----------

      BOOL CCustomDialog::OnInitDialog()
      {
          CAppWizStepDlg::OnInitDialog();
          // Initialize the combo box
          CComboBox* pCombo = (CComboBox* )GetDlgItem(IDC_COMBO);
          pCombo->AddString("Hello");
          pCombo->AddString("World");
          // Initialize the picture control
          m_Bitmap.LoadBitmap(IDB_MYBITMAP);
          CStatic* pStatic = (CStatic* )GetDlgItem(IDC_PICSTATIC);
          pStatic->SetBitmap(m_Bitmap);
          return TRUE;
      }
