SUMMARY
=======

This article provides a description of The Magic School Bus Explores Inside the
Earth.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Fun is just a stone's throw away, especially when you're traveling with the
Friz, that fantastic teacher with the wacky wardrobe who can make anything
happen. This time she's simply mad about minerals. Hold onto your socks - it's
time to dig in and learn about rocks.

In this Magic School Bus adventure, you'll be transported through six geographic
regions via a bus that's either an Airplane or a Digger.

Each environment you visit has its own games, experiments, and activities.
Whenever you start something new, the Friz or one of your companions will be
right there to help you. And as you experiment and play, don't let those missing
rocks get away.

Arnold's rock collection is missing a few rocks and minerals, and your job is to
find the ones that are missing. To find out what's missing, click an empty space
in Arnold's collection. Listen to the clues for hints on finding the missing
rock or mineral. When you find it, you can add it to Arnold's rock collection,
and you're on your way to being a Master Rock Hound.

If you're not sure what kind of rock or mineral you've found, take it to the Geo
Table. You can scratch it, wash it, magnify it, and test it until it gives up
all its secrets.

When you're in the bus, be sure to go to the back of the bus and check out the
Rock Transformer. You can transform obsidian into arrowheads or change
toothpaste back into fluorite. Here's your chance to see what rocks and minerals
can be.

And, you can actually create rocks in Ralphie's Earth Kitchen. Read the recipes,
and then get cooking.

When you've found all the rocks and minerals, you're a Master Rock Hound.

The Magic School Bus Explores Inside the Earth is designed for kids of all ages,
especially those 6-10. The program is based on a series of books from Scholastic
publishing, one of the leading publishers of kids books.
