TITLE   :XCLN: MAC Client Can't Open Attachments from Migrated MAC PO
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you use the Macintosh Source Extractor to migrate a Microsoft Mail for
Appletalk Networks Postoffice to a Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0, you
might not be able to double-click to open attachments on mail messages in the
Macintosh mail client. You will receive the following error message for text
attachments:

   Can't get the time stamp of <your computer>:System Folder:Exchange
   Temporary Items:<attachment name>. Microsoft Exchange will assume it is
   dirty.

After you click OK, you will receive the following error message:

   The application associated with this attachment could not be started.
   <attachment name> (System Error = -43)".

When you close the message containing the attachment, you will receive the
following error message:

   The temporary file has disappeared. Changes could not be saved.

There is no error message for executable attachments. When double- clicked, they
create a new message and attach themselves to it. If you double-click this new
icon, you will get another message with the attachment but it will have a 1, an
@ symbol, and an umlauted A appended to its name. If you double-click each new
icon, this behavior will continue.

CAUSE
=====

The properties of the message show that PR_ATTACH_ENCODING is not set to
OID_MAC_BINARY by the source extractor.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, save the attachment and then run Stuffit to decode
it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
