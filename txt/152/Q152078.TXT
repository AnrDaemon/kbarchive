Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

In some cases you may not be able to determine which option Windows NT is
running in through the normal UI or the NET ACCOUNTS command.

Windows NT has the following possible options:

Windows NT Workstation
Windows NT Server
Windows NT primary domain controller
Windows NT backup domain controller

Through the use of REGEDT32.EXE you can verify the role of the installed Windows
NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

Using REGEDT32.EXE, find the following registry entry.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ProductOptions\ 
   ProductType

ProductType can be one of the following:

WinNT = Windows NT workstation
LanmanNT = Windows NT Server domain controller (primary or backup)
ServerNT = Windows NT Server stand-alone


On Special Editions of Windows NT the ProductSuite key exists and can be the
following values:

Terminal Server = Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition
Enterprise = Windows NT Server 4.0 Enterprise Edition

Do not change any of this information under any circumstances. Changes to these
values may result in the failure of the Windows NT operating system.
