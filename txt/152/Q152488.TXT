TITLE   :Event 7000: File Not Found with SMS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory kbPCM smsinv smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following two entries are present in the System Log of a system running
Windows NT Server within an SMS site:

   The SMS_INVENTORY_AGENT_NT service failed to start due to the following
   error:
   The system cannot find the file specified.

   The SMS_PACKAGE_COMMAND_MANAGER_NT service failed to start due to the
   following error:
   The system cannot find the file specified.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the server components for the platform (I386 and Alpha)
that generated the error message are not installed. For example, if the SMS site
server has an Alpha processor, the Alpha server and client components will be
installed by default. However, the I386 and MIPS files will not. The server
components will then be propagated to all the SMS logon servers in the site. If
any of these are non-Alpha, they will generate the error message because the
correct files do not exist in the SMS\site.srv\<platform>.bin directories
on the SMS site server or in the SMS\helper.srv\<platform>.bin directories
on the logon servers (actually the correct <platform.bin> directories
don't exist at all).

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the SMS Setup Program and choose Add Components. From the list box, choose
Add and the correct platform components. (For example, Intel Server Components.)
This will create an \SMS\site.srv\x86.bin directory and copy the needed files.
