 - Microsoft Complete Gardening for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Complete Gardening does not include the "Garden Bed Planner" feature
mentioned in the "Smart Gardening by CD-ROM" article in Microsoft Magazine.

This feature was a preliminary idea for Complete Gardening, but was not developed
and is not included in the program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The June/July 1996 issue of Microsoft Magazine contains an article describing a
"Garden Bed Planner" feature in Complete Gardening. The following is an excerpt
from the article:

   By using the Garden Bed Planner, you can be more efficient and make sure
   you're going to end up with the garden you want by planning the garden
   onscreen and seeing plants change as they grow and mature from season to
   season - even before you have planted a single seed.

The article also contains a screen shot of Microsoft Complete Gardening showing
an option to "Add to Garden Bed Planner".
