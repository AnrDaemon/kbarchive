-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a NetWare 3.x server from a Windows 95 client, and the
NetWare login script has been configured to run Smsls.scr, a fatal exception
error occurs during the "Installing Systems Management Server on this client . .
" phase.

CAUSE
=====

McAfee's VirusScan for Windows 95 is installed and VShield is configured to load
at startup. Vshield causes the fatal exception error on Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

From the McAfee VirusScan95 group, run the VShield Configuration Manager. In the
General section of the Detection tab, disable the "Load VShield at startup"
option. You can create a shortcut to Vshwin32.exe and place it in StartUp, so
that VShield continues to load automatically.
