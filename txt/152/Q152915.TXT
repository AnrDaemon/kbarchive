TITLE   :XFOR: Messages Inbound from IMC Include Body as Attachment
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Microsoft Exchange Service Pack 2 to a Microsoft Exchange Server
running the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC), the message body
of an incoming message might appear as an attachment.

CAUSE
=====

When MIME encoded messages are received by the IMC with a Content-Type of
Text/Plain and a parameter of Name= following it, the message body text is
converted to an attachment with the name given in the Name= parameter.

For example:

   Date: 8 Aug 1996 12:56:10 -0400
   From: "User One" <User1@your.domain.name.here.edu>
   Subject: Mail test from QM
   To: "My Friend" <myfriend@his.domain.name.here.com>
   Mime-Version: 1.0
   Content-Type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"; Name="Message Body"
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
   Subject:Mail test

   mail test from QM

When you open the message, the actual message body is in an attachment called
Message Body.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
