TITLE   :BUG: VFP Does Not Redraw Correctly After Resolution Change
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenvkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When changing resolutions with the Monitor control panel, Visual FoxPro
development environment may not correctly redraw the environment. Windows may
have blank, overwritten, or misaligned areas. Toolbars may be docked or
positioned incorrectly. This behavior can occur regardless of the tool used to
change resolutions.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only reliable workaround at this time is to quit and then relaunch Visual
FoxPro. Visual FoxPro correctly polls the system at launch time and will respect
the resolution chosen.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

3. Launch Visual FoxPro.

4. Drag the Command window to near the right edge of the monitor.

5. Without quitting Visual FoxPro, change resolution to 640x480.

6. Return to Visual FoxPro.
