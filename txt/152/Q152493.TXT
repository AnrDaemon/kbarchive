======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - The AppWizard, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Generating an ISAPI Filter using the MFC ISAPI Extension Wizard and selecting
the option "Client Authentication Requests," will generate an ISAPI Filter DLL
with an OnAuthentication() member function that will never be called.

CAUSE
=====

When generating an ISAPI Filter using the MFC ISAPI Extension Wizard, if the
"Client Authentication Requests" checkbox is selected on the second page of the
Wizard, the function generated, OnAuthentication(), will have an improper type
as one of its parameters. Therefore, it will not override the virtual function
in the base class.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the definition and implementation of the OnAuthentication function so the
second parameter is of type PHTTP_FILTER_AUTHENT rather than type
PHTTP_FILTER_PREPROC_HEADERS.

The definition of the OnAuthentication function will look like the following in
the .H file:

      DWORD OnAuthentication(CHttpFilterContext* pCtxt,
          PHTTP_FILTER_PREPROC_HEADERS pHeaderInfo);

and like the following in the .CPP file:

      DWORD CMyFilter::OnAuthentication(CHttpFilterContext* pCtxt,
          PHTTP_FILTER_PREPROC_HEADERS pHeaderInfo)

The second parameter should not be PHTTP_FILTER_PREPROC_HEADERS, but should read
PHTTP_FILTER_AUTHENT. For example:

      DWORD OnAuthentication(CHttpFilterContext* pCtxt,
          PHTTP_FILTER_AUTHENT pHeaderInfo);

in the .H file, and:

      DWORD CMyFilter::OnAuthentication(CHttpFilterContext* pCtxt,
          PHTTP_FILTER_AUTHENT pHeaderInfo)

in the .CPP file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was fixed in Visual C++ 32-bit Edition
version 4.2.
