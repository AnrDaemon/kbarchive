The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you use the SNA Server 16-bit or 32-bit Windows APPC interface, the
APPC transaction program ID (TP_ID) and conversation ID (CONV_ID)
parameters are only valid from the Windows process (or task) that created
them. For example, if a 16-bit Windows APPC application receives a TP_ID by
calling TP_STARTED, and a CONV_ID by calling [MC_]ALLOCATE, the TP_ID and
CONV_ID are invalid if used by a different 16-bit Windows process. If
another process tries to use these parameters when calling the APPC
interface, the following APPC errors will occur:

   primary_rc = AP_PARAMETER_CHECK (0x0001)
   secondary_rc = AP_BAD_TP_ID (0x00000001)

   primary_rc = AP_PARAMETER_CHECK (0x0001)
   secondary_rc = AP_BAD_CONV_ID (0x00000002)

SNA Server 32-bit Windows applications that call TP_STARTED and
[MC_]ALLOCATE may appear to receive the same TP_ID and CONV_ID values.
However, the underlying SNA Server APPC interface recognizes these values
as unique because they are created by different process IDs.
