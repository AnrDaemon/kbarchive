TITLE   :XADM: Viewing Event Viewer Files On Other Computers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you review Windows NT Event Viewer files on a different computer than the
file was originally created on, you might see the following as part of the
description:

   The description for Event ID ( XXX ) in Source ( YYY ) could not be found. It
   contains the following insertion string(s): ZZZ

where XXX is the actual number for the event id, YYY is the service source name
that logged the error, and YYY can be any string of data.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The above text appears when the Event Viewer cannot find the source file for the
actual description of a message (usually a DLL). It can also occur when the
message was generated by an installed service which is part of another
component.

This problem is very common when viewing event log entries for instances of the
Microsoft Exchange PCMTA. For example, if there is a particular Microsoft
Exchange Server that has the MSMail Connector installed and has an instance of
PCMTA called "MTA to Vancouver PO", and you try to view event log entries for
this PCMTA on a different computer that does not have an instance with this same
name, you will see the above description.

WORKAROUND
==========

On a computer that has the MSMail Connector installed, create a temporary
instance of "MTA to Vancouver PO". There is no need to configure or start the
service.

-or-

Close and reopen the event viewer on the remote computer to refresh the screen.
