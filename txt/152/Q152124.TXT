SYMPTOMS
========

The USR-Megahertz 288 Ethernet Combo card XJ/CCEM3288 is configured by default
to function correctly on COM3 with Windows NT version 3.51. When the Combo card
is configured for any other COM port, the LAN portion of the Combo card
functions, but the MODEM may not. The Combo card configuration can be verified
by looking in the Ethernet configuration window.

CAUSE
=====

SERIAL.SYS and PCMCIA.SYS do not properly configure and share interrupts for
this card.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, you must either:

 - Reconfigure the card to use COM3 only -or-

 - Replace your PCMCIA.SYS and SERIAL.SYS files with the fixed versions provided
   by Microsoft. Instructions for downloading this fix are included below.
