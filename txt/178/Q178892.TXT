TITLE   :XADM: DMS-Latest Delivery Settings Not Effective
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message using an Outlook client, in the case of the Defense
Messaging System (DMS) version of Exchange, clients sending messages by virtue
of DMS client extensions have an option for setting latest delivery. This option
is not available with the existing standard product clients, because it requires
the extensions for the related property pages. With this option, messages can be
sent with delivery options set with the "At any time" but "No later than"
condition. When the time for delivery expires, the expected behavior is a
non-delivery report (NDR) from the remote message transfer agent (MTA) with
"Delivery Time Expired" as the diagnostic code. However, the message is
delivered even after the delivery time has expired.

CAUSE
=====

The cause is that the latest delivery time is not being implemented, either for
local delivery or for giving to the MTA.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
