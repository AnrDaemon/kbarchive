SYMPTOMS
========

When performing a mail merge in Word 97, toolbars and custom icons may either be
moved from their normal location or may fail to display in the current
document.

Case 1
------

When performing a mail merge, Word 97 will try to automatically dock the Mail
Merge toolbar in the third position, below the Standard and Formatting toolbars
(if only one of these toolbars is displayed, the Mail Merge toolbar will be
docked in the second position).

All other docked toolbars may either be moved to the right of or below the Mail
Merge toolbar. When the mail merge is complete, Word may not automatically
restore the moved toolbars to their previous locations.

Case 2
------

When creating a mail merge document based on a custom template that contains a
custom toolbar, the custom toolbar may not be displayed in the new merge
document (for example, this problem will occur with Form Letter 1). This problem
will not occur if the custom toolbar is saved in the Normal template.

In both of these cases, this is new behavior from the previous version of Word,
which inserts the Mail Merge toolbar below all existing toolbars and displays
all custom toolbars.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
