TITLE   :XADM: Full Online Backup Fails with Event ID 15 with Error -1811
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During a full online backup and after the Exchange Server directory has been
backed up, Windows NT backup stops, with the following error messages written to
the event viewer when it begins to back up the information store.

   Event ID: 15
   Source: EDB
   Description: MSExchangeIS ((190)) The database engine has stopped the backup
   with error -1811.

   Event ID: 105
   Source: ESE97
   Type: Error
   Category: Logging/Recovery
   Description: MSExchangeIS ((202) ) The database engine has stopped the backup
   with error -1811.

WORKAROUND
==========

Error -1811 is JET_errFileNotFound. The error above signals that a transaction
log file is either missing or corrupt. Perform the following steps to work
around this problem:

1. Stop the Information Store service.

2. Remove all the .LOG files from the \Exchsrvr\Mdbdata directory, and place
   them in a temporary directory.

3. Find the Edb.chk file (located in the \Exchsrvr\Mdbdata directory on one of
   the drives), and place it in the temporary directory.

4. Start the Information Store service.

5. Start the full online backup of the Exchange Server again.

Result: The full online backup should complete without error.
