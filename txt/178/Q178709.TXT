TITLE   :XFOR: Internet Mail Service Is Not Properly Encoding Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) messages are not being encoded properly
when senders send messages to recipients using Rich Text Format. The messages
are being delivered in Raw Text.

CAUSE
=====

The code that scans for 8-bit characters in the Subject string has a logic error
such that if the only 8-bit character in the string is the last character, the
code does not detect it as such. When "UseRTFText" is true, the stream passed to
rcScan() to scan for 8-bit characters is the incorrect stream.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

Many content types are natively formatted as 8-bit character or binary data.
Data formatted in this way cannot be sent using SMTP, RFC-821, as the transport
protocol. As mentioned earlier, RFC-821 limits messages to 7-bit US-ASCII with
lines no longer than 1,000 characters. So, a method for encoding such data as
7-bit US-ASCII is needed. The encoding formats do not describe the data itself,
but only the encoding used to transport the data.
