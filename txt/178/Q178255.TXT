TITLE   :SNA Server May Fail to Log Event 624 and Create Snadump.log
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When SNA Server or an SNA application ends abnormally due to an access violation
or internal breakpoint, SNA Server normally logs an Event 624 and produces an
Snadump.log file in the <snaroot>\traces directory, to assist support
personnel in diagnosing problems. In some cases, SNA Server fails to log an
Event 624 and produce an Snadump.log file.


CAUSE
=====

In some cases, the SNA Server exception handling code was failing to produce an
<snaroot>\traces\snadump.log following an access violation or unhandled
exception in an SNA Server module.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 (including SP1
and SP2).

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
