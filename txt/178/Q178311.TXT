TITLE   :XADM: Error Running ISINTEG on a Cluster Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Isinteg -patch on a Microsoft Cluster Server, you may receive the
following error message:

   The private store could not be updated
   Reason: JET_errKeyDuplicate

WORKAROUND
==========

Before you run the Isinteg -patch command on a Microsoft Exchange Server
computer that is running on a Microsoft Cluster Server, you must set the
environment variable _CLUSTER_NETWORK_NAME_ to the Exchange Resource Group
network name. For example, if your Exchange Resource Group network name is
EXCLUSTER, type the following at the command prompt (all uppercase)

   SET _CLUSTER_NETWORK_NAME_=<IP ADDRESS NAME>

where <IP ADDRESS NAME> is the name assigned to the IP Address resource in
the Exchange Resource Group. This is essentially the NetBIOS name of the
Exchange Server computer. It is found using Cluster Admin\Exchange Resource
Group\Exchange Cluster Network Name\Properties\Parameters.
