SUMMARY
=======

The appearance of the ambiguity indicator on the Cessna aircraft instrument
panel in Flight Simulator 98/2000 is different from the Cessna ambiguity
indicator in earlier versions of Flight Simulator.

The ambiguity indicator displays your position relative to the station and the
radial that you have selected with the omni-bearing selector (OBS). The
ambiguity indicator also indicates whether you are receiving a usable navigation
signal.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you receive a usable navigation signal, the ambiguity indicator (the
triangle located beside the small letters "NAV" near the bottom of the VOR 1
Indicator gauge) points up or down. The up position indicates that the OBS is
set to a radial leading toward the very high frequency omnidirectional range
(VOR) signal. The up position on the ambiguity indicator is the same as the TO
indicator in earlier versions of Flight Simulator.

The down position on the ambiguity indicator indicates that the OBS is set to a
radial leading away from the VOR signal. The down position on the ambiguity
indicator is the same as the FROM indicator in earlier versions of Flight
Simulator.

If the ambiguity indicator is striped, the gauge is not receiving a usable
navigation signal. A striped ambiguity indicator is the same as the OFF
indicator in earlier versions of Flight Simulator.
