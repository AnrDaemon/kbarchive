SUMMARY
=======

The Server Scripting extension is installed by default with Microsoft Outlook
version 8.03. This extension allows a Microsoft Outlook user to manage scripts
that are used on a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 computer. This extension is
normally listed in the Add-ins dialog box when installed properly. In some
cases, the extension and its functionality may not be available and it must be
reinstalled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you remove the extension via the Add-in Manager, it cannot be reinstalled
again from the Add-in Manager. To reinstall the extension, you must perform the
following steps:

1. Run the Microsoft Outlook Setup program.

2. Choose the Add/Remove option.

3. Under Microsoft Exchange Server Support, disable the Exchange Scripting Agent
   option.

4. Repeat the steps above to enable the Exchange Scripting Agent option. This
   will reinstall any missing or corrupt files or Registry settings.

The Server Scripting extension should now be visible in the Add-in Manager.
