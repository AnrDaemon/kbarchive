TITLE   :XCLN: OLE Objects Do Not Display Correctly on Macintosh Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:8.0 WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to view an embedded OLE object in the Macintosh client that
originated from a Windows client, you may not see the object or may see an
object with questions marks.

CAUSE
=====

This is a current limitation of OLE between Windows and the Macintosh. Bitmap
images are native to Windows environments and not the Macintosh. From the
Exchange 5.0 Macintosh release Notes, Section 1.10: "When sending messages
containing embedded OLE objects between Windows and Macintosh platforms, the
embedded object may not display correctly when you open the file."

WORKAROUND
==========

One possible workaround is to attach the graphic to the message, rather than
embedding it. This usually works because attachments are different from embedded
objects.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the above listed versions of
Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

Additional query words: bitmap cut copy paste graphics image
