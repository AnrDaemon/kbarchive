TITLE   :XWEB: RecvTextA Interface for Channel Service Is Broken
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Commercial Internet System version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs with the Chat Service. The RecvTextA interface for channel
services is broken for IRC/IRCX connections. It still works with MIC. For
example, you have a Channel Service that watches for profanity in messages. A
RecvTextA call is made for every message sent by an MIC user, but it is not
generated if the user sending the message is using either IRC or IRCX.

CAUSE
=====

The Channel services RecVTextA() call is not called from the IRC client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a limitation in Microsoft Internet Chat
Server version 2.0 that can affect Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
