SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange and Outlook clients now support the additional RFC822 one-off
addresses in the following forms:

   John Smith <JSMITH@XYZ.COM>
   John Smith <"<John>Smith"@XYZ.COM>
   <JSMITH@XYZ.COM>

MORE INFORMATION
================

These additional addressing forms are only available as one-off addresses. PAB
SMTP addresses still need to be entered as follows:

   Display Name: John Smith
   Email Address: JSMITH@XYZ.COM

The new SMTP parsing code is only invoked when an SMTP address has been entered
as a one-off on the "TO" line and a "check names" is performed.

When a one-off address similar to:

   John Smith <JSMITH@XYZ.COM>

has been entered on the "TO" line, the one-off address will be parsed as
follows:

   Display Name: John Smith <JSMITH@XYZ.COM>
   Email Address: JSMITH@XYZ.COM
   Address Type: SMTP
