The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.0, versions Build 2.73.7269, Build 2.73.7283.03, Build 2.73.7356 
 - Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.5 Build 2.573.2927 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.5, 2.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Oracle databases authenticate users that are logged on with SQL*Net
Authentication services. This service works fine for users logged into Oracle
through SQLPlus; however, when the logged on user is a service like Internet
Information Server, the authentication fails with the following error:

   [Microsoft][ODBC driver for Oracle][Oracle]ORA-12641: TNS:authentication
   service failed to initialize

CAUSE
=====

This is a known limitation of SQL*Net Authentication.

RESOLUTION
==========

The problem may be corrected by editing the Sqlnet.ora file. This configuration
file is usually stored in the Network/Admin subdirectory of the Oracle Home
directory. The following line needs to be added to this file:

   SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES = (none)

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
