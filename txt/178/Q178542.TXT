SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Diplomacy button while you are playing Microsoft Age of
Empires, your computer may stop responding (hang).

RESOLUTION
==========

You may be able to resolve this issue by reducing the graphics hardware
acceleration. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click Graphics.

4. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider until it is one notch to the right of
   None (the Basic acceleration setting).

5. Click OK, and then click Close.

6. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

If these steps resolve the issue, repeat these steps to increase the graphics
hardware acceleration by moving the Hardware Acceleration slider one notch to
the right (the Most acceleration setting) in step 4. If the problem returns,
move the slider back to the Basic acceleration setting.
