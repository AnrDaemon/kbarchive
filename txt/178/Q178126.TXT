The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using a Windows NT SNA Server Client configured to use TCP/IP sockets
connection against SNA Server, the client will try to using named pipes if the
TCP connection fails. This behavior may need to changed in order to prevent
extra network traffic. The use of named pipes may result in extra network
traffic. For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q128985 Comparing SNA client TCP/IP named pipes vs sockets

One sign that the client has switched to named pipes is if the initial client
connection takes 45 to 60 seconds to complete. This is usually the time required
for the default TCP/IP retry timers to expire.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.1, 2.11
SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following

Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
