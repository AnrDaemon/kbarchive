SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the VOR2 gauge in the LearJet 45 and Boeing
737-400.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Location of the VOR2 Needle
---------------------------

In the LearJet, at the bottom of the panel containing the Horizontal Situation
Indicator (HSI), you see several knobs and switches. When you move the pointer
over the leftmost switch, the pointer changes to a hand, and the label Toggle
VOR2 Needle appears below the pointer. Click once to display the VOR2 needle
inside the HSI.

In the 737-400, the VOR2 needle is displayed in the Radio Magnetic Indicator
(Dual Needle RMI) which is just to the left of the HSI.

OBS Course
----------

The OBS course for VOR2 in both the LearJet and the 737 have no impact on the
display of the VOR2 needle. In addition, the OBS course cannot be adjusted in
the 737; it retains the current settings when you select the airplane. If you
change the OBS course setting before you select the 737, the VOR2 needle in the
Radio Magnetic Indicator (RMI) remains unchanged, even though the OBS course
setting is different.
