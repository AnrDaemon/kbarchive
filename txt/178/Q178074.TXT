TITLE   :RUI_TERM Fails to Return When lua_resv56[2] Is Set in RUI_INIT
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An RUI (LUA)-based application may not be able to establish a session between
SSCP and a specified LU using RUI_INIT after previously issuing an RUI_TERM on
the same LU. The RUI_INIT request may return with a
STATE_CHECK_DUPLICATE-RUI_INIT message, which can be observed in an SNA LUA API
trace. The symptoms described here may occur when you use either the 16- bit or
32-bit version of the WINRUI libraries.

CAUSE
=====

The RUI_TERM does not work correctly when the lua_resv56[2] option is set in the
RUI_INIT. Setting lua_resv56[2] to a non-zero value means that the RUI library
will not drop the LU-SSCP connection to the node unless the application
specifically asks it to do so by issuing an RUI_TERM.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
Service Pack 1, 3.0 Service Pack 2, and 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

WORKAROUND
==========

The RUI application should set all reserved bits in the verb control block to
NULL prior to calling the RUI interface, unless specific bits are purposely
being set in the lua_resv56 byte when calling RUI_INIT.
