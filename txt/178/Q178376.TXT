TITLE   :XCON: Local Address Space Replicated to Other Sites
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Setting the address space for an X.400 Connector to LOCAL on an Exchange Server
5.0 computer has no effect in preventing replication of the routing table.
Setting the Address Space Restrictions to This Site or This Location on an
Exchange Server 5.5 computer, which should achieve the same effect as LOCAL,
does not prevent the replication. The routing table is still replicated to other
sites though it should not be.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
