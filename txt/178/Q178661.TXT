   1. On the Apple menu, point to Control Panels and click TCP/IP.

   2. Click the Options button in the bottom right corner of the TCP/IP window
      and verify that Make TCP/IP is set to Active and the Load Only When Needed
      option is not enabled.

   3. Click OK. On the File menu, click Exit to close the TCP/IP window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you choose to work around this problem by obtaining the hotfix, be aware that
the Invmac.mac file is compressed, so you must use Hdecomp.exe (found in the
Support directory of the Systems Management Server 1.2 CD) to expand it. Expand
the file to a user authentication module (UAM) volume, and place it in the
Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\Mac.bin directory of each site server. Macintosh
clients must run the Systems Management Server Installer script to get the
updated Invmac.mac file. Note that Hdecomp.exe requires Smsunzip.dll to work
properly.
