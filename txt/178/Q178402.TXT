======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.03 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Quickly determining whether an installed version of Outlook 8.03 is the North
American 64-bit security encryption version or the exportable version may be of
importance to many customers. From an appearance and client functionality
standpoint, there is no visible difference.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because of U.S. export laws, 64-bit versions of the advanced security file
(Etexch32.dll) are only available for North American English (Eng.na) and French
(Frn.na). These languages are supported for use only in the United States and
Canada.

To determine which type of encryption your advanced security file (Etexch32.dll)
currently supports, in the Microsoft Exchange Client or Microsoft Outlook
Client, on the Tools menu, click Options, and then click Security. This dialog
box provides information that indicates whether the client is using the
International (exportable version) or the North American-only version of
encryption.

Additionally, the version can be determined without opening the client in the
Windows 95 or Windows NT Explorer. Select the Etexch32.dll file. Right- click on
the file and choose Properties and select the Version tab. Information in this
property page lists the description of the file as Export version, or US/Canada
Only, Not for Export. The latter of these two will contain the 64-bit security
encryption.
