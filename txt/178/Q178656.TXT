TITLE   :XWEB: VBScript Error When Attempting to Access a Mailbox
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following VBScript error may appear when you try to access a mailbox on an
Exchange Server computer via Outlook Web Access (OWA):

   Microsoft VBScript runtime error '800a03e3'

   Unknown runtime error

   /exchange/USA/lib/session.inc, line 300"

The script name and line number may be different from the above, but the error
code will remain the same.

CAUSE
=====

This error may be caused if anonymous access is not enabled on the Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) in the Exchange Administrator program, or if
the anonymous account has not been assigned the correct permissions, or both.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

1. From the Exchange Server Administrator program, view the properties of the
   LDAP and ensure that Allow Anonymous is checked.

2. View the properties of the directory service Site Configuration container and
   ensure the account designated for the anonymous access is correct and that
   the password for this account is correct. NOTE: the IUSR_servername account
   is normally used for anonymous access; however, it is possible to use a
   different account name.

3. View the properties of the Configuration container and changes to the
   permissions tab. Ensure that the IUSR_servername or anonymous account has
   search permissions.

If any of the above changes have been made, you must stop and restart the World
Wide Web Publishing Service via Control Panel/Services.
