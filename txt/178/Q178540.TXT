TITLE   :XCON: Viewing Embedded Message Displays Compose Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you open an embedded message attachment in a message from another Exchange
Server computer sent via an X.400 Connector, the message compose window may be
displayed. This prevents you from replying to the embedded message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the X.400 Connectors between the Exchange Server
computers have the "Remote Clients support MAPI" setting disabled on the General
tab of the X.400 Connector properties.

When this setting is disabled, the message is converted from the Exchange native
format to an X.400 format for message delivery. The MAPI message flags are not
properly retained on the embedded message during conversion. This, in turn,
causes Exchange to treat the message as a saved unsent message and opens in
compose mode.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, go to the General tab of the X.400 Connector
property page on both Exchange Server computers and select the "Remote Clients
support MAPI" check box. Then restart the message transfer agent (MTA) service
on both servers.

This is the default setting for the X.400 Connector. The default setting should
always be enabled when the X.400 Connector is communicating between Exchange
Server computers. Disabling this setting is intended for communication between
Exchange and a third-party message transfer agent (MTA).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
