-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Service does not send a non-
delivery report (NDR) on a message it has passed from a custom routing .Dll file
with DISP_NDR_ORIG. The message may be delivered to the mailbox and the
following event ID recorded:

   Event id 2078 from MSExchangeIS Private
   Category: Transfer Out Of Gateway
   Description: Unable to submit, send or transfer out a message. Check
   PR_DELIVERY_TIME, PR_NDR_REASON, PR_NON_DELIVERY_DIAGNOSTIC.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Service will attempt to resolve the
name and deliver the message if a valid address is available in the message. If
the address in the recipient list is not valid, the message transfer agent (MTA)
will send an NDR. If the address is resolved, then the MTA will attempt to
deliver the message.
