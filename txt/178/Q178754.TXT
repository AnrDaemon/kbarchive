SYMPTOMS
========

A form displayed modally does not appear in the taskbar.

RESOLUTION
==========

To have a form appear in the taskbar, show the form as a non-modal form. The
MORE INFORMATION section below shows how to show a form in the taskbar.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By Windows user interface design standards, modal forms do not appear in the
system taskbar. The next section shows you how to create a sample project that
simulates a modal form so that the form appears in the taskbar.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a CommandButton to the Form1 form.

3. Add a second Form to the project. Add a CommandButton to the Form2 form.

4. Copy the following code to the Code window of the Form1 form:

         Option Explicit
         Private Sub Command1_Click()
             Form1.Enabled = False
             Form2.Show
         End Sub

5. Copy the following code to the Code window of the Form2 form:

         Option Explicit
         Private Sub Command1_Click()
             Unload Form2
             Form1.Enabled = True
             Form1.SetFocus
         End Sub

6. On the Run menu, click Start or press the F5 key to start the program. On the
   Form1 form, click the CommandButton to display the Form2 form. Note that the
   Form2 form also appears in the taskbar.
