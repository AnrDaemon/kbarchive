TITLE   :XADM: Open File Backup Backs Up Inconsistent Exchange Databases
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

 

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use backup software that performs a backup of the Exchange Server
database files while the Exchange services are running, the backup of the
databases will be inconsistent. If you restore this backup and attempt to start
the respective Exchange Server services, you will receive the following error
message on the screen, in the Windows NT Event Viewer Application log, or both:

   Error -550 has occurred

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange databases are a combination of the database files (.Edb files) and
the logs (.Log files). All transactions occurring in Exchange Server are written
to the log files first and then written into the actual database files, after a
period of time.

The Exchange databases are considered to be consistent when all transactions from
the log files have been written into the database files. The database is then
consistent with the log files. When the information store service is shut down,
all transactions from the log files are written into the information store
service databases (Priv.edb and Pub.edb). When the directory service is shut
down, all transactions from the log files are written into the directory
database (Dir.edb). The only time you can be absolutely certain that an Exchange
Server database is consistent is when its respective service is shut down
without error.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Use backup software that is designed to back up Exchange Server while it is
   online.

   -or-

 - Stop the information store and directory services before you perform a backup
   of the Exchange Server databases.
