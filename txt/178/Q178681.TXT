SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server 3.0 Solution Developer Kit (SDK) documents that ship with
Microsoft BackOffice version 2.5 contain headers that print incorrectly. The

To work around this problem, use InfoViewer, which is installed with the SDK.
All of the documents print correctly from InfoViewer.
