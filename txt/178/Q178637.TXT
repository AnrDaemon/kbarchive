When you start one of the programs listed at the beginning of this article, you
may experience one of the following symptoms:

 - You receive the following error message:

   Error initializing DirectSound.

 - You do not hear any sounds when you run the program.

 - Your computer stops responding (hangs).

Sounds in Windows are played correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the sound driver installed on your computer is not
fully compatible with DirectSound.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact your sound card manufacturer to inquire about how
to obtain and install the latest version of the sound driver is available for
your sound card.

If the latest version of the sound driver for your sound card is already
installed on your computer, you may be able to resolve this issue by using the
Game Compatible audio device, which is associated with certain modems. To
install the Game Compatible audio device:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Modems.

3. Click Add.

4. Click to select the "Don't detect my modem; I will select it from a list"
   check box, and then click Next.

5. In the Manufacturers box, click 3X.

   NOTE: 3X may not be available in some versions of Microsoft Windows.

6. In the Models box, click 3X 14.4 Data Fax Modem Voice.

7. Click Next.

8. Click any port, and then click Next. Follow the instructions on the screen.

9. Click Finish, and then click Close.

After you add the 3X Data Fax Modem Voice modem, set the Game Compatible Device
to be your default audio playback device:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Multimedia.

3. Under Playback, click Game Compatible Device in the Preferred Device box.

4. Click to select the Use Preferred Devices Only check box, and then click OK.
