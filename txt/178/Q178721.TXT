========

When you attempt to open a new profile, you may receive a Check Name dialog box
with the following error message:

   The name could not be resolved. The name could not be matched to a name
   in the address list.

CAUSE
=====

The mailbox alias or name attempting to be resolved has been hidden from the
Exchange Server Address Book.

WORKAROUND
==========

Open the Exchange Administrator program and temporarily unhide the recipient
from the Address Book by following these steps:

1. From the View menu, select Hidden Recipients.

2. Double click the Recipients container and highlight the mailbox desired.

3. Double click to view the properties of the mailbox.

4. Select the Advanced tab and uncheck the "Hide from Address Book" option.

5. The name can be resolved at this point. Once this is completed, you can hide
   the name from the Address Book again if needed.
