TITLE   :XFOR: Message from Client Not Homed on Server Crashes IMC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

E-mail sent through the Internet Mail Service by a user with no valid
credentials on the Exchange Server computer causes the Internet Mail Service to
crash.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the "Clients can only submit if homed on this server" option is selected on
the Connections page of the Internet Mail Service properties, authentication of
inbound connections is required. However, you can bypass this by using a
per-host setting that allows a host to bypass the authentication. This may be
set in the "Accept Connections" dialog on the Connections page.

Mail sent from the exempt host that fails the "homed on this server" check will
result in an Non-delivery report (NDR) to the administrator, which will cause a
crash because there is no authentication information.

The following event will be logged on the Exchange Server computer:

   Event 4037
   MSExchangeIMC
   Error
   An exception has occurred which was handled internally by the Internet
   Mail Service. This may have resulted in a message not being delivered.
   Code: 0xc0000005 Flags: 0x00000000 Address: 0x00462f42
