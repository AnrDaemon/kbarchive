SYMPTOMS
========

The Readme1st.txt file in the \Workshop folder indicates that the Smartest.exe
file can be run at any time to take and score the practice tests included with
this CD-ROM.

However, when you run the program, you may receive one of two errors:

   No practice questions appear in the program.

   -or-

   Application Error
   Exception EOleSysError in module SMARTEST.EXE AT 0002EE4A. Class not
   registered.

CAUSE
=====

There are no practice questions included with the Systems Management Server
kit.

The second error is caused by an incompatibility between this program and
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0.

STATUS

Microsoft Press has confirmed this to be a problem in "Microsoft Systems
Management Server Training." We will post further information here in the
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
