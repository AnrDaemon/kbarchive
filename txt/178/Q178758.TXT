TITLE   :XCON: CCMC Stops Randomly with Out of Disk Space Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Connector for Lotus cc:Mail logs the the following
event in the Windows NT Event Viewer:

   Event 98:
   Insufficient Disk Space

However, there is more than 4 GB of free space available on the server.
Restarting the Connector for cc:Mail does not resolve the problem. Deleting the
contents of the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Export directory sometimes allows the
Connector for cc:Mail to restart.

CAUSE
=====

Under some circumstances, the algorithm in the connector incorrectly calculates
disk free space on systems with less than 4 GB free.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
