PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97 kbmerge

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft Word 2000 version of this article, see Q192734.

For a Microsoft Word 98 version of this article, see Q192735.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you type information by using the data form of your mail-merge data source,
some field information may be lost.

NOTE: This problem has been reported to occur when there are nine or more data
fields in the data form.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you use the UP ARROW key or DOWN ARROW key to move
between fields in the data form.

NOTE: This problem does not occur in earlier versions of Word because the UP
ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys move the insertion point to the left or right,
respectively, within the field rather than moving it to a different field in the
data form.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the TAB or ENTER key to move from one field to the next, or use the mouse to
click between fields.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can display data records in the Data Form dialog box in one of the following
ways.

From the Mail Merge Helper Dialog Box
-------------------------------------

If you are working in the Mail Merge Helper dialog box, click Edit (next to Get
Data), and then click the data source you want.

From a Mail-Merge Main Document
-------------------------------

If you are working in a mail-merge main document, click Edit Data Source on the
Mail Merge toolbar.

From a Word Data Source Displayed in the Document Window
--------------------------------------------------------

If a Word data source is displayed in a document window, click Data Form on the
Database toolbar.
