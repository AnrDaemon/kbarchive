PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

OS/2 Warp clients version 3.0 or 4.0 can log on to a computer running Windows NT
Server 4.0 Service Pack 3 and File and Print services for NetWare (FPNW).
However, the client cannot map a network drive or access a file from the command
prompt.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the client tries to map or access a file from the command
prompt in OS/2. Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 provides support for extended NCP
to support Client32. As a result, the OS/2 support for NetWare from the command
prompt does not function properly.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0 Service
Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.
