TITLE   :Specifying a Group Name in LMHOSTS File May Cause STOP 0xA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Any Windows NT system that contains one or more NetBIOS group names specified in
the LMHOSTS file may experience a STOP 0xA error message with parameters similar
to the following:

   Stop 0xA (0000000a 00000000 00000002 00000000)

CAUSE
=====

If a group name is added to the NetBT name cache as a result of the network
activity of various services before the LMHOSTS file is fully parsed, and the
LMHOSTS file contains a matching group name entry, the system incorrectly
overwrites the cached entry with the LMHOSTS entry. Because it is assumed that
the LMHOSTS file only contains unique NetBIOS names and not group names, the
cached entry is incorrectly treated as unique, causing a STOP 0xA.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
