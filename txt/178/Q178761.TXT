TITLE   :XWEB: Attachments Produce JavaScript Errors in Browser
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word attachment in a
public folder or in an e-mail message from the Outlook Web Access client using
Internet Explorer (3.02 or 4.x), Internet Explorer starts Excel or Word within
the browser. Internet Explorer also inserts the following text in the first cell
or line of the document:

   <script
   language="JavaScript">top.location='/exchange/logon.asp'</script>


WORKAROUND
==========

For Internet Explorer 3.02 build 1300, the fix is to install Rfc1867.exe by
installing the Internet Explorer 3.02 File Upload Add-On from Microsoft's Web
site at http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download/.

Internet Explorer version 4.0 does not show this problem. For Internet Explorer
version 4.01, you must be running build 4.72.3110.8.or later, which is Internet
Explorer 4.01 SP1. This is publicly available from http://www.microsoft.com/ie.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
