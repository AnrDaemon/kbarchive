SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Flight Simulator 98 or Flight Simulator for Windows
95, you may receive the following error message:

   FLTSIM98 caused an invalid page fault in module FLTSIM98.exe

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for either of the following reasons:

   Flight Simulator 98 is installed.

 - A scenery or aircraft file is damaged or the wrong version.

RESOLUTION

To resolve this issue, remove both versions of Flight Simulator, delete the

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

   Windows 95.

6. Click Remove All, and then follow the Setup instructions.

7. Delete the Flight Simulator folder. The default location for the Flight

   this is not the folder into which you installed both version of Flight
   Simulator, delete the folder that contained the installations of Flight
   Simulator 98 and 95.

   For information about deleting folders in Microsoft Windows, click Start,
   click Help, and then click the Index tab. Type "deleting" (without the

8. Reinstall both versions of Flight Simulator by following these steps:

   a. Insert either Flight Simulator CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.

      If the Auto Insert Notification feature is enabled, Setup begins
      automatically. Follow the Setup program instructions.

   b. If Setup does not start automatically, click Start, point to Settings, and
      then click Control Panel.

   c. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

   d. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Install, and then click Finish. Follow
      the Setup program instructions.

   NOTE: When you are prompted to choose a location for the second version of
   Flight Simulator, choose a different folder than you selected in the first
   installation.
