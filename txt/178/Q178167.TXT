SYMPTOMS
========

The GeoFacts.vbp sample project fails with the following run-time error when run
on a Windows NT or Windows 2000 machine:

   Run-time error '-2147467259 (80004005)':
   Automation error

This error does not occur on a Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me machine.

CAUSE
=====

The run-time error occurs on the following line of code:

      Set shtWorld = GetObject("world.xls")

The GetObject function fails because the full path to world.xls is not specified
in the argument.

RESOLUTION
==========

When using the GetObject function, make sure that the full path to the file name
is specified. To correct the code in the GeoFacts.vbp sample, change the
following line of code (located in the Setup procedure in Module1):

      Set shtWorld = GetObject("world.xls")

to:

      Set shtWorld = GetObject(app.path & "\world.xls")

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.
