-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA server sponsor connections may utilize more bandwidth in LAN/WAN
environments than necessary for clients that do not use SNA Server Admin/Manager
components to remotely administer SNA Server.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server sends a large amount of information to Windows NT clients over the
sponsor connection which is only needed if Admin/Manager is running on the
client. This update makes it possible to disable the Admin/Manager support on
Windows NT clients by adding the following registry parameter after applying the
hotfix:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaBase\ 
   Parameters\NoManager: REG_DWORD:0|1

The default is 0. (1 disables Manager support)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11, 2.11
SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
