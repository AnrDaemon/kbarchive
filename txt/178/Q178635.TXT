TITLE   :Can Not Change Domain in Windows After You Use NETDOM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit Supplement II includes a command line utility
called NETDOM an administrator can use to join a domain from a command line.

If you join a domain with a version of NETDOM earlier than version 1.7, when you
change to a different domain by using the Network tool in Control Panel, you may
be unable to do so, and you may receive the following error message:

   Unable to update local security in order to join domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, upgrade to NETDOM version 1.7 or later.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT maintains a list of trusted domains. For a workstation, this list
contains only one element, the domain of which the workstation is a member.

Prior to version 1.7, NETDOM was not aware of the trusted domain under a domain
member. Thereby the GUI checks this information before changing domain.

For more information about NETDOM, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
