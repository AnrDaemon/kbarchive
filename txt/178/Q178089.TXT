-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the character parameter THORN_ICELANDIC_CAPITAL (EBCDIC 0xAE) is sent from
the host to the SNA Print Service, using a PDT, the character is always
converted to ASCII 0xDE. This happens regardless of what macro
THORN_ICELANDIC_CAPITAL is mapped to in the PDF File.

CAUSE
=====

The ASCII codes for THORN_ICELANDIC_CAPITAL and THORN_ICELANDIC_SMALL in the SNA
Server character table are incorrect.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
