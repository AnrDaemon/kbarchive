   STOP:0x00000098(0x647CDCB0,0x01BC9900,0x0002A300,0x00000000)
   END_OF_NT_EVALUATION_PERIOD

   The evaluation period for this installation of Windows NT has expired. This
   system will shutdown in one hour. To restore access to this installation of
   Windows NT, please upgrade this installation using a licensed distribution of
   this product.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must upgrade to a licensed version of Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0,
Enterprise Edition.

There is, however, a specific procedure to be followed to maintain an existing
Microsoft Cluster Server Installation.

If the loss of printer shares and folder shares is not an issue, follow the steps
that are outlined in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   node.
