MORE INFORMATION
================

If you cannot delete the printer after stopping the SNA Print Service, use one
of the following two methods to delete it:

 - Using SNA Server Manager, select File and then select Open Offline. Then
   select the path to the com.cfg file. It will be located in the
   <snaroot>\system\config directory. After SNA Server Manager has
   displayed the SNA Server configuration offline, delete the print service.

 - Using snacfg the command-line parameter is:

   snacfg [#configpath] printserver /delete

SYMPTOMS
========

If the machine name of the SNA Server computer has been changed and SNA Server
Manager lists two print servers with the same name, it may not be possible to
delete the second instance even when the SNA Print Service is stopped.

WORKAROUND
==========

An SNA Print Service cannot be deleted while the Print Server Service is active.
The service can be stopped using one of the following three methods:

 - On Control Panel, double-click Services, select SnaPrint, and then select
   Stop.

 - From SNA Manager, expand the Print Servers Folder in the left pane, select
   the print server that you want to stop, and then right-click and select Stop,
   (or select from the menu, Service, Stop).

 - From a command prompt, type "net stop snaprint" (without the quotation
   marks).
