The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to a computer running Windows NT Server and the
Remote Access Service (RAS) from either a RAS client or a Dial-Up Networking
(DUN) client, you may receive the following error:

   No domain server was available to validate your password. You may not be able
   to gain access to some network resources.

The RAS server is using a RAS device that uses its own Point to Point Protocol
(PPP) validation.


CAUSE
=====

Certain RAS devices may use their own PPP validation and not the validation of
the RAS server. This may not be a problem if such a device is directly connected
to a primary domain controller (PDC) or a backup domain controller (BDC).
However, if the RAS server is a member server that participates in domain
security, the RAS client may not be able to get validated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform one of the following:

 - Exchange your RAS device for one that is on the Microsoft Windows NT Server
   Hardware Compatibility List. For more information, see the following article
   in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q131303 Latest Windows 2000 and Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List (HCL)

-or-

 - On the RAS client, specify the domain name in the user credentials, such as
   the following:

   <DomainName>\<UserName>

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem has to do with the way the authentication takes place. The RAS
server attempts to log the client into its local account database first (if one
exists). Next, the RAS server appends the domain name and sends the validation
request to the appropriate domain controller. If the RAS device attempts the
validation, it never appends the domain name. As a result, if there is not an
account in the local account database, the client will not be validated.
