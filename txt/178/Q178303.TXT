PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Chat Server version 5.5 from the Microsoft Exchange
Server 5.5 CD, setup may report the message "Unable to start Microsoft Chat
Service," although the service is started. This message occurs near the end of
the "copying files" stage of setup.

CAUSE
=====

When you install Microsoft Chat Server version 5.5 over an existing Chat 1.0
installation and the Chat 1.0 services are running, setup will incorrectly
report that it is unable to start the services and tell you to check the event
log for further details.

WORKAROUND
==========

The services should be started and the message can be ignored.
