TITLE   :LUA Program Hangs After Receiving Exception Request (EXR)
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An SNA Server LUA application may hang indefinately after receiving an exception
request (EXR) message on a session, which SNA Server sends to the client after
it has detected a bad RU in an outbound message from the host.

CAUSE
=====

If the host sends a bad RU on a session, the SNA Server changes the message to
Exception Request type (EXR) before sending it to the LUA application. However,
SNA Server was failing to set the End Chain (EC) indicator on the EXR message,
causing the LUA application to hang indefinately waiting for EC to be received.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 (including SP1
and SP2).

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
