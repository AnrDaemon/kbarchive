TITLE   :Service Pack Update Prompts for Windows NT Workstation CD
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When run from a compact disc, Update.exe from Service Pack 4 and 5 will prompt
for the Windows NT Workstation compact disc. It will not install the service
pack.

CAUSE
=====

The Update.inf file that determines what media is recognized during the
installation is defined in the following section:

      [Source Media Descriptions]
      1 = "Windows NT Workstation CD-ROM" , TAGFILE = cdrom.w

The installation program is looking for the I386 directory or Cdrom.w directly
off the root of the compact disc. If the I386 directory is renamed or it is
created as a subdirectory on the drive, it will not recognize the compact disc
as valid media and prompt for the Windows NT Workstation compact disc.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Copy the I386 folder to the local hard disk or a network drive by using the
   following steps:

   To copy to the local hard drive, at a command prompt change to the CD-ROM
   drive by typing the drive letter and pressing ENTER. Type the following
   command, and then press ENTER:

   E:>xcopy I386 c:\

   To copy to a network drive, substitute the mapped drive letter for drive C in
   the command listed above.

 - Copy the I386 directory to the local hard disk or network drive and run
   Update.exe from this location.

 - Burn the CD-ROM so that the I386 directory is on the root of the drive or
   place a file called Cdrom.w to the root of the drive.
