TITLE   :SQL Server Hangs When Sending a Message Using SQLMail
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,6.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
 - Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer running Windows NT Server 4.0 with Service Pack 3 (SP3) and
Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 installed, when you send a message using xp_sendmail,
SQLMail and the SQL Server service may stop responding (hang). You cannot stop
the SQL Server service using SQL Enterprise Manager, SQL Service Manager, or the
NET STOP MSSQLSERVER command.

CAUSE
=====

This problem, originating in the Windows NT SP3 build of Mapi32.dll, is known to
occur when your Windows Messaging mail profile is configured to connect to the
Internet (for example, a POP3 mail server) and the SQL Server "priority boost"
configuration parameter is set to 1. This may not occur with the first message
sent, but may occur on subsequent attempts to send a message.


RESOLUTION
==========

To workaround this problem, set the SQL Server "priority boost" configuration
parameter to 0.

If, for other reasons, you require this configuration parameter to be set to 1,
obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT version 4.0.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


NOTE: Returning to the previous build of Mapi32.dll (which is the base build of
this file, installed with Windows NT 4.0) is not recommended, because fixes were
made to this file for Windows NT SP3 to correct other SQLMail problems. Please
see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article for more information:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
