TITLE   :PRB: Application Loses Focus or Opens Minimized on Startup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you launch a Visual FoxPro application, it appears to open minimized or
loses focus.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you include the following code in the Init event of a
Top-Level form:

   Application.Visible = .F.

RESOLUTION
==========

Move the following line:

   Application.Visible = .F.

to the Activate event of the Top-Level form.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Application.Visible = .F." line hides the main Visual FoxPro window. The
reason the application loses focus and appears to open minimized is related to
the sequence of events. Because the form's Init event sets the application's
Visible property to false, the application is hidden and focus returns to the
last active object or application. Even though the application no longer has
focus, the code continues executing as a background process.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program called Runhide.prg, and paste the following code:

   oLost = CREATEOBJECT('NOFOCUS')
   oLost.Show()
   READ EVENTS
   RETURN

   DEFINE CLASS noFocus AS FORM
       AutoCenter = .T.
       Height  = 450
       Width   = 640
       Caption = "Lost Focus Form"
       Visible = .T.
       ShowWindow = 2
       WindowType = 0

       ADD OBJECT frmcaption AS frmcap WITH Top=225, Left=220

       PROCEDURE Init
           Application.Visible = .F.
       ENDPROC

       PROCEDURE Click()
           ThisForm.Release
           CLEAR EVENTS
           Application.Visible = .T.
       ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS frmcap AS LABEL
       FontName = "Arial"
       FontSize = 10
       FontBold = .T.
       Caption = "Click anywhere on the form to close"
       Visible = .T.
       AutoSize = .T.
   ENDDEFINE

2. At a command prompt, type the following command:

   "DO RUNHIDE" (without the quotation marks)

3. To hide the main Visual FoxPro window while the application retains focus,
   create a program called Nohide.prg, and paste the following code:

   oNotLost = CREATEOBJECT('NOFOCUS')
   oNotLost.Show()
   READ EVENTS
   RETURN

   DEFINE CLASS hasFocus AS FORM
       AutoCenter = .T.
       Height  = 450
       Width   = 640
       Caption = "Has Focus Form"
       Visible = .T.
       ShowWindow = 2
       WindowType = 0

       ADD OBJECT frmcaption AS frmcap WITH Top=225, Left=220

       PROCEDURE Activate
           Application.Visible = .F.
       ENDPROC

       PROCEDURE Click()
           ThisForm.Release
           CLEAR EVENTS
           Application.Visible = .T.
       ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS frmcap AS LABEL
       FontName = "Arial"
       FontSize = 10
       FontBold = .T.
       Caption = "Click anywhere on the form to close"
       Visible = .T.
       AutoSize = .T.
   ENDDEFINE

4. At a command prompt, type the following command:

   "DO NOHIDE" (without the quotation marks)
