======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, version 5.5, can export mailbox or
public folder resource reports to a .CSV file. The version 5.5 Administrator
program has this capability even when run against Exchange 4.0 or 5.0 Servers.

Mailbox and public folder resource usage, including total number of messages and
message size per mailbox or folder, are displayed in the Administrator program
at:

   Configuration, Servers, <Servername>, Private Information Store,
   Mailbox Resources

and

   Configuration, Servers, <Servername>, Public Information Store, Public
   Folder Resources

Prior to version 5.5, Exchange Server relied on Crystal Reports to provide such
reporting. This article explains both how to use either Crystal Reports or the
version 5.5 Exchange Administrator program to generate resource reports.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To generate a report in Exchange Server 5.5 through the Administrator program,
do the following:

NOTE: If you start Exchange Server in Raw mode, these steps do not work.

1. In the Administrator program, go to Servers, Servername, and open the Mailbox
   Resources window for the server.

2. Highlight an entry on the right side of the screen.

3. Select "Save Window Contents" from the File menu. After this information is
   saved to a file, that file can be manipulated with a database or spreadsheet
   program to generate custom reports.

Crystal Reports must be installed from the Microsoft BackOffice 97 Resource Kit.
It is located in the Exchange\winnt\I386\Admin\Crystal directory. To install it,
double-click on the CRWINTEL installation icon.

To generate a report on the mailbox resources in use by a particular server from
Crystal Reports, do the following:

1. Run CRW32 from the directory where you installed the application.

2. Select File/New/Standard Expert from the menu bar.

3. Click Exchange Data at the Step 1 prompt "Choose data to report on."

4. The Log On Server box will appear. Select Mailbox Admin and click OK.

5. The Logon to Exchange Servers box will appear. Click Select Servers, and
   select the server to be reported on.

6. Click Select Profiles, and select a profile to be used. This profile must
   have the permissions to access this information.

7. Click Done.

8. In the Choose SQL Table window, the Mailbox Admin Table should be
   highlighted. Click Add.

9. Click Done.

10. Click Next.

11. From Property Fields, double-click Mailbox and Total Message Size (Byte).

12. Click Next.

13. In Report Fields:, the Admin Table: Mailbox should be selected. Click Add.

14. Click Next three more times. On the Style tab, enter the Title of the
   report.

15. Click Preview Report.

16. Select File/Print Preview from the menu. The following message will be
   displayed:

   This program is a limited version of Crystal Reports. To generate
   reports on multiple servers, please contact Crystal Reports for the
   latest "Full" version and instructions on how to generate the
   reports.
