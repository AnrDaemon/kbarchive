SUMMARY
=======

The MS Chart control can create an XY Scatter chart that you can use to plot X/Y
coordinate data. This article shows you how to create a sample program that
displays X/Y coordinate data on a Scatter chart using the MS Chart control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can create an XY Scatter chart by treating your data points as a two-
dimensional grid. This grid comprised one or more data series. Each data series
in the grid takes two columns and as many rows as you have data points. For
example, the first and second columns make up the X and Y coordinates of the
first data series. The third and fourth columns make up the X and Y coordinates
of the second data series, and so on. The following shows a sample grid. In this
grid, the first data series is made up of the following 10 data points:

   1,2  2,4  3,6  4,8  5,10  6,12  7,14  8,16  9,18  10,20

The second data series is made up of the following 10 data points:

   3,4  6,8  9,12  12,16  15,20  18,24  21,28  24,32  27,36  30,40

 First    Second
 Series   Series
 X   Y    X   Y
-----------------
 01  02   03  04
 02  04   06  08
 03  06   09  12
 04  08   12  16
 05  10   15  20
 06  12   18  24
 07  14   21  28
 08  16   24  32
 09  18   27  36
 10  20   30  40

To fill the chart's data grid, you can use the Row and Column properties to
specify a cell in the grid and then use the Data property to plot that
coordinate:

   MSChart1.Column = 1
   MSChart1.Row = 1
   MSChart1.Data = 1000

The next section shows how to create a sample project that demonstrates plotting
X/Y coordinate data on a scatter chart.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

This project assumes you added the MS Chart Component to the project. The project
will plot the previously described data.

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a Chart control and a CommandButton to Form1.

3. In the MS Chart property window, click the Custom property ellipses button to
   display the property pages. On the Chart Tab, check XY (Scatter) for the
   Chart type.

4. Copy the following code to the Code window of Form1:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Dim x As Integer, y As Integer

            MSChart1.RowCount = 10
            MSChart1.ColumnCount = 4

            For y = 1 To 4
                MSChart1.Column = y
                For x = 1 To 10
                    MSChart1.Row = x
                    MSChart1.Data = x * y
                Next x
            Next y
         End Sub

5. Press the F5 key to run the program. Click the CommandButton and the data is
   plotted.
