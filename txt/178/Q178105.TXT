TITLE   :Using "Winnt.exe /e" Command May Interfere with ZAK Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Zero Administration Kit for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT Setup (Winnt.exe) program with the /e switch to set
up a Zero Administration Kit (ZAK) Appstation or Taskstation, file restrictions
may not be properly applied to the computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the process called by the /e switch causes the
Zakboot1.cmd file to be run before the first reboot during ZAK Setup. As a
result, the Cacls.exe program may not run and may not apply the file
restrictions to the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use a batch file to run your program during ZAK
Setup. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Create a batch file to run your external program.

2. Configure the Zakboot1.cmd file to run your batch file before processing the
   SHUTDOWN command. For example, place the following command on the line above
   the SHUTDOWN command in the Zakboot1.cmd file:

         cmd /c %SystemRoot%\\<your_batchfile.cmd>
