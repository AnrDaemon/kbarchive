SUMMARY
=======

If you open a Component Library in Component Builder (CB) and make a change to
it, you are unable to save it. The Save menu item is disabled. Check the CB
title bar to see if the component is either Registered or Read Only.

This article describes a situation in which the reason that a typelib cannot be
saved, is less obvious. A Visual Basic (VB) project is open that references a
particular typelib. Subsequently, the programmer decides to make a change to the
typelib and, in preparation, deletes it from its Microsoft Transaction Server
(MTS) package. Therefore, it is no longer registered. Let's also say it is not
marked read-only. The programmer then starts Component Builder (CB), opens the
typelib and changes it. When CB is instructed to save the typelib, a message box
appears with the following text:

   Cannot overwrite ~\<filename>.TLB. Check that the file is not being
   used by another application...

You cannot save it because the VB project has a reference to it. There are two
solutions. The first solution is to close the VB project. The second is to
temporarily remove the component as a reference in the VB project. In either
case, you can then save the typelib.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To save a Component Library when the title bar says "Registered," first use MTS
Explorer snap-in to shut down the server processes, and then delete the
Component Library from its package.

To save a Component Library when the title bar says "Read Only," first use
Windows Explorer to remove this property from the typelib.
