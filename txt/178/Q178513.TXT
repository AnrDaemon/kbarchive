======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows, you may be alerted that the
10_Past_3.748 virus was found in the Unwise.exe file. This alert is incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

The Norton AntiVirus utility monitors your system for certain activities that
may indicate the presence of a virus. The Unwise.exe program performs one or
more of the activities for which Norton AntiVirus is monitoring.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, temporarily disable Norton AntiVirus and then install
Bookshelf 98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Unwise.exe file does not contain a virus. Although Norton AntiVirus
indicates that the file is performing "virus-like" activities, previous versions
of Norton AntiVirus do not indicate this behavior, nor do other virus detection
utilities.
