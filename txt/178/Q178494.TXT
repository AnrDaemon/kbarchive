TITLE   :PRB: More Than Nine Functions in Left Join Causes Memory Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If there are more than nine functions in your left join SQL statement the
following error occurs:

   There is not enough memory to complete this operation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create separate User Defined Functions (UDFs) to eliminate the large number of
functions in left join.

Create a program called Ztest.prg that contains the functions called by the UDF
shown below:

      FUNCTION testfun1
      RETURN STR(a.Row1,4)+STR(a.Row2,4)+STR(a.Row3,4)+STR(a.Row4,4) ;
      +STR(a.Row5,4)

      FUNCTION testfun2
      RETURN STR(b.Row1,4)+STR(b.Row2,4)+STR(b.Row3,4)+STR(b.Row4,4) ;
      +STR(b.Row5,4)

Use the following code to execute the new SQL SELECT statement that calls the UDF
code:

      SET PROCEDURE TO Ztest.prg
      SELECT * FROM test1 a LEFT JOIN test2 b ON testfun1() = testfun2()

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Use the following commands to create two tables. Each table contains one
   record with five numeric fields:

         CREATE TABLE test1 (row1 n(4),row2 n(4),row3 n(4),row4 n(4), ;
         row5 n(4))
         CREATE TABLE test2 (row1 n(4),row2 n(4),row3 n(4),row4 n(4), ;
         row5 n(4))
         INSERT INTO test1 VALUE (1,2,3,4,5)
         INSERT INTO test2 VALUE (1,2,3,4,5)

2. Issue the command below in the Command window:

         SELECT * FROM Test1 a LEFT JOIN Test2 b ON ;
         STR(a.Row1,4)+STR(a.Row2,4)+STR(a.Row3,4)+STR(a.Row4,4)
         +STR(a.Row5,4) ;
         = STR(b.Row1,4)+STR(b.Row2,4)+STR(b.Row3,4)
         +STR(b.Row4,4)+STR(b.Row5,4)
