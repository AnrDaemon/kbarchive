The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02 for Windows NT 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the French version of Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x is installed over
Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, Web access to the Exchange Server computer will
fail with VB Script errors.

CAUSE
=====

The version of VBScript.dll installed by Internet Explorer (1.0.0.806)
overwrites the version installed by Exchange Server (3.1.0.2115).

WORKAROUND
==========

Copy the newer version of VBScript.dll from the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM to
the <WinNT>\System32 directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Internet Explorer 3.x copies files during setup there is no warning when
the newer version of VBScript.dll is replaced with an older version. Normally,
there is a warning before replacing existing files that are of a newer version.
