TITLE   :Unable to Send Private Message to Exchange Recipient
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to send a private message to a Microsoft Exchange Server recipient
who has a designated alternate recipient, you may receive the following
non-delivery report (NDR):

   From: System Administrator
   Subject: Undeliverable: test message

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

      Subject: test message
      Sent: 12/1/97 12:00 PM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

      John Doe on 12/1/97 12:00 PM

      Unable to deliver the message because the originator prohibited
      redirection to an alternate recipient or the message was encrypted

      MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:<SiteName>:<ServerName>

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. Private messages sent to a specific recipient are not
intended to be received by an alternate recipient.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent this behavior, disable the use of alternate recipients on the
mailbox. Alternate recipients are designated in the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program by selecting the Delivery Options tab of the recipient's
mailbox.

In Microsoft Outlook, you can assign delegate permissions for your mailbox to
other users. This enables private messages to be delivered to your mailbox, but
delegates cannot view these private messages.
