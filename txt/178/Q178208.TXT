TITLE   :CrashOnAuditFail with Logon/Logoff Auditing Causes Blue Screen
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2000,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you shut down your computer, the computer may stop responding (hang), and
you may receive the following error message on a blue screen:

   STOP 0xC0000244
   An attempt to generate a security audit failed

This behavior may occur even if the audit log is not full.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT attempts to report a logoff audit in the event log after the event
log has shut down. As this audit attempt fails and CrashOnAuditFail is enabled,
the system displays a blue screen error message that reports an audit failure.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this problem by disabling logon/logoff auditing.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


MORE INFORMATION
================

In some instances, the server may not bugcheck, but may instead run very slowly
after administrator logon. The system may also report continuous RPC errors
after logon. Non-administrators will not be able to log on as a result of the
CrashOnAuditFail key being set to 0x1.
