TITLE   :XADM: Store Logs Error 1203 When You Delete a Mailbox
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you delete a mailbox that was created but never used, the Microsoft
Exchange Server Information Store (IS) service logs the following error to the
event log:

   Event ID: 1203
   Source:    ExchangeIS Private
   Type: Error
   Category: General

   Failed to delete the mailbox of
    /o=Microsoft/ou=DOMAIN/cn=Recipients/cn=MyMailBox  with    error
    0x8004010f.

NOTE: Error 0x8004010f is Mapi Error MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND

CAUSE
=====

Because a user never logged on to the mailbox and never received mail, the
database entries for the user were never created. When Exchange Server attempts
to delete the mailbox, the system attempts to locate the database entries, but
no records are found and the MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND error is reported. This error was
not logged previously.

WORKAROUND
==========

When the symptoms occur as described above, the error can safely be ignored.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
