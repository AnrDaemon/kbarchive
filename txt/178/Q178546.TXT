TITLE   :CSNW Does Not Display Directory Name with Extended Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) client using Windows NT Explorer
double-clicks a directory containing Russian characters on a File and Print
Services for NetWare (FPNW) server, an error message is displayed:

   The folder xxx is not available, folder has been moved or has been
   deleted.

All files and directories below this directory are not accessible.

CAUSE
=====

After you receive a directory listing from a FPNW server and in the process of
accessing one of these directories by double-clicking it, CSNW converts a
Unicode string to an OEM string for NetWare compatibility reasons. During this
conversion, the directory name with Russian characters was incorrectly changed
into uppercase. Therefore, the client tried to access a directory containing
only uppercase characters on the FPNW server. Because this directory does not
exist on the FPNW server, the above error was displayed.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
