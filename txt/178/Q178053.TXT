TITLE   :XADM: Store Thread's Processor Use Peaks Indefinitely
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A thread in the store indefinitely consumes a substantial percentage of
processor utilization. In addition, this problem begins to occur at
approximately the same time every week. If the spinning thread is viewed in a
debugger, the call stack will appear similar to the following:

   035efd50 0045b208 : store!TibNext+0x34
   035efd50 00459fb8 : store!REPL__EcGetNextFtSend+0xd8
   035efd90 0045a0f0 : store!REPL__EcGetNextFtSendStatus+0xc8
   035efdd0 0044f448 : store!REPL__EcSetFtSendStatus+0xc0
   035efe10 00472670 : store!EcReplFolderMessagesSend+0x238
   035efec0 0047283c : store!EcReplSendMessages+0xc0
   035eff10 004713e0 : store!EcReplSendMessagesSelectedTimes+0x7c
   035eff50 005258ac : store!FReplAgent+0x130
   035eff80 77e6cbe8 : store!EcProcessTask+0x1bc

CAUSE
=====

This problem only occurs when a public folder has been selected to replicate to
other servers only once a week. The store's thread remains in a loop
indefinitely while attempting to calculate the next instance to send a status
message.
