TITLE   :XADM: Directory Takes a Long Time to Start with EventID 1107
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

 

MORE INFORMATION
================

This case can be tracked in the application event log by monitoring for the
following event IDs:

   EventId=1107
   This directory has been restored from backup. The directory replication
   agent (DRA) is attempting to synchronize with all other directories.
   Until this is complete, this directory will not accept updates.

   EventId=1108
   The directory replication agent (DRA) has finished synchronizing with
   all other directories. This directory can now accept updates.

After this synchronization is complete, the directory will be started and
accessible from the Exchange Administrator program. If the Exchange directory
was manually started, it will display the ticking clock for the service startup
until both of the above event IDs appear. Additionally, Performance Monitor will
show nominal disk activity.

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Exchange Server directory is restored from backup, it may take
a long time to start.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design. The directory must synchronize with the directories
on all other Exchange Server computers within the same Exchange site. The amount
of time required to synchronize this directory depends on network accessibility
to the other Exchange Server computers and whether the Exchange directory
service is running on the other Exchange Server computers.
