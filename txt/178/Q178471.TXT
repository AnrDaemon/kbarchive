TITLE   :STOP 0XA Caused by Race Condition in VDM and Process Delete
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When running 16-bit programs that require the Virtual DOS Machine (VDM). the
following STOP error may occur:

   Stop 0x0000000A (0x00000084, 0x00000002, 0x00000001, 0x80003D4A)
   Hal.dll.

This problem is most likely to occur on systems with more than one processor.

CAUSE
=====

A race condition exists between process delete and delayed virtual interrupt
processing. This causes a NULL parameter to be passed to the Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL) acquire spin lock routine.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Ntoskrnl.exe.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
