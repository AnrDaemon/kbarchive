SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a new profile for Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Exchange, you
may not be prompted for a profile name.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if no MAPI profile exists on the computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To create the first profile with a specific name, follow these steps:

1. Start either the Microsoft Exchange Setup Wizard or the Microsoft Outlook
   Setup Wizard.

2. Select the "Manually configure information services" option, or if you are
   using the Macintosh client, select "Manually configure profile."

3. Click the Next button.

4. You will be prompted for a profile name. Once you have entered a name,
   continue through the Wizard to completely configure the profile.

As an alternative to the above method, you can also do the following:

1. Create a new profile with the desired characteristics.

2. Copy the profile, and enter a name for the new profile.

3. You can then delete the original profile.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create the first MAPI profile for a Windows client, the profile name
will be determined by the following Registry key:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER
      \Software
         \Microsoft
            \MS Setup (ACME)
               \User Info
                  \DefName

If this key does not exist or you are using a Macintosh client, the profile name
will default to "MS Exchange Settings."
