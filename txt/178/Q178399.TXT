-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a message composed in Wordmail that contains text altered by
subscripting or by character positioning of a group of characters where the
point positioning is greater than the point size of the text, the text becomes
invisible in an Exchange client and/or Wordpad.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the differences in the RTF specifications between
Word97 and Outlook and WordPad and Exchange.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not format the text in this way, or use the
Outlook client as the primary messaging client.


Additional query words: formatted text Outlook RTF
