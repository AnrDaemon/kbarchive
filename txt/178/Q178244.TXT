SYMPTOMS
========

The Information Store stops responding. The event log shows event ID 3039:

   The error %1 was encountered while trying to communicate with the
   message store. An attempt to refresh the connection will be made.
   If not successful, the service will be shut down.

CAUSE

non-delivery report (NDR) for a UTF-7 message from his or her mailbox.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - In the event log, find the user logged on just before the crash. Log this
   user account on with a MAPI client and delete or move the NDR from the inbox.
