-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on to Windows 95, you may receive the following error
message:

   That password is incorrect.

If you click Cancel, you receive the following error message:

   The network could not validate your user name. You cannot use Windows unless
   your user name is validated by the network. Make sure you typed everything
   correctly, or contact your administrator.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages can occur if all of the following conditions exist:

 - Microsoft Family Logon is set as your primary network logon.

 - User profiles are enabled in Windows 95.

 - Your computer requires validation from a network server before you can log on
   to Windows 95.

 - Your computer uses a system policy in which password caching is disabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, change your primary network logon to Client For
Microsoft Networks. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
   the F8 key, and then choose Safe Mode from the Startup menu.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click Network.

4. In the Primary Network Logon box, click Client For Microsoft Networks, and
   then click OK.

5. Click Yes when you are prompted to restart your computer.


MORE INFORMATION

The Microsoft Family Logon network client is included with Internet Explorer 4.0
