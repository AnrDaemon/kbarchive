PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you upgrade from Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 to Exchange Server
5.5, the EventConfig_<servername> item in the Events Root system folder
does not appear in the Exchange Administrator program.

This occurs because the Exchange Event Service has not been installed. When you
upgrade an existing computer, setup generally does not add new services unless
you select them. The Event Service is not installed by default.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the Exchange Event Service, run the Exchange Server 5.5 setup
program. Choose Add\Remove, and select the Microsoft Exchange Event Service
option under Microsoft Exchange Server.

Additional query words: MSExchangeES
