SYMPTOMS
========

The Site Configuration Manager is unable to start the Package Command Manager
(PCM) service on remote servers separated from the Systems Management Server
site server by slow wide area network (WAN) links. A Systems Management Server
event 225 is logged. Attempting to start the service manually yields the
following error:

==========

To work around this problem, do any one of the following:

 - Configure the remote servers so that they are a part of a local Systems
   Management Server site.

 - Obtain the hotfix mentioned in the STATUS section of this article. This fix
   should have the following timestamp:

 - Wait for and apply Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4.

versions 1.1 and 1.2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
