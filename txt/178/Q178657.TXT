TITLE   :XADM: Hyperlinks Composed in WordMail 97 Do Not Function
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Hyperlinks included in documents composed using WordMail 97 are not functional
if the message is accessed through Outlook Web Access client or a POP3 client.
Additionally, if the message is sent over the Internet, the hyperlink will
become non-functional.

Hyperlinks (for example, http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/misc/hlink/hlink.asp
can normally be included in e-mail messages when you use an Exchange or Outlook
client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the sending client uses WordMail 97 and includes a hyperlink but the
recipient is not using WordMail 97, the hyperlink often will not work. This is
particularly true if the hyperlink has any spaces in the filename.

This particular problem is not an Exchange Server issue, rather it is a
limitation of the differences between the way the non-WordMail clients use
hyperlinks versus the way that WordMail inserts hyperlinks.
