SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to sort by summary information in a custom view of an Adobe PDF
freedoc, you will not see the desired results in the client display.

PDF files (Adobe Portable Document Format) are the format in which documents are
saved for viewing and transfer via Acrobat Reader.

Microsoft Office gives you the ability to sort by summary information of a user's
document. This is done when the document is posted as a freedoc in a public
folder using a custom view from the client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The summary information from the Microsoft Office products can be found under
File, Properties of that program.
