TITLE   :Connecting to a Server is Slow over RAS Using LMHOSTS File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you dial into a remote site, the initial attempt to connect to a server
share point can take up to 90 seconds to complete.

CAUSE
=====

If the name of the server being connected to is resolved by using the local
LMHOSTS file, when attempting to connect, Windows NT must wait for the
connection attempt over the local LAN to timeout before the connection over RAS
is accepted. If you use the normal default TCP/IP values for
TcpMaxConnectRetransmissions, it will take 90 seconds to time out.

This problem is not experienced if WINS or broadcast name resolution is used to
locate the computer being connected to.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this problem by lowering the value of
TcpMaxConnectRetransmissions. Setting this to a value of 1 reduces the delay to
18 seconds. However, lowering this value may cause problems when establishing a
connection to a server over a slow link.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
