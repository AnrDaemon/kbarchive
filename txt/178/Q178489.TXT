The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message displays when you attempt to call a function in a
dynamic-link library (DLL) file from Visual Basic:

   Error 53 "File Not Found"

The error message occurs at the function call statement.

CAUSE
=====

This message occurs when Windows is unable to load the specified DLL,
particularly if the DLL has not been saved at the specified location. It will
also occur if the dependency files required by the DLL file are not installed in
the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the dependency files required by the DLL file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are a several available tools that will help you determine the dependency
files for a DLL file:

1. The Dependency Walker on the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) will
   display dependencies in a graphical form. In fact, if you use Depends on a
   machine where this problem occurs, the missing DLL is displayed with a red
   circle, making it easy to determine what the trouble lies.

   You can obtain the Dependency Walker (Depends.exe) from the Platform SDK
   CD-ROM that comes with the MSDN. It can also be downloaded from the following
   Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/setuplauncher.asp

2. The QuickView utility that ships with Windows NT 4.0 shows the dependency
   files required by a selected DLL file. The QuickView utility can be installed
   from the Windows NT Setup tab of the Add/Remove Programs Properties dialog
   box in the Control Panel.

   NOTE: The Windows 95 version of QuickView does not provide this functionality.

3. DUMPBIN.EXE is a utility that ships with Microsoft Visual C++ that can also
   tell what are the required dependency files required by a DLL file. Use this
   command line utility with the /import parameter to determine the dependency
   files.
