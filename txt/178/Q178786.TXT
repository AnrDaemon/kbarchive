======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To support fax transmissions that include extended characters (the IBM Extended
Character Set) using the Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax version 3.0 configured
with a supported GammaLINK GammaFAX card using the GCAS CAS driver, version
1.0.2, the string

   GFEXTEND 1 2

will need to be added to the GammaFAX configuration file called, Gfax.$dc.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This string forces the GammaFAX software to properly acknowledge extended
characters, (the IBM Extended Character Set) that can be included as part of a
fax transmission and needs to be appended to the Gfax.$dc file.

Gfax.$dc is generated during the installation of GammaLINK GammaFAX fax card
software. It will be located in the local GammaFAX installation directory of the
hosting workstation and will need to be modified to appear like the example
below:

      GFAX.$DC
      --------

      CHASSIS 1
      BUFFERS 2
      NUMCHAN 1
      CHANNEL 1 0 GFAX1.1
      COUNTRY 1 1
      INIT 1
      LOAD 1  c:\gammafax\gfxcp.bin
      CSID 1 [user's phone #]
      GFXSHUTDOWN 1 0
      POLLT 0 275
      CONTROLT 60
      QUEUET 45
      UPDATET 300
      GFEXTEND 1 2

Completing this change will allow vertical border lines to appear correctly in
the distribution template box that normally appears at the bottom of the cover
page of a received FAX. Otherwise, border lines appear as control codes, such as
^M.

For additional information regarding the usage of GFEXTEND and the command
switches that modify its operation, please refer to the GammaLINK GammaFAX CPi
Reference Manual that comes with the fax card.

Additional query words: 3.00 FAX
