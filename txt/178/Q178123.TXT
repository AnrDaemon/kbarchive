======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Cinemania for Windows, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 editions 
 - Microsoft Encarta 98 Encyclopedia for Windows 
 - Microsoft Music Central for Windows, 1996, 1997 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to play a video clip in one of the Microsoft programs listed at
the beginning of this article, you may experience any of the following
symptoms:

 - Video playback may be distorted or scrambled.

 - Video playback may jump or skip.

 - Video playback controls may not be displayed.

 - When you open a new video clip, you may see the final frame of the last video
   clip that you played.

 - When you use Cinemania or Music Central, when you click a video clip title in
   the Gallery, it may not play automatically.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for either of the following reasons:

 - The Microsoft DirectVideo driver is installed, and your video card does not
   support it. DirectVideo accelerates playback of video clips that use Indeo or
   Cinepak video compression.

 - The installation program for your video display card or video capture card
   added legacy support for DCI functions that can conflict with the DCI support
   in Microsoft Windows 95/98.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Multimedia.

3. On the Advanced tab or the Devices tab, double-click Video Compression
   Codecs.

4. If DirectVideo Driver (DRAW) appears in the list, double-click it, and then
   click Remove.

5. When you are prompted to remove the DirectVideo driver, click Yes, and then
   click OK until you return to Control Panel.

6. Close Control Panel.

   where <device> is one of the following values:

    - RFMDCI
    - MIRODCI
    - DISPLAY

12. On the Search menu, click Find.

13. Type "[display]" (without the quotation marks), and then click Find Next.
