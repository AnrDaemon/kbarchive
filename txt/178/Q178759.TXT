TITLE   :XCLN: Outlook Spell Check Suggests More Words Than Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Outlook client appears to use the same spell checking engine and dictionary
as the Exchange client, but Outlook returns more suggestions on some words when
a spell check is performed.

CAUSE
=====

The calling executable (Exchng32.exe or Outlook.exe) employs an enhanced
function call to the spelling library. (SCCSUGGEST, which both do and
SCCSUGGESTMORE, which Outlook does).

When a spell check is run, the application makes a SCCSUGGEST call to the
spelling DLL, this is the initial suggestion of correct words (top replacement
possibilities). After a specified amount of idle time, the application makes a
SCCSUGGESTMORE call; this brings up the second set of suggestions. On a fast
computer, it all seems to happen at the same time, on a slow computer, you see a
pause before then the additional words are suggested. Outlook and Word use the
SCCSUGGESTMORE call, Exchange does not.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use Word as the E-mail editor (if you have Office
97 installed, this should be an option) or upgrade to Outlook.

STATUS
======

 

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing Office 97 or copying the same Mssp2_en.lex and Mssp232.dll from
Outlook does not change this behavior. The Exchange Client still returns the
same limited set of suggestions.
