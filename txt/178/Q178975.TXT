TITLE   :XADM: Remove All Does Not Remove Setup Key in Registry
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Exchange Server setup and click Remove All, the following
key may still exist in the registry:

   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup

In Exchange 2000, if a previous installation was not successful, and when the
Administrator re-attempted Exchange 2000 Setup, and opted to "remove all,"
remnants of the original installation still remain under the Exchange Setup key.
The Exchange Server Setup Progress.log may display:

   [13:10:53]
   Prerequisites for Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging Service failed: The
   component "Microsoft Exchange Messaging and collaboration Services" cannot be
   assigned the action "Install" because:
   - A server object for this server ("ServerName") already exists in the
   Administrative Group "AdminGroupName". You must either remove this server
   object before installing, or run setup with the "DisasterRecovery" switch if
   you are attempting to recover this server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base when it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to successfully reinstall Exchange 2000, it is necessary to manually
delete all subkeys below (but not including) the Setup key.
