   Drive letter X:\ is not accessible. The parameter is incorrect. Retry or
   Cancel.

   Drive letter X:\ is not accessible. The file or directory is corrupt and
   non-readable. Retry or Cancel.

NOTE: X is the drive letter of the CD ROM drive.

its usage.

researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
