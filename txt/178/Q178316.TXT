TITLE   :SNA 4.0 Backup Server Logs Numerous 670 Events With 3.0 Primary
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade an SNA Server backup configuration server to version 4.0 (or
4.0 SP1) in a subdomain containing an SNA Server 3.0 primary configuration
server, the 4.0 (or 4.0 SP1) server may continuously copy the Com.cfg file from
the primary server even though the configuration file has not changed. Each time
the configuration file is copied, the following event is logged in the Windows
NT application log:

   Event ID: 670
   Source: SnaBase
   Description:
   The primary configuration file <filename> was successfully copied to
   <servername>

Normally, this event should only be logged on a backup server when the SNA Server
configuration file is changed.

Over time, this may significantly degrade performance on the SNA Server 4.0 (or
4.0 SP1) backup server, and under heavy client load, may cause the backup server
to "beep" whenever the configuration file is copied.


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs in a mixed domain with an SNA Server 3.0 primary
configuration file. The SNA Server 4.0 (or 4.0 SP1) Snacfg.dll file is not
locating the configuration file time properly in the SNA Server 3.0
configuration file, which causes the 4.0 (or 4.0 SP1) backup server to copy the
file even though it has not changed.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft SNA
Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

   File Name     Date       Time
   ------------------------------
   Snacfg.dll   08/12/98  11:32AM

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above files
may also contain additional files.


WORKAROUND
==========

Upgrade the primary SNA Server to version 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 4.0 and 4.0
SP1.
