The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the differences in functionality between the Auto-rudder
feature in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, the Auto-coordination feature in
Microsoft Flight Simulator 98, and the Auto-coordination feature in Microsoft
Flight Simulator for Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you enable the Auto-rudder or Auto-coordination feature in Flight Simulator
98/2000, the feature automatically attempts to stabilize the plane when you
bank. Auto-rudder or Auto-Coordination adjusts the rudder only slightly, giving
you more flight stability at the cost of maneuverability.

When you enable the Auto-coordination feature in Flight Simulator for Windows 95,
the rudder moves with the ailerons. This gives you greater maneuverability at
the cost of flight stability.

To enable or disable the Auto-rudder feature in Flight Simulator 2000:

1. On the Aircraft menu, click Realism Settings.

2. Under "Flight controls", click to clear or select the Auto-rudder check box,
   and then click the CHECK MARK button.

To enable or disable the Auto-coordination feature in Flight Simulator 98 or
Flight Simulator 95:

1. On the Aircraft menu, click Aircraft Settings.

2. On the Realism tab, click to clear or select the Auto-coordination check box,
   and then click OK.

feature to the product design team, please send an e-mail message to
