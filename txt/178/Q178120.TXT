TITLE   :PPT7: Cannot Change Color of Embossed Text in PowerPoint 4.0 Fil
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbdta kbconversion

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a PowerPoint for Windows version 4.0 presentation in Microsoft
PowerPoint for Windows 95 version 7.0, the color of text that has emboss
character formatting applied to it cannot be changed.

CAUSE
=====

In PowerPoint 7.0, text to which you have applied embossed formatting retains
the true characteristics of embossing. That is, the text picks up the color of
the material to which the embossing has been applied. In PowerPoint 7.0 this is
the background color of the slide. This functionality is different from
PowerPoint 4.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, change the background color of your slide by
following these steps:

1. Right-click outside of any object bounding box, and then click Custom
   Background on the menu that appears.

2. In the Fill Color list, click the down arrow and select the color you want.

3. Click Apply to apply the color to the current slide. Or, click Apply To All
   to apply the color to all the slides in the presentation.

======
