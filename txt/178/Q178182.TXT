PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles

KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbmm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 97 Deluxe for Windows 
 - Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access Online features of Encarta 1997 Encyclopedia for
Windows, you may receive the following error message:

   The registration wizard cannot run because the information it requires from
   the system is either unavailable or incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Encarta 97 cannot locate your Web browser.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, specify the correct path to your Web browser in the
Encarta Settings. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Start Encarta 97.

2. Click Encyclopedia Articles.

3. On the Options menu, click Settings.

   If You Are Using Windows 95/98
   ------------------------------

   If you are using Windows 95/98, click Reset, and then click OK. This
   configures Encarta to use the Windows default Web browser.

   These Web browsers include Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 and 4.0, Netscape
   Navigator 3.0 and 4.0, and AOL 3.0 for Windows 95.

   To determine which Web browser is set as the default Web browser in Windows,
   follow these steps:
   1. Click Start, and then click Run.

   2. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK:

   http://encarta.msn.com

      The Web browser that starts is your default Web browser.

      If you receive an error message similar to the following

   Cannot find the file 'http://encarta.msn.com'

      a default Web browser is not set in Windows. If you install (or reinstall)
      a 32-bit Web browser, it is automatically set as the default Web browser
      in Windows.

   If You Are Using a 16-bit Web Browser
   -------------------------------------

   If you are using a 16-bit Web browser (a browser designed to be used with
   Windows 3.1), click Choose Web Browser. In the Choose Web Browser window,
   navigate to and then open the folder that contains your Web browser.

   If you use Netscape Navigator, the path to the Web browser is usually:

      c:\Netscape\Netscape.exe

   If you use Internet Explorer, the path to the Web browser is usually one of
   the following:

      c:\Iexplore\Iexplore.exe

   -or-

      c:\Program Files\Microsoft Internet\Iexplore.exe

   -or-

      c:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\Iexplore.exe

   If you do not know the location of your Web browser, contact the company that
   provided you with the browser.

   Click the Web browser you want to use with Encarta, click Open, and then click
   OK.

   NOTE: You cannot select America Online (AOL) Web browsers for Windows 3.1
   using the Choose Web Browser option. This also applies to the AOL 3.0 for
   Windows 95 "browser only" upgrade, which also uses a 16-bit Web browser.
