======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are performing a server-based Setup (SBS) of Windows 95, after you
accept the End User License Agreement you may receive the following error
message:

   Error SU995034 -- Invalid INF file (0x13aa)

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Setup attempts to place temporary files into an
invalid temporary folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, specify the temporary folder for Setup to use
during the SBS. To do so, use the following command

   setup <drive>:\<filename.inf> /t:<path>\<folder>

where <drive> is the location of the .inf file that may, or may not be in
the same location as Setup.exe, <filename.inf> is the batch file generated
by the Batch.exe program, and <path> and <folder> specify the path
to and name of the temporary folder for Windows 95 to use during Setup.

For example, you might use a command similar to:

   setup c:\msbatch.inf /t:c:\temp
