-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

You can monitor the progress of directory replication between two servers using
"Pending Replication Synchronizations" and "Remaining Replication Updates."
These are MSExchangeDS counters in Performance Monitor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sometimes in large organizations, it is useful to have an idea of the progress
that directory replication is making when the entire directory is being
replicated, such as in the case of a new server installation. To monitor the
progress of replication using Performance Monitor, select MSExchangeDS as the
Object and "Pending Replication Synchronizations" and "Remaining Replication
Updates" as the Counters.
