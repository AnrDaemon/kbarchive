When you configure a newsfeed on a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 computer,
importing an active text file may cause an Access Violation. An active text file
is a list of the newsgroups available from the newsfeed provider for inbound
newsfeeds. Selecting a large number of folders to be imported from the Active
text file in the Newsfeed Configuration Wizard will cause this access violation
to occur.

version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
