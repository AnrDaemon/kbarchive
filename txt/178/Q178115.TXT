SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Measurement Equivalents InterActivity "How many millimeters in a
mile?" in Microsoft Encarta 98 Encyclopedia for Windows, when you type a number
in the Miles box, the equivalent measurement in the Feet box is incorrect.

For example, when you type "1" in the Miles box, "5,820" is displayed in the Feet
box. There are actually 5,280 feet in a mile.

NOTE: When you type a number in the Feet box, the equivalent measurement in the
Miles box is correct.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Encarta 98
Encyclopedia for Windows. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
