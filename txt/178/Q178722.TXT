The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using the Norton Antivirus program for Windows 95 and have the
AutoProtect mode enabled, the Exchange client hangs when you try to log on.

Although the system acts as if it is trying to connect to the Exchange Server
computer by displaying the Exchange client log-on logo, the system will hang
indefinitely at this point.

WORKAROUND
==========

Disabling the AutoProtect option of the Norton Antivirus program will allow you
to connect to the Exchange Server computer.
