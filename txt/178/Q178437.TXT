MORE INFORMATION
================

Back Cover Lists Incorrect Version of Internet Explorer
-------------------------------------------------------

The back cover indicates that Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.01 is included on the
companion disc. However, Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02 is included on the
companion disc.

Correction:
Back cover, bullet list in column on right:
Change: "Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.01"
To: "Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02" (without the quotation marks)


Symptom:

   When you compile the Secret application as a stand-alone executable file and
   use the executable file to encrypt and decrypt a text file, the text file may
   not be encrypted and decrypted correctly.

Cause:

   The encryption and deencryption routines do not work correctly when the
   program is optimized for fast code.

Resolution:

   When compiling the application in the Visual Basic 5.0 development
   environment, choose a compile option other than the default "Optimize for
   Fast Code."

To change the compile option, follow these steps:

1. On the Project menu, click Secret Properties.

2. Click the Compile tab.

3. Change the compile option, and then click OK.


Metric Application May Not Work Correctly With Windows NT 4.0

*********************************************************************

Symptom:

   When you attempt to run the Metric application under Microsoft Windows NT
   4.0, you may receive the following error

   This file is not a Windows Help file.

   followed by

   A newer version of Help is needed to read this Help file.

Cause:

   The Metric application uses the WinExec API function to launch WinHelp.
   WinExec is provided for compatibility with earlier versions of Windows.

Workaround

   Replace all occurrences of the WinExec API function with the CreateProcess
   API function. The Declare statement for the CreateProcess API function, as
   with most API functions, can be found in Win32api.txt.
