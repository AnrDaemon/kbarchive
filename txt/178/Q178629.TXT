SUMMARY
=======

The Exchange Forms Designer does not provide a way to launch the main window of
a form in a maximized state. Maximizing the form in the design environment and
installing the form does not allow you to set the Window State property to
maximized.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set the window state property of the main form window, perform the following
steps:

1. After you install the form, open the form's project (.vbp) files in Visual
   Basic. These files are located in the <Form Name>.vb directory.

2. Open the Main window form named Window1.frm.

3. From the View menu, select Properties.

4. In the Properties dialog box, set the value of the Window State property to
   Maximized.

5. Select Save Project from the File menu.

6. From the File menu, select Make EXE file to re-compile the executable. When
   prompted, choose Yes to replace the existing file.

At this point the .exe file has been updated with the new property. The next step
is to reinstall the updated .exe into the form library or public folder into
which it was originally installed. You can do this by using the Forms Manager in
the Microsoft Exchange client and clicking the Install button. Then, point to
the .cfg file for the form that you just customized. The Forms Manager will then
prompt you to overwrite the existing form, if you have correctly selected the
same location that the form was installed.

The next time a client launches the form, a new copy will be copied to the
computer and will start in a maximized state.
