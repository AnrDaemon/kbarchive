TITLE   :XADM: Event ID 1160 and Exchange Server Performance
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following event may be displayed in the Windows NT Event Viewer Application
log of the Exchange Server computer:

   Event:1160
   Source:MSExchangeIS
   Type:Error
   Category:General
   Description:
   Database resource failure error -1011 occurred in function
   JTAB_BASE::EcPrepareUpdate while accessing the database.

CAUSE
=====

This error may be reported if the Performance Optimizer is run and, in the
Memory Usage properties, the value for Limit Memory Usage to <value>MB is
set to something other than zero (0).

Because this value sets the limit on how much memory all of Microsoft Exchange
has to use, the lower the value, the more likely this error message is to be
displayed. If this value is set too low, for example, to 25, the services will
run, but after a short time the server's performance will degrade. Shutting down
the service will take a long time as well.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, run Microsoft Exchange Performance Optimizer and reset
the <value> to zero (0).

MORE INFORMATION
================
