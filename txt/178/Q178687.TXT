TITLE   :WINS Resolution Is Automatically Disabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::2,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork osr2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enable Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) resolution in the TCP/IP
Properties dialog box, WINS resolution may be automatically disabled when you
restart your computer.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you specify a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) address in the Primary WINS Server box, but not in the
Secondary WINS Server box.

RESOLUTION
==========

If your network has only one WINS server, you must specify its TCP/IP address in
both the Primary WINS Server and Secondary WINS Server boxes. To do so, follow
these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Network.

3. On the Configuration tab, click TCP/IP in the list of installed network
   components, and then click Properties.

4. On the WINS Configuration tab, click Enable WINS Resolution.

5. Type the WINS server's TCP/IP address in both the Primary WINS Server and
   Secondary WINS Server boxes.

6. Click OK, click OK again, and then restart your computer when you are
   prompted to do so.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WINS servers maintain a database that maps TCP/IP addresses to network basic
input/output system (NetBIOS) names (also known as computer names). A network
can have several WINS servers that WINS clients can contact when they need to
resolve a TCP/IP address to a NetBIOS name.
