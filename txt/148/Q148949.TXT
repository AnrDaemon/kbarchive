SUMMARY
=======

If an inventory package is created and a directory path is defined with the
file, the file will never be located and/or collected from the client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create an inventory package:

1. Open the Packages window and choose "New."

2. From the Package Properties window, choose "Inventory." This presents the
   Setup Package For Inventory window.

3. Check the Inventory This Package box and choose "Add AND..." to present the
   File Properties window.

4. Define the file name of the file you want to inventory on the client. For
   example, Autoexec.bat.)

5. Check "Collect This File" if you want SMS to retrieve a copy of the file to
   the server.

6. Click "OK" until you return to the Packages window.

NOTE: There is no job required to distribute inventory packages to clients; this
is done automatically.

In step 4, if a directory path is included with the file name (for example,
"C:\Autoexec.bat"), the file would not be found or collected by the SMS Client
when inventory was collected.
