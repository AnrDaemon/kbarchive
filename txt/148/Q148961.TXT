TITLE   :XADM: Event ID 9037 Advising Increased JET Tables
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Exchange Server information store, the following
error appears in the Windows NT Event Log:

   Event:9037
   Source:MSExchangeIS Private
   Type:Error
   Category:None
   Description:

   No database session was available to satisfy a request. The registry value
   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPrivate\ Sessions
   may be set too low for the level of activity on this server.

CAUSE
=====

This event ID is caused by slow response times from calls made to JET by the
information store. By default, the information store opens 60 JET tables during
initialization. In some cases this may not be adequate. Event ID 9037 is an
error from the MSExchangeIS warning that the number of tables should be
increased on the specific server receiving the error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Increase the number of JET tables by adding the following registry setting under
the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under the following subkey:

   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPrivate

1. Highlight the ParametersPrivate key. From the Edit menu, select Add Value.
   Add Value Name of "Sessions" and select Data Type as REG_DWORD. Select OK.
   Add value of 70 in Data dialog box and select Decimal. Choose OK.

2. Restart the MSExchangeIS and monitor for the 9037 Event ID.

   If this Event ID occurs again you will want to increase the sessions again
   until the error has been eliminated. Each Jet table that is opened will
   consume additional RAM on the machine so you will not want to configure this
   beyond what is necessary to avoid the error.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This related error can also be generated by the MSExchange Public IS.

   Event:9038
   Source:MSExchangeIS Public
   Type:Error
   Category:None
   Description:

   No database session was available to satisfy a request. The registry value
   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPublic\ Sessions may
   be set too low for the level of activity on this server.

If this error occurs, the same changes outlined above apply. However, the
"Sessions" addition should be added under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under
the following subkey:

   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPublic
