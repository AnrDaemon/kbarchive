TITLE   :Poor Sound Quality with Future Domain 850-Series Controllers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Future Domain TMC-850, TMC-850M, TMC-850MER, or TMC- 850MEX
SCSI controller with the Future Domain TMC-850/M/MER/MEX SCSI Host Adapter
driver included with Windows 95, you may experience poor sound quality in some
multimedia programs. This problem is known to occur with the following
multimedia programs, but the problem is not program- specific:

 - George Shrinks

 - Infopedia

CAUSE
=====

This is a known problem that can occur with the Future Domain SCSI controllers
listed above when the corresponding protected-mode drivers included with Windows
95 are used. The Future Domain 850-series SCSI controllers are 8-bit controllers
that may experience performance problems with more intensive multimedia
programs, even when the real-mode drivers included with the controller are used.
However, this poor performance is more pronounced when the protected-mode
drivers included with Windows 95 are used.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use the real-mode drivers included with the Future
Domain SCSI controller and your CD-ROM drive instead of the protected-mode
drivers included with Windows 95. For information about how to do so, consult
the documentation included with the devices, or contact the manufacturer. Note
that when you are using a real-mode driver for the CD-ROM drive, you must also
load the Mscdex.exe file located in the Windows\Command folder from the
Autoexec.bat file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
