SUMMARY
=======

You can open a PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0, presentation in
PowerPoint 4.0 by installing a translator on the computer on which PowerPoint
4.0 is installed. The translator that you need to use is available with the
PowerPoint Viewer for version 7.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the translator, use the following steps:

1. Locate the PowerPoint 7.0 Viewer files. If you have PowerPoint 7.0 on disk,
   one disk is labeled "PowerPoint Viewer and Translator disk."

   If you have PowerPoint 95 on CD-ROM, the files are located in the
   Ppview\Viewdisk folder.

2. Double-click Vsetup.exe to start the Setup program.

3. A dialog box appears asking if you want to install the Viewer and/or the
   Translator. Click the options you want to install and click OK.

4. Click OK once Setup is complete.

Your computer is now set up to open PowerPoint 7.0 presentations in PowerPoint
4.0.

The PowerPoint 7.0 Viewer and Translator can be installed on computers running
Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups 3.1x. The Viewer and Translator can open
all of the previous versions of PowerPoint in addition to PowerPoint 7.0 (the
version of PowerPoint that cannot be accessed with the translator is PowerPoint
for Macintosh 2.0).
