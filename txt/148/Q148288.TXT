SUMMARY
=======

TP4 is an OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) connection-oriented protocol used with
a Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP). TP4 includes the following features:

 - Uses CLNP network service provider based on ISO 8348

 - Provides guaranteed reliable delivery of packets using sequence numbers

 - Ensures data integrity by using checksums

 - Re-transmits corrupted or lost packets

 - Similiar to TCP

This protocol is available for Microsoft Windows NT Server on the Microsoft
Exchange Server version 4.0 compact disc in the \TP4SETUP directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the TP4 protocol, copy all the platform-specific files under the
TP4SETUP directory to your hard drive. In Control Panel Network, click Add
Software. For Network Software, select "<Other> Requires disk from
manufacturer" (without quotes) and specify the location of the T4 protocol
files.

One way to troubleshoot a TP4 connectivity problem is to use a network analyzer,
such as a Network General Sniffer. Microsoft Network Monitor currently does not
include a TP4 parser. However, a TP4 capture is displayed as LLC frames, which
can be used to diagnose any problem. No TP4 Ping utilities are included on the
Exchange Server 4.0 compact disc.
