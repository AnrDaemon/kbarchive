TITLE   :Cannot Restore DoubleSpace-Compressed Backup with MS-DOS 6.22
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER::6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfile kbtool msdos kbgraphxlinkcritical

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you back up files with compression using Msbackup.exe or Mwbackup.exe using
MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 and you then install MS-DOS 6.22, you may not be able to
restore your compressed backup.

CAUSE
=====

In order to restore the backup, the MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 Dblspace.bin file and the
Drvspace.mr1 file must be available on your hard disk.

NOTE: When you upgrade MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 to MS-DOS 6.22, the Dblspace.bin file
should be left on the hard disk. However, if you install MS-DOS 6.22 to a clean
hard disk, the version of Dblspace.bin from MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 is not available.
The Drvspace.mr1 file is included with the DoubleSpace Conversion Kit. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q117806 DoubleSpace Conversion Kit: Description & How to Obtain

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, Microsoft has made the Dblspace.bin file from MS-DOS
6.2 available for download.

To restore your compressed backup, follow these steps:

1. Install the DoubleSpace Conversion Kit (Dblconv.exe).

2. Download the DBL622.EXE file from the Microsoft Download Center to an empty
   folder.

3. Run the DBL622.EXE file you downloaded in step 2 by typing "dbl622" (without
   the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt.

4. Copy the Dblspace.bin file to the MS-DOS folder.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:
