TITLE   :XCLN: Appears to Hang on Start w/ Profile Dialog Open
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Profiles dialog box is open when the Microsoft Exchange client is
started, the client will appear to hang with the opening screen.

NOTE: You will not receive an error message.


CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) has a mutex on the provider
property sheet and will not let go until the Properties dialog box is closed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Close the Profiles dialog box, and you can run the Microsoft Exchange client.

Additional query words: hang properties exchange
