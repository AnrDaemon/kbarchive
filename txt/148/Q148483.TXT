TITLE   :XCLN: Prev/Next Unavailable After Open from Notify Dialog
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange allows you to activate a new mail notification dialog box on
the General tab (on the Tools menu, click Options). When you select this option,
the Next and Previous toolbar buttons become unavailable when a new message is
delivered.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. The message is being delivered by new mail
notification. It therefore has no message site. The next and previous buttons
are disabled accordingly.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Do not activate the new mail notification dialog box.

 - Close the message, then reopen it. The Next and Previous message functions
   will then be active.
