SUMMARY
=======

This article explains why, depending on the Directory Replication topology, the
time required to replicate directory changes to all parts of a Microsoft
Exchange Organization may be several days.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Consider the following two Directory Replication topologies.

Topology A: Hub

Site X  <------->  Site W   <------> Site Z
                      ^
                      |
                      |
                      V
                    Site Y

Topology B: Cascade

Site W  <----> Site X  <---> Site Y  <-----> Site Z

In each of the above topologies, the arrows indicate a directory replication
connector. Assume that each connector is scheduled to replicate at one time
during the day.

In Topology A, if a new mailbox is added to Site X, the maximum delay for that
directory entry to be propagated to all the other Sites would be 2 days (one day
for each directory replication connector hop).

In Topology B, if a new mailbox was added to Site W, the maximum delay for that
directory entry to reach all the other sites (specifically Site Z) would be 3
days.

Hence, the time required to propagate directory changes to all sites in an
Exchange Organization depends on the replication schedule as well as the number
of hops involved and the number of hops depends on the Directory Replication
Topology.
