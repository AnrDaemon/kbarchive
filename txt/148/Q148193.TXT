SUMMARY
=======

When you want to change a REAL*8 variable's single-precision value in the
debugger to a number greater than the maximum positive or negative value allowed
for single-precision numbers, you must use the "D" exponent descriptor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All REAL variables are initially expressed with the single-precision "E"
exponent descriptor in the debugger. To change the value of a REAL*8 variable
containing a single-precision number to a double-precision number, increase the
size of the exponent, and change the "E" exponent descriptor to the "D" exponent
descriptor.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Build the following sample code in Developer Studio.

2. In Developer Studio, click Debug on the Build menu, and then click Step Into
   to begin the debugging process.

3. In the locals window, double-click the value associated with the Single
   variable. Replace the exponent part with "D+039" and press the ENTER key.
   This changes the value to a double-precision number.

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile options needed: /Zi

         real*8 Single

         Single = 3.40E+38

         end
