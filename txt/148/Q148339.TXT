SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Exchange Server, each user can have multiple SMTP addresses. These
addresses are automatically imported using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you import the addresses, create a .csv file that contains a
Secondary-Proxy-Addresses column header. To do this, export the addresses from
the Administrator program and modify the file to add the new column and the
secondary addresses.
