TITLE   :DHCP Server Creates Unnecessary Lease
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server makes an address offer
to a client and the client chooses an address from a different DHCP server, the
server that was not chosen keeps a DHCP lease for the offered address for 15
minutes.

CAUSE
=====

When multiple DHCP servers put out address offers to a client, the server whose
offer is not accepted goes through a cleanup procedure. This procedure should
remove the address which was temporarily set aside from the previous offer.
However, this is not the case. The cleanup procedure is not clearing the
temporarily assigned lease out of the database.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install the fix mentioned below.

The temporary lease will last for 15 minutes. If you have extra leases you can
just let the lease expire. Some companies are very short on available leases and
cannot afford this, so a correction to DHCP has been created.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT Workstation
or Server version 3.51. For information on obtaining this update, query on the
