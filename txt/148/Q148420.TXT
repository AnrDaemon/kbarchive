SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to change the password on a Microsoft Exchange or Outlook client
that is logging on to a Novell server and not being authenticated by a Windows
NT server at bootup, the following error message may occur:

   The NT Domain password could not be changed. A required action was not
   successful due to an unspecified error.

This may also occur with other clients running on other operation systems and
networking software using TCP/IP or IPX as their protocol.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do the following:

1. For NetWare clients, install the Gateway Services for NetWare on the primary
   domain controller (PDC), which has the Microsoft Exchange user accounts.

2. Ensure that the client is running the latest version of the networking files
   from the software provider.

3. Ensure that the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service is configured to start
   automatically. This can be changed in Control Panel Services.

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
   require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
   resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
   Registry Editor at your own risk.

   NOTE: Normally, registry entries are not case sensitive. However, in the case
   of both of these entries, they are case sensitive. When adding these new
   keys, be sure to match the case exactly as it is shown in Step 5.

4. Ensure that the registry on the PDC has the following entries. If these
   entries are missing, add them according to the instructions in Step 5. Look
   for the entries at the following registry key:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA

   If the PDC has NWLink installed, the entry should be:

      NetWareClientSupport:REG_DWORD:0x1

   If the PDC has TCP/IP installed, the entry should be:

      TCPIPClientSupport:REG_DWORD:0x1


   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
   require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
   resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
   Registry Editor at your own risk.

5. Add the registry values to the PDC because it is here that the Windows NT
   password is changed. To add the values:

   a. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

   b. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

      SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA

   c. On the Edit menu, click Add Value.

   d. If NWLink is installed on the PDC, type "NetWareClientSupport" (without
      the quotation marks) under Field Type.

   e. In the Data Type field, choose REG_DWORD, and click OK.

   f. In the DWORD editor, in the Data field, type "1" (without the quotation
      marks).

   g. Click OK. The new value should appear as an entry.

   h. Repeat steps a through f for TCPIPClientSupport if TCPIP is installed on
      the PDC.

   i. Restart the PDC for the changes to take effect.
