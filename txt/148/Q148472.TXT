PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The SMC EtherCard Elite Ultra (8216) is not an option to choose when you install
the SMC16 network card driver that is available from the DRVLIB subdirectory.
The HCL clearly identifies that the Driver Library on the compact disc is a
source for this driver.

If you select the "SMC EtherEZ Adapter (8416)" option, the driver installs and
works correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you try to use the SMC driver located in the DRVLIB\NETCARD\X86\SMC16
directory on the NT 3.51 Server or Workstation disc, you are presented with the
following options:

   SMC 8003E/A MCA EtherCard Plus
   SMC 8003W/A MCA EtherCard Plus
   SMC 8013EP/A MCA EtherCard Plus Elite
   SMC 8013WP/A MCA EtherCard Plus Elite
   SMC EtherEZ Adapter (8416)

If you examine the OEMSETUP.INF file in the DRVLIB\NETCARD\X86\SMC16 directory,
the comment shows that this driver is for the SMC Ultra 8216 network adapter.
However, the Options section in the INF file does not define an entry for the
8216 as seen by the available options listed above.

After choosing the SMC EtherEZ Adapter (8416) option, you are prompted for the
port address the adapter is using. Once this is entered, the driver will install
and function correctly for the SMC EtherCard Elite Ultra (8216).
