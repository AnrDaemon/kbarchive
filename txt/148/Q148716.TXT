PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You might receive the following error message during installation of Microsoft
Exchange Server:

   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup

   Unable to configure the Windows NT Natural Language for the teletex codepage.

   Access is denied. ID C0020005

CAUSE
=====

This error message usually occurs because the System32\C_20261.nls file is
marked read-only. It will also occur if the following registry entry is not
present:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NLs
                     \20261:REG_SZ:C_20261.NLS

WORKAROUND
==========

First, verify that Windows NT Service Pack 4 (SP4) has been installed. Then make
sure that C_20261.nls is the file that came with SP4 and it is not marked
read-only. Finally, make sure that the registry entry above is present.
