TITLE   :IPX RAS Clients Unable To View or Access NetBIOS Resources
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.00 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a Windows NT 3.5X Remote Access Server (RAS) using your RAS
client software, which is configured to use only the IPX/SPX Compatible
Transport (NWLINK) protocol, NetBIOS resources such as computer names, network
shares or printers from Server Message Block (SMB) based clients are not
viewable.

When you use Net View \\<servername>, the following error message appears:

   System error 53 has occurred.
   The network path was not found.

RESOLUTION
==========

By default, the RAS server is only configured to forward NetBIOS broadcast over
IPX from the RAS client to the LAN, but not from the LAN to the client. To do
this, you must enable two-way broadcasting of type 20 (14h) packets (NetBIOS
over IPX).

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and locate the following Registry subkey
   in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree:

   \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NWlnkRip\Parameters

2. Select the following value: NetBiosRouting

3. From the Edit menu, select DWORD.

4. Change the data from 2 to 6.

   The following lists the data values you can use for NetBiosRouting:

   0 = Do not forward broadcasts(default-in order to reduce network
       traffic).

   2 = Enables forwarding of NetBIOS packets from remote client to the
       LAN.

   4 = Enables forwarding of NetBIOS packets from the LAN to the remote
       client.

   6 = Enables two-way forwarding of NetBIOS packets between remote
       clients and LAN.

5. Click OK and quit Registry Editor.

6. Shut down and restart Windows NT.

NOTE: Forwarding type 14h packets significantly increases network and RAS
traffic. It is efficient to enable the NetBEUI protocol over the RAS connection
rather than enabling two-way broadcasting of type 20 (14h) packets.
