TITLE   :FIX: Using #define NOGDI Results in Compilation Syntax Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler

KEYWORDS:kbGenInfo kbVC kbVC500fix kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 2.2, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling a source file that contains the following code:

      #define NOGDI
      #include <windows.h>

results in several syntax errors such as these:

   winuser.h(8577) : error C2501: 'LOGFONTA' : missing decl-specifiers
   winuser.h(8577) : error C2146: syntax error : missing ';'  before
   identifier 'lfFont'

CAUSE
=====

GDI-specific types like LOGFONTA are not defined when NOGDI is defined. However,
header files like Winuser.h and Imm.h have structures that contain the
GDI-specific types without the surrounding "#ifndef NOGDI"/"#endif" pair. The
compiler generates syntax error for the GDI-specific types inside these
structures.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use #define NOGDI, or edit the system header files that produce the
syntax errors to add the "#ifndef NOGDI"/"#endif" pair around the structures
that contain the GDI-specific types.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.
