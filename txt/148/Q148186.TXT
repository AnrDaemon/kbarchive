SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0,
Reference Manual, Page 453, incorrectly describes the effect of using a RETURN
statement in the main program unit. It says, "A RETURN statement in the main
program is treated as a STOP statement with no message parameter." This
reference to and usage of RETURN statements is considered obsolete. Instead, a
RETURN statement in the main program unit will cause the following compile-time
error:

   error FOR2718: RETURN is only allowed in SUBROUTINEs and FUNCTIONs

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code illustrates the problem:

   CC Compile options needed: none

         print *, 'hello, world'
         return         ! Compilation error
         end
