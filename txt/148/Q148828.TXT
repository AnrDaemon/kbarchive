TITLE   :Err Msg: Dlchlp.exe Is Required to Support 16-Bit Applications
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork msnets win95 kbAPI kbDLC kbSDKPlatform kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install a server-based Windows 95 installation using the Microsoft
32-bit DLC protocol (MSDLC32), Dlc.vxd may report the following error message:

   DLCHP.EXE is required to support 16-bit applications. It must be loaded from
   Autoexec.bat.

CAUSE
=====

This error can be caused by either of the following conditions:

 - Net.exe is not being loaded before Dlchlp.exe is being run in the
   Autoexec.bat file.

 - The Autoexec.bat file does not contain the correct path to the Dlchlp.exe
   file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the Autoexec.bat file. Make sure that Net.exe is loaded before
Dlchlp.exe, and that the path for the Dlchlp.exe file is correct. The path for
the Dlchlp.exe file should point to the shared folder on the network server from
which you run Windows 95. For example, the Autoexec.bat file may contain

   net.exe
   <drive>:\netsetup\dlchlp.exe

where <drive> is the network server from which you run Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default installation of MSDLC32 supports 16-bit DLC programs that require
Dlchlp.exe to be loaded in the Autoexec.bat file.

In a server-based setup, the real-mode network components must be loaded and a
drive mapped to the shared Windows 95 installation before Dlchlp.exe can be
loaded.
