TITLE   :Invalid Audit and History Records
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAudit smsaudit

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

History records maintained by Systems Management Server (SMS) begin to get
cluttered and often contradictory as successive audits are run on files which
may have been moved, or even deleted. At this time, the only way to be sure you
have accurate records is to run DBCLEAN, and delete all audit files, then re-run
the audit jobs.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is that every part of an Audited Software row is a key field. Even
though the package number and file names may always be the same, the "Time
Collected" is always different. Thus, the Data Loader does not correctly
identify and map the previous instances to the new ones, and assumes all the
data is new.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
