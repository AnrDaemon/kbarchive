SYMPTOMS
========

When you programmatically set the Value property of a text box that has its
ControlSource property set to a field in a table, a new record will be added to
the table if the record pointer is positioned at the end of file.

If the Value property of a text box is to be set programmatically, use the EOF()
function to determine if the record pointer is positioned at the end of file
before setting the Value property.

the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
