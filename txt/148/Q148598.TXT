TITLE   :PPT7: Menu Text Jumbled or Out of Place in PowerPoint for Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In PowerPoint for Windows 95, the menu text or the commands on the menus may
appear in the wrong place or may appear jumbled. For example, the order of the
File, Edit, View, Insert, and Format menus may be changed, or they may not
appear in English.

Note that you will not experience this behavior in other Office programs.

CAUSE
=====

This problem will occur if the Ppintl.dll file is corrupted. This file is
located in the \Powerpnt or in the \Msoffice\Powerpnt folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Rename Ppintl.dll to Ppintl.old or Ppintl.bak.

2. Run PowerPoint or Office Setup.

3. In the Maintenance Mode dialog box, click Reinstall.

4. Follow the instructions on your screen.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Ppintl.dll contains the text strings that must be translated for international
versions of PowerPoint. This driver is in part responsible for the appearance of
menu names, commands on menus, Tip Of The Day text, alerts, and so on. Because
of this, it may produce strange behavior if it is corrupted.
