======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The ClassWizard, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Developer Studio crashes or abruptly terminates when attempting to add a new
class from an OLE TypeLib with the ClassWizard.

CAUSE
=====

ClassWizard allocates a 1024 byte buffer to store member function prototypes
based on the information it finds in the specified OLE TypeLib. If the
ClassWizard-generated prototype for a member function exceeds this limit,
Developer Studio will crash or abruptly terminate.

This problem only occurs when attempting to create a new class from an OLE
TypeLib, where one or more of the automation methods contains a large argument
list. For example, both Microsoft Schedule+ 7.0 and Microsoft Project 4.0 expose
automation methods with large argument lists. Attempting to create a new class
from either the Schedule+ type library (SP7EN32.OLB) or the Microsoft Project
type library (PJ4EN32.OLB) may cause Developer Studio to crash.

When the crash occurs, you will notice that a header (.H) file and an
implementation (.CPP) file were added to your project's directory. These files
will most likely be corrupted and should be deleted from your project directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Avoid using the ClassWizard to generate new classes with the previously listed
type libraries. Microsoft has provided a self-extracting file, called
TLBWRAP.EXE, that contains the COleDispatchDriver-derived classes that wrap the
automation objects exposed by the SP7EN32.OLB and PJ4EN32.OLB type libraries.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:

   Tlbwrap.exe
