TITLE   :CGI Scripts Compiled w/16-bit C Compilers Fail to Run on IIS
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:1.0 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to run a CGI script on (Internet Information Server) IIS from a Web
Browser using http://<ServerName>/Directory
path>/<FileName.exe>?,, you may get the following error:

   HTTP/1.0 500 Server Error (The handle is invalid.)

CAUSE
=====

CGI scripts compiled with 16-bit C compilers may fail to execute on IIS.

For example, if you compile and build an executable file out of the following C
language source code using a 16-bit C compiler, and run the .exe file from a
MS-DOS window of a Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51, the correct
HTML output will send to the standard out. However if you place the same
executable file in the Script directory of the IIS server and try to execute the
same executable file from a web browser using
http://<ServerName>/Directory path>/<FileName.exe>?, it will fail
to generate to web page.

   #include <stdio.h>

   void main()
   {
      printf( "Content-type: text/html\n\n" );
      printf( "<BODY BGCOLOR=\"#FFFFF0\" TEXT=\"#0000FF\">" );
      printf( "<TITLE>This is a Test page</TITLE>" );
      printf( "<h2>Hello World.</h2><br>" );
      printf( "<h1><center>End of the test page.</center></h1>" );
      printf( "</BODY>\n" );
   }

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem compile and build the C Language Source code using a
32-bit C compiler, such as Microsoft C++ 4.0 or C++ 2.0.
