TITLE   :BUG: Debugger Cannot Display Renamed Module Variables
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Renamed USE-associated module variables cannot be referenced or displayed in the
debugger. The debugger will only reference and display the original module
variable names, not the renamed module variable aliases created with the USE
statement's module variable renaming specifier (=>).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the sample code provided, the module's public variable G is renamed by the
USE statement and is known in the internal procedure as the alias access
variable H. However, the debugger incorrectly reports the wrong USE variable G
in the locals window, so attempting to view the value of H in the watch window
causes the message, "undefined variable."

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Build the following sample code in Developer Studio:

   C Compile options needed: /Zi

         MODULE RED
           REAL G
         END MODULE

         PROGRAM RENAME

         USE RED, H=>G
         REAL A

         H = 1.0
         A = GREEN()

         WRITE (*,*) A

         CONTAINS
           FUNCTION GREEN
             REAL GREEN, S
             S = H
             GREEN = S
           END FUNCTION

         END PROGRAM

2. To begin a debugging session in the Developer Studio, click Debug on the
   Build menu, and then click Step Into.

3. Step into the internal function GREEN.

4. View the locals window.

5. Type in the variable name H in the watch window.
