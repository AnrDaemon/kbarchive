TITLE   :XADM: Err Msg: Operation Terminated with Error -1032
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Eseutil.exe (Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5) or the Edbutil.exe
(Exchange Server 4.0) utility that ships with Microsoft Exchange Server to
compact the database or to make storage contiguous, the following error may
appear:

   Operation terminated with error -1032

CAUSE
=====

The appropriate Windows NT service must be stopped before Eseutil/Edbutil is
run.

RESOLUTION
==========

Which service needs to be stopped depends on whether you are running Eseutil/
Edbutil against the directory or the information store. For the directory, stop
the Microsoft Exchange Directory service. For the information stores, stop the
Microsoft Exchange Information Store service.

If the services appear to be stopped, but error -1032 still occurs, change all
affected services to manual and restart the computer. This will ensure the
service is stopped. However, after Eseutil.exe/Edbutil.exe runs, you must change
the services back to automatic.

The following error message may also indicate a file permission or attribute
problem:

   Running error.exe -1032
   Error -1032 (0xfffffbf8) = JET_errFileAccessDenied

Stated: Permission issues can also cause this error message:

   Error -1032 (0xfffffbf8) = JET_errFileAccessDenied
