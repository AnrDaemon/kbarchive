=======

This article contains frequently asked questions about using V-Chat on MSN, The
Microsoft Network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. What is an avatar?

   A. An avatar is the character that represents you in the V-Chat.

2. Q. How does V-Chat choose an initial avatar?

   A. Each environment uses an initial avatar that is assigned to you the first
   time you enter a V-Chat. You can change your avatar by clicking Select Avatar
   on the Avatar menu. V-Chat remembers your avatar and uses it the next time
   you enter that V-Chat.

3. Q. How do I move around in V-Chat?

   A. You can navigate in V-Chat using either the mouse or the keyboard. There is
   no joystick support.

   To use the mouse, press and hold down the left mouse button as you move the
   mouse. To go up and down, press and hold down the CTRL key and left mouse
   button as you move the mouse.

   To use the keyboard, use the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys to go forward and
   backwards. For up and down travel, press and hold down the CTRL key as you
   press the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys. Holding down the LEFT ARROW or RIGHT
   ARROW key spins you around.

4. Q. Why am I unable to see myself in the Environment View window?

   A. V-Chat supports both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional spaces. In a
   2-dimensional space, you see yourself both in the self-view window and in the
   V-Chat Environment View window. In a 3-dimensional space, you see yourself in
   the self-view window only. The Environment View window is first-person
   point-of-view, meaning that you are looking at this space through your own
   eyes.

5. Q. How can I build my own V-Chat space?

   A. The V-Chat Building Kit, which enables you to create custom V-Chat spaces,
   is available only to MSN forum managers and content providers.

6. Q. How can I create my own custom avatars?

   A. Use the Avatar Wizard, and follow the Avatar User's Guide instructions
   available on MSN in the V-Chat Forum.

7. Q. I accidentally published my custom avatar publicly and I meant to publish
   it privately. What can I do?

   A. Publish your avatar again using the same name, making sure to publish it
   privately. This overwrites your initial public avatar.
