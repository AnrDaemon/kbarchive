TITLE   :Upgrading From Visual FoxPro 3.0 to Visual FoxPro 3.0b
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00 3.00b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you install Visual FoxPro 3.0b on a system that currently has a copy of
Visual FoxPro 3.0 installed, do not install Visual FoxPro 3.0b on top of the
existing Visual FoxPro 3.0 installation. Remove Visual FoxPro 3.0 first before
installing Visual FoxPro 3.0b.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Upgrade from Visual FoxPro 3.0 to Visual FoxPro 3.0b
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Run Visual FoxPro 3.0 Setup, and choose the Remove All option. To run Visual
   FoxPro 3.0 setup, click the Visual FoxPro setup icon in the Visual FoxPro
   program group, or run setup from the Visual FoxPro CD-ROM or from disk one of
   the Visual FoxPro setup disks.

2. If Visual FoxPro 3.0 was the professional edition, delete the \Vfp\Distrib
   subdirectory.

3. If Visual FoxPro 3.0 was the professional edition, delete all occurrences of
   the following files:

   Dkcontrl.dbf
   Dkcontrl.cdx
   Wzsetup.ini

Now, you can safely run Visual FoxPro 3.0b setup. Visual FoxPro 3.0b can be
installed in the same directory as Visual FoxPro 3.0 or in a new directory.

Note for Professional Edition Users
-----------------------------------

The name of the extended support library file (Vfp300.esl) is the same for both
Visual FoxPro 3.0 and Visual FoxPro 3.0b. To avoid any possible confusion, there
should be only one version of the ESL file located on your system, and it should
be the Visual FoxPro 3.0b version. All of the .exe files that were built in
Visual FoxPro 3.0 should be rebuilt in Visual FoxPro 3.0b before you run them.
