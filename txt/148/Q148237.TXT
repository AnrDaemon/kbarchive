TITLE   :IDC: Error Performing Query Connecting to SQL Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT: 1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you execute an IDC script that connects to a remote SQL Server, one of the
following error messages appear from the web browser:

   Error Performing Query

   [State=01000][Error=1385][Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server
   Driver][dbnmpntw]ConnectionOpen (CreateFile()).

   [State=08001][Error=1385][Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Unable
   to connect to data source

   -or-

   [State=01000][Error=1326][Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server
   Driver][dbnmpntw]ConnectionOpen (CreateFile()).

   [State=08001][Error=1326][Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Unable
   to connect to data source

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of one or all of the following:

 - The user account IUSR_<Server Name> (where <Server Name> is the
   name of your Internet Information Server) does not have the "Access this
   computer from the network" user right configured on the SQL Server.

 - The Internet Information Server and the SQL Server are on different domains
   and the IUSR_<Server Name> account does not exist in the SQL Server's
   local user database or domain.

 - The Internet Information Server and SQL Server are on the same domain;
   however, the Internet Information Server is installed on a Server (non-domain
   controller) and the SQL Server is installed on a Domain Controller. The
   IUSR_<Server Name> account does not exist on the domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one or all of the following:

 - Grant the IUSR_<Server Name> the "Access this computer from network"
   user right on the SQL Server.

 - If there is a trust established between the domains, whereas the Internet
   Information Server in the Resource domain, then you can set the "Username:"
   value under "Anonymous Logon" to be MASTERDOMAIN\username (where username is
   a user account that was created on the Master Domain).

   If there is not a trust relationship involved, you must create an
   IUSR_<Server Name> account on the remote domain and give it the
   appropriate rights. (See first resolution above)

   Note: If there is no trust, the username and password in one domain must match
   the username and password on the other domain.

 - Modify the "Username:" value under "Anonymous Logon" in the Microsoft
   Internet Service Manager to use the following format:

      DOMAIN\IUSR_<Server Name>.

   If the IUSR_<Server Name> does not exist on the domain, then create the
   account using User Manager for Domains.

 - See Q141086 in the SQL Server Knowledge Base for information on fixing a bug
   in the SQL Server 2.5 ODBC driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Internet Information Server accesses the SQL Server by first connecting to
the IPC$ share of the SQL Server. It uses the user name and password specified
for Anonymous Logon (entry is in the Service tab of Internet Service Manager).
