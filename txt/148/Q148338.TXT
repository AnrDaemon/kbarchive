2. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Phone, and then
   click Microsoft Voice.

3. Remove the Microsoft Voice shortcut from the Startup group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is not necessary to have a shortcut for Microsoft Voice in the Startup group.
Microsoft Voice is designed to load when you start Windows 95 if you left
Microsoft Voice running when you last shut down the computer. The error message
is generated when a second instance of Microsoft Voice tries to initialize when
the first instance has not completed loading.
