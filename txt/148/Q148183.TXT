TITLE   :BUG: FOR2206 Error Illegal Access of Module Member
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The USE statement's ONLY option allows access to those module members specified
in the only-list. Attempting to gain access to a module's member not specified
in the USE statement's ONLY option only-list results in a compilation error
similar to the following:

   error FOR2206: inconsistent data type for FUNCTION <function-name> from
   procedure <module-name> and procedure <procedure-name>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the following sample code, both the SETWRITEMODE() function and the $GPSET
constant are defined in the MSFLIB module although the $GPSET constant is the
only module member specified as accessible to the program unit. When compiling,
the sample code the compiler erroneously attempts to gain access to the
definition of the SETWRITEMODE() function resulting in the FOR2206 compiler
error.

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile options needed: none

         use msflib, only: $GPSET
         i = SETWRITEMODE( $GPSET )
         end
