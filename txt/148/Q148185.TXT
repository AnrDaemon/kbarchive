TITLE   :BUG: FOR3852 Syntax Error Caused by Semicolon in Source Line
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling source code that contains a line that holds only a semicolon causes
the following compile-time syntax error message:

   error FOR3852: syntax error

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Usually semicolons are used to separate FORTRAN statements on the same line.
Although not useful, the FORTRAN standard considers a semicolon on a source line
by itself to be a valid use of the language. Therefore, any source lines
containing only a semicolon should compile without any errors.

The following code illustrates the problem:

   C Compile options needed: none

         program semicolon
         ;              ! Compiler syntax error
         end

The following code demonstrates the intended use of semicolons:

   C Compile options needed: none

         program semicolon
         write(*,*) 'Hello,' ; write(*,*) ' World'
         end
