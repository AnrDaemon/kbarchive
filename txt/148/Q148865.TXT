DOCUMENT:Q148865  27-JUL-2000  [foxpro]
TITLE   :PRB: Can't Access Stored Procedures in Visual FoxPro Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for Visual FoxPro, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

From MSQuery version 2.0, if you connect to a Visual FoxPro database that
contains stored procedures, the Procedures button of the Execute SQL dialog box
is disabled. In particular, if you set up a data source to the Tastrade
database, the Procedures button is disabled although the Tastrade database
contains stored procedures. You were expecting this button to be enabled because
the database contains stored procedures.

CAUSE
=====

The Procedure button in the Execute SQL dialog of MSQuery calls the
SQLprocedures function. This function is not supported by the Visual FoxPro ODBC
driver because Visual FoxPro stored procedures cannot be executed outside of a
trigger. Therefore, the Procedures button in the Execute SQL dialog box is
disabled.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Set up a data source to the Tastrade database by following these steps:

   a. Start the ODBC Driver Manager.

   b. Click the Add button to add a driver.

   c. In the list of drivers, select the Microsoft Visual FoxPro Driver.

   d. In the data source dialog box, click the Visual FoxPro Database (.dbc) as
      the database type.

   e. Select Tastrade.dbc that is located in the Samples\Mainsamp\Data
      directory.

2. Start MSQuery 2.0.

3. On the File menu, click Execute SQL.

4. Click the Data Source button, and select the Tastrade data source.

The Procedures button in the Execute SQL dialog box is disabled.
