TITLE   :MS-DOS "For" Command Fails when Run Against an FPNW Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On your computer running Windows with the NetWare NETX.COM redirector installed,
when you run the For command (which is an internal COMMAND.COM command) against
a File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) server, the command fails after the
first pass. For example, the following command only lists the first file and
then quits:

   for %f in (*.*) do dir %f /b

CAUSE
=====

The NetWare NETX.EXE redirector causes it to get the task numbers mixed up. The
server closes all open file searches when the client sends an EndOfJob request
after the first For-loop executes. The For command fails when the client asks
for more files on a search that the client had just implicitily closed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, install the fix mentioned below.

To work around this problem, obtain the fix mentioned below.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for
NetWare version 3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack
