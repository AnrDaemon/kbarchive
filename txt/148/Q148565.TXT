SUMMARY
=======

An Exchange administrator can define the way messages may be delivered based on
the domain name of the destination. This is configured through the Internet Mail
Connector (IMC) or Internet Mail Service (IMS) Connections property page. If one
or more per domain routing is set up incorrectly, the MSExchangeIMC or
MSExchangeIMS service may fail to start with an Error 2140, as well as logging
Event IDs 4032, 4057, and 4014 in the Windows NT Event Viewer Application log.
Resolution requires correcting or removing the erroneous per domain routing
entry, which is specified in the previously listed Event Viewer entries. This is
by design.
