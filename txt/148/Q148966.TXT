TITLE   :The TN3270 Server Does Not Check for a Best LU to IP Match
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The TN3270E server does not do any checking of which LU to IP matches are better
than others.

WORKAROUND
==========

One possible workaround is to reorder the pools in the configuration. Place the
pool with the pool you want the user to use first last in the list.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base when it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example shows where the TN3270 Server Service may allocate an
user's session to a pool that the administrator did not expect:

Pool Configuration
------------------

 - Pool_A is configured to allow any workstation access. To do this, assign the
   IP Address to 0.0.0.0 and the subnet mask to 255.255.255.255 in the Edit
   Configuration for <pool_name> dialog box.

 - Pool_B is configured to only allow users on subnet 130.1.x.x. To do this,
   assign the IP Address to 130.1.x.x and the subnet mask to 255.255.0.0 in the
   Edit Configuration for <pool_name> dialog box.

The Administrator's Preference
------------------------------

   The Administrator's preference is for users to get a session through Pool_B
   first, and then Pool_A second.

The Result
----------

If a workstation from the 130.1.x.x subnet tries to make a connection to the
TN3270E Server, the TN3270E Server will not check for the best LU to IP match
causing the workstation to potentially get an LU from Pool_A.
