TITLE   :"NameNumericTail=0" Value Causes Problems for Some Programs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you add the "NameNumericTail=0" value to the registry (as documented on page
688 of the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit) and then run Windows 95 Setup,
Microsoft Plus! Setup, or the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel,
programs in the Program Files folder may no longer work correctly.

For example, if you run The Microsoft Network or Microsoft Exchange, you may
receive a "Program not found" error message with an option to locate the
program.

CAUSE
=====

When you add the "NameNumericTail=0" value to the registry, Windows 95 Setup,
Microsoft Plus! Setup, or the Add/Remove Programs tool may change the short name
for the Program Files folder. For example, if you run the Add/Remove Programs
tool after you add the "NameNumericTail=0" value to the registry, the short name
for the Program Files folder may be changed from Progra~1 to Programf.

If the short name for the Program Files folder is different from the name that
the program you are trying to run expects, the program may not be able to locate
the folders and files it needs.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

To correct this problem, follow these steps:

1. Delete the value "NameNumericTail=0" from the following registry key:

      Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem

2. Using Windows Explorer or My Computer, rename the Program Files folder to
   Programs.fld.

3. Rename the Programs.fld folder to Program Files.

Note that renaming the folder forces a new short name for the folder to be
generated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Various tools and components installed in the Program Files folder may use short
file names internally or during installation. If the short name for the Program
Files folder is different from the short name expected by a tool or component,
the problems described in this article may occur. This problem can affect any
program installed in the Program Files folder.

The "NameNumericTail=0" value is not supported in Windows 95. Although this
registry value works as expected, it can cause problems for Windows 95
components.
