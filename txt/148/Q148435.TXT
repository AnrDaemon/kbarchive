To work around this problem, do the following:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and locate the following Registry subkey
   in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree:

   \Software\Microsoft

2. From the Edit menu, select Add Key.

   String: 1

7. Click OK and quit Registry Editor.

8. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.

9. To verify that the Command Processor extensions are enabled, start the MS-DOS
   Command Prompt (CMD.EXE) and type the following:

   "assoc" (without the quotation marks)

   A list of applications currently associated with file extensions appears.

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Command Extensions to the Windows NT version of CMD.EXE are an attempt to make
CMD.EXE a more useful programming tool, while maintaining compatibility with
existing command scripts. At the same time, given the diversity of usage of the
command script language, the possibility exists that some incompatibility may be
found. So the capability exists to enable or disable the extensions, either via
the command line or via a command in a command script. This allows an escape for
any potential compatiblity problems that may be found.

The command extensions currently involve changes and/or additions to the
following commands:

 - MKDIR creates any intermediate directories in the path if needed. The percent
   (%) sign and a number in a batch script refers to all the arguments (for
   example: %1 %2 %3 %4 %5).

 - DEL /s only displays files that are deleted and not those it could not find.

 - When you invoke the SET command with a variable name, no equal sign, or
   value, the value of that variable appears. Non-executable files may be
   invoked through its file association just by typing the name of the file as a
   command. ASSOC is a new command that you can use to add, display or change
   file associations.
