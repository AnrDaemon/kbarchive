TITLE   :IIS Returns IP Address Instead of Host Name
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to an Internet Information Server from any web browser, the
Uniform Resource Location (URL) address that you enter changes. For example, the
following URL address:

   http://www.microsoft.com/devonly

changes to the following:

   http://198.105.232.5/devonly/

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you do not enter a trailing forward slash (/) to the end
of the URL address. When the web browser sends the original address, the server
responds by indicating that it has moved, along with the IP address of the site
(which is itself).

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, include a trailing forward slash (/) at the end of the
URL address.

Additional query words: prodiis path
