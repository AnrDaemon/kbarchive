PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Microsoft Windows 95 Infrared Driver (IrDA) version 1.0 in
a Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1 installation, a version conflict is reported
with the Infrared.dll file and you are prompted to keep the existing file.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1 installations already have infrared support
included. The version number of the Infrared.dll file was changed for OEM
purposes.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can safely keep the existing file or overwrite it. Because infrared support
is already included, there is no difference in functionality.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If Windows 95 was preinstalled on your computer and you have not installed
Windows 95 Service Pack 1, you can determine whether you have Windows 95 OEM
Service Release 1 by using the right mouse button to click My Computer and then
clicking Properties on the menu that appears. If the version number reported is
4.00.950a, you are using OEM Service Release 1 and you do not need to install
IrDA or any of the other Windows 95 Service Pack 1 updates or components.
