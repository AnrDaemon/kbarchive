SUMMARY
=======

The NEC Versa 4050C computer allows you to inter-exchange or swap between a
floppy disk drive and an IDE CD-ROM drive. Windows NT does not allow you to
start with any media component. For example, you cannot start Windows NT with a
floppy disk drive and then immediately restart your component with a an IDE
CD-ROM drive. A "STOP: 0x0000007B: Inaccessible Boot Device" blue screen appears
if you start with a component that has not been configured in Windows NT.

================

   Devices. If you start Windows NT with a floppy disk drive as one of your
   hardware components, see Startup for Floppy in the table below. If you start
   Windows NT with a CD-ROM drive as one of your hardware components, see
   Startup for IDE CD-ROM.
