PROD/VER::3.5,3.51

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows NT Setup on a multiprocessor IBM PC Server 320, it stops
during the second Setup disk, just after loading the keyboard driver and the
file allocation table (FAT) file system. The following Stop message appears:

   STOP 0x00000079 MISMATCHED_HAL.

RESOLUTION
==========

The manufacturer-supplied hardware abstraction layer (HAL) must be manually
specified. At the beginning of the first Setup disk, when Setup displays "Setup
is Inspecting Hardware," press F5. After a while, a message will come up saying
that Setup could not detect your computer type, or that you chose to specify the
computer type. Select Other and put in the OEM- supplied disk containing the HAL
(in this case, the IBM device driver disk). Select the only HAL presented and
continue.

This computer also comes with a SCSI II Fast Wide PCI RAID controller for which
the driver must be manually installed. Choose Custom Install instead of Express
Install. At the Mass Storage Detection section, type ESC to skip detection and
manually specify the controller. Select Other and then select the IBM-supplied
RAID driver disk.
