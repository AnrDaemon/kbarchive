The manual "Services for NetWare Networks" explains how users are
transferred to the NT Server, and how groups are created when you do a
NetWare-to-NT conversion. The manual reads in part:

   When you transfer groups to a master domain, they are created as global
   groups in the master domain and again as local groups on the server specified
   in the Servers For Migration list(page 91).

The manual is misleading. In fact, when you transfer groups to a master
domain model or domain model, global groups are created locally to the
server you are moving the accounts to. The group will still be global, and
can be added to your local group. Some companies have security issues with
adding global groups to local groups. They can write a batch file or files
in order to add users to a local group.
