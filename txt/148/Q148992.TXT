TITLE   :XADM: Cannot Perform Forklift Upgrade Using UPDATE.EXE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Service Pack installer, Update.exe, the forklift update option does not
function (update /R). The forklift update may be required in disaster recovery
scenarios that involve restoring databases from previous versions of Microsoft
Exchange Server.

CAUSE
=====

The /R switch was not enabled in the Service Pack installer, Update.exe.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 5.0
Server U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query
on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

The forklift update allows Microsoft Exchange Server files to be copied to the
installation drive and the appropriate registry entries to be made, but does not
start the core Microsoft Exchange services. This allows a restore of the
databases to take place before the services are started and the server is put
back into production.

Additional query words: crash restore
