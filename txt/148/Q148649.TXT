SUMMARY
=======

When you query a Systems Management Server database for SMSID in the Network
Table of Computer Properties, duplicate entries of the same ID appears.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the client computer logs on to the network, the history of that logon is
recorded by Systems Management Server. INVPROC compares the new entry to the
history file and sends any changes. When a new user logs on using the same
SMSID, the INVPROC then sends up the history deltas to reflect the new logon
name (If there are no HMS or SMH files to compare, a new record is sent to the
SQL Server). It is sent with two fields: IDENT and NETWORK. The IDENT field has
a single entry only. The NETWORK field can have multiple entries. This process
is possibly the cause of duplicate SMSID's. If you query under IDENT, the
problem does not occur.

If there is no history file, INVPROC sends a RESYNC record to DATALOADER, which
forces the computer inventory to be synchronized only with the incoming current
inventory.

To get around the inventory resync, the HMS and SMH files are removed. This
action may create the multiple rows in the NETWORK section queries. INVPROC does
not have the base line to generate the removal of the older NETWORK group.

If you have a MIF with a group that is not currently in the SQL database, it is
added. If you are missing a group in the MIF and the SQL database has the group,
it is removed.
