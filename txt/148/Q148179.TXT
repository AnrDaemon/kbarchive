 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running the ISDN Accelerator Pack for Microsoft Internet Explorer
2.0 with a Digi Datafire or PCIMAC ISDN adapter, the adapter may stop working
while you are connecting to a server, while you are copying files, or within
five minutes of connecting.

CAUSE
=====

Digi ISDN adapters running at 128K do not connect reliably with servers using
other manufacturers' adapters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, change the connection speed from 128K to 64K by
performing the following steps:

1. In My Computer, double-click Dial-Up Networking.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the connection, and then click Properties
   on the menu that appears.

3. Click Configure.

4. In the Speed Preference box, click 64K.
