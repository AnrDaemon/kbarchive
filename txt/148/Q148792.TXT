The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When mail is queued to a postoffice (PO) defined direct via modem, the External
Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) does not dial the modem when the specified regular
interval period expires.

CAUSE
=====

One possible cause is that a large number of postoffices may be defined direct
via modem. The External Mail program will cycle through this list until it finds
mail queued for transfer. Then it checks to see if the Regular Interval variable
has expired. The time required to cycle through the externally-defined
postoffices may be longer than the Regular Interval variable, making it appear
that the regular interval is being ignored.

WORKAROUND
==========

Possible methods to maintain the Regular Interval variable are to reduce the
number of externally-defined postoffices or to increase the Regular Interval
variable time frequency.
