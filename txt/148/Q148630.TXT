PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, versions 3.11, 3.11a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to Ping an address within or beyond your local token ring
subnet using TCP/IP-32 and NetWare IPX/ODI stack in Windows for Workgroups, the
following error message appears:

   Request Timed Out

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, manually change the frame type in the PROTOCOL.INI (or
NET.CFG) file. The following are the required Token Ring frame type syntaxes for
workstations that need PROTOCOL.INI modifications:

 - Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS and Windows:

         FRAME=TOKENRING

 - Windows for Workgroups 3.11:

         FRAME=TOKEN-RING

 - NetWare (modify NET.CFG):

      FRAME=TOKEN-RING and TOKEN-RING_SNAP

Additional query words: 3.11 wfw wfwg
