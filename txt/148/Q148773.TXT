PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document that contains white text from WordPad, the white text
may printed as black rather than white.

CAUSE
=====

WordPad maps the color white to black when you print to a black and white or
color printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the color of the text to a color other than white, or use a program other
than WordPad to print the document. To change the text color in a document in
WordPad, follow these steps:

1. Select the section of text that you want to change.

2. On the Format menu, click Font.

3. Click a color in the Color box, and then click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The universal printer driver (Unidrv.dll) maps all non-white colors to black
when you print to a black and white or color printer, but it does not map the
color white to black. This behavior causes all non-white text to appear as black
text when printed. Because the color white is not mapped to black, white text is
printed normally.

However, WordPad maps the color white to black when you print to a black and
white or color printer. Therefore, white text is converted to black text before
it is sent to Unidrv.dll, which causes the text to appear as black text when
printed. This behavior is not consistent with Microsoft Word for Windows or
Microsoft Excel for Windows.
