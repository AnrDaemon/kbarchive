TITLE   :BUG: Changes to Double-Precision Values in Debugger Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change a single-precision number stored in a REAL*8 variable to a
double-precision number in one of the debugger's watch windows, you will not be
able to change the value again in the same debugging session. Furthermore, a
REAL*8 variable that is initialized with a double-precision number cannot have
its value changed in the debugger.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Build the following sample code in Developer Studio.

   C Compile options needed: /Zi

         real*8 DoubleVal1, DoubleVal2

         DoubleVal1 = 3.40E+38
         DoubleVal2 = 3.40D+40
         end

1. To invoke a debugging session in Developer Studio, click Debug on the Build
   menu, and then click Step Into.

2. In either the watch or quick watch window, type the variable names
   "DoubleVal1" (without the quotation marks) and "DoubleVal2" (without the
   quotation marks).

3. Change DoubleVal1 to a double-precision number by changing the exponent part
   to D+039 and pressing the ENTER key. Attempting to change the value of
   DoubleVal1 again in the current debugging session will not work. Attempting
   to change the value of DoubleVal2 after it has been initialized will fail.
