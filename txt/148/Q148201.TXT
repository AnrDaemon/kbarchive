Local variables flagged by the compiler as unused become unavailable in the
debugger even if they have been initialized with the DATA statement.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new

project, start a debugging session. On the Build menu, click Debug, and then
click Step Into. The variables "A" and "B" are not displayed in the locals
window even though they have been initialized with the integer values of "1" and
"2" respectively.
