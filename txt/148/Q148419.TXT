PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client on DEC Pathworks
network clients, you may get a General Protection Fault (GP fault) from the
process EXCHNG in WINSOCK.DLL.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Win16 Client requires the latest WINSOCK.DLL (version
6.0.58 or higher) from Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC). This specifically
addresses a Microsoft Exchange GPF at Winsock bind().

RESOLUTION
==========

The patch is located on the Internet or Digital Online Services. Search on
PW-DOS PWV51E04 Pathworks 5.1 for MS-DOS and Windows. The zip file contains
WINSOCK.DLL, WINSOCKD.DLL, and a minimal README.TXT.

Contact the Digital Customer Support Center for compatability and further
information.
