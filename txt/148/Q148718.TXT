KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync), the Dispatch program (Dispatch.exe)
may report the following messages on the screen or on the Dispatch.log:

   NSDA-RT Missed its run Window

   NSDA-S Missed its run Window

   NSDA-RR Missed its run Window

CAUSE
=====

These messages are reported when the Dispatch program was unable to run the task
according to the scheduled Dir-Sync times T1, T2, or T3. The Dispatch program
may not have been running or the postoffice may not have been included in the
Dispatch program configuration when the required task was scheduled to run.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ensure the T1, T2 and T3 times are scheduled accordingly. Ensure the Dispatch
program and the computer running Dispatch is working and all postoffices are
defined in the Dispatch configuration either via the Dispatch.ini or the command
line. The postoffice will run in its next scheduled window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In versions 3.2, 3.2a, and 3.5 of Mail for PC Networks, the scheduled run window
for each Dir-Sync time is 8 hours. If this 8 hour window is missed, these errors
are reported to inform the administrators that the postoffice did not
participate at the scheduled times.

The processing times, as well as other information, is held in the Process.glb
file. You can view the Process.glb file by running the Dssched.exe utility.

The following is an example of a Dssched dump of a Process.glb file:
