The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may see the following error on the screen when you run manual Directory
Synchronization (dirsync), just prior to the beginning of Rebuild.exe.

   Bad ID or Password

When dirsync is being performed manually, you must make sure the administrator's
account and password are correctly specified to invoke Import.exe. See the
"Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync)" document for further details on manual
dirsync.

For more information about how to obtain the dirsync document, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q96060 PC DirSync: Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync)

CAUSE
=====

If the administrator account and password are not correct, no error will be
logged in the Dirsync.log, Dsserver.log, or Central.log file. If dirsync is
being run from a batch file, unless you are watching the screen very closely,
you probably will not notice the error just prior to Rebuild.exe running. If you
are not using a batch file, you will see the error on the screen.

In addition, Rebuild.exe will run and properly rebuild the Global Address List.
The only evidence of a problem other than actually seeing the error message will
be a failure of the updates to post.

The above error has also been seen where the administrator's name and password
are incorrect in an X25 login script.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure the administrator's account name and password are correct for the
postoffice against which Import.exe is being run.
