TITLE   :Incomplete "What Can I Say?" List After Moving Mouse Pointer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 msphone1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Phone, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you obtain a list of available voice commands while Listening mode is stopped
by moving the mouse pointer to the corner of the screen that activates Listening
mode and then issuing the "What can I say?" command, the list of available voice
commands that is displayed may be incomplete. This problem can occur when you
move the mouse pointer shortly after issuing the "What can I say?" command.

CAUSE
=====

When you move the mouse pointer away from the corner of the screen that
activates Listening mode, Listening mode is immediately stopped again. If the
list of available voice commands has not yet been completely displayed, the
remainder of the list is not displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do not move the mouse pointer away from the corner
of the screen until the list of available voice commands has been completely
displayed.
