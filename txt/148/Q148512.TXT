======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes two commands (Properties and About) that are new in
Visual SourceSafe 4.0. These commands are available only from the command line.
They provide useful information and can be used as debugging tools.

MORE INFORMATION
================

About Command
-------------

The About command displays information about the version of SourceSafe that you
are currently using. It lists the same information as the About Box in the
Graphical Interface product. Output from the About command looks like this:

   G:\vss40svr\win32>ss about
   Microsoft (R) SourceSafe Version 4.00
   Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp. 1994-1995. All rights reserved.
   Version 4.00 (Build 0822)

The About command uses the switches -H, -I-, -O, -Y, and -?. For more information
about these switches, click "List of Commands and Options" in Appendix A of
Books Online.

Properties Command
------------------

The Properties command displays attributes about a file or a project. It lists
the name of a file, the path to a project, the size, the latest version and
date, and comments. This command gives additional information for files: the
file type, its size in bytes and lines, and the status of the "Store only latest
version" setting.

Use the following syntax to call the Properties command:

   SS PROPERTIES <SSafe Item> [-B] [-F-] [-H] [-O] [-R] [-L] [-N] [-I-]
   [-Y]

Switches are defined as follows:

 - The -H, -O, -I-, -N and -Y options are documented in the "List of Commands
   and Options" in Appendix A of the Visual SourceSafe Books Online.

 - With the -R option, the properties of all the files in the project tree are
   displayed. -R is ignored if a file name or file mask is specified on the
   command line.

 - The -B switch is the same as the FileType switch. "-B" changes the file to
   binary type, whereas "-B-" changes the file to text type.

 - The -L option changes the "store latest version" setting. When you check a
   file in, you have the option of either storing the latest version of the file
   or recording the difference (delta) information. Call the "-L" option to
   store the latest version on check in or "-L-" to store delta information on
   check in.

 - With the -F- option, only the properties of a project are displayed, and none
   of the attributes of a file are displayed. Using the (-B) or (-L) switches
   will not have any effect because the -B, -B-, -L, and -L- options only
   operate when files are displayed.

When the Properties command is passed the -B or -L switches, the property is
first changed, and then the report is displayed with the modified information.

The output from the Properties command for a file looks like this:

   G:\vss40svr\win32>ss properties skel.c

   File: $/cclass/SKEL.C
   Type: Text
   Size: 948 bytes 18 lines
   Store only latest version: No
   Latest:
   Version: 1
   Date: 8/03/95 3:56p
   Comment: Test project

The output from the command line for a project looks like this:

   G:\vss40svr\win32>ss properties $/cclass

   Project: $/CCLASS
   Contains:
   103 Files
   0 Subproject(s)
   Latest:
   Version: 104
   Date: 8/03/95 3:57p
   Comment: Test project
