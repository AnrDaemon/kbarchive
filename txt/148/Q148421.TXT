TITLE   :XCLN: Messages Marked as Read when Moved from Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you drag an unread message, note, or document from the Windows 95 Exchange
client onto either the Microsoft Windows 95 desktop or a folder not in the
Windows 95 Exchange client, the original message becomes read.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

This is necessary in order to properly handle the read receipts. Once the message
leaves the Windows 95 Exchange client (for example, either moved or copied from
the Windows 95 Exchange client to another location), the receipt tracking is
lost.
