TITLE   :Cannot Add Local Account to Local Group With NET LOCALGROUP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the NET LOCALGROUP command to add or delete a local account to or
from a local group on a Windows NT domain controller, the following error
message appears:

   There is no such global user or group: <local account>

The command syntax is as follows:

   net localgroup <local group> <local account> /<ADD or
   DELETE>

CAUSE
=====

When you use the NET LOCALGROUP command, the domain controller looks for
accounts with the USER_NORMAL_ACCOUNT flag. Local accounts on a domain
controller have the USER_TEMP_DUPLICATE_ACCOUNT flag.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use User Manager for Domains to add or delete local
accounts to local groups. Note that the local group and account must exists
prior to using the "net localgroup <local group> <local account>
/<ADD" command or the error above will be encountered. It is not necessary to
delete user accounts from local groups when using using the /delete option

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
