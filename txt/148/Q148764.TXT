TITLE   :SNA Server 2.11 Refresh Does Not Install From Floppy Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server 2.11 Refresh does not install from a floppy disk that contains
the image files from the \I386\Disks directory on the SNA Server 2.11 compact
disc.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs due to the following:

 - The file size of CHK.SUM increases. Therefore, CHK.SUM and the other image
   files exceed the capacity limit of the 1.44 MB floppy disk during the
   installation.

 - Other floppy disks from the disk set exceed the capacity limit of 1.44 MB if
   you also include SNASP1.HLP and SNASP1.RTF.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Use Xcopy to copy the contents of the \I396\Disks directory to a temporary
   directory on the hard disk drive. For example, type the following at the
   MS-DOS Command Prompt:

   "xcopy <Compact Disc>:\I386\Disks\*.* <Drive>:\<Temp Dir>
   /s" (without the quotation marks)

2. Delete SNASP1.HLP and SNASP1.RTF from the temporary directory.

3. Delete CHK.SUM from the \I386\Disks\Disk1 directory.

4. Create a SNASP1.HLP dummy file (file with zero bytes).

5. Create a CHK.SUM dummy file.

6. Run SNADISK.CMD to create new floppy disks.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11 Service
Pack 1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
