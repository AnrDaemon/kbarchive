TITLE   :PC NTMMTA: Dynamic Connections Fail with Dynadmin and Novell
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Multitasking MTA for Windows NT (NT MMTA) as a service, and you
connect to Novell NetWare version 3.x and 4.x postoffices, the Dynadmin table
cannot be used to specify dynamic connections. The DrivesUNC options must be
specified in the External.ini file for the Novell postoffices.

NOTE: The Dynadmin table may be used successfully for dynamically connecting to
Microsoft-compatible postoffices or when you run the NT MMTA as an application
from the command prompt.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following password statements in the External.ini file for each Novell
postoffice that the NT MMTA will be dynamically connecting to when it is run as
a service,

   DrivesUNC=\\server\volume\directory username

In addition, you can remove any DrivesDynamic lines from an External.ini file
instance that is going to be used to run the NT MMTA as a service, or rename the
Server.glb file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the Dynadmin table to connect to both Microsoft-compatible and Novell
postoffices when you run the NT MMTA as an application from the command line
(refer to Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT version 3.5
"Administrator's Guide", Page 215).

If you run the NT MMTA as a service, and you have declared Novell postoffices in
the Dynadmin table, you will see one of the following errors on the screen and
in the session log:

   Dynamically connecting to ...
   Network name not found, or Unknown error code 901:2
   Reading master file. Could not connect to drive.
