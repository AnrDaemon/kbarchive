TITLE   :Remote Shutdown Fails When Logon Screensaver Starts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to remotely shut down Windows NT 3.51 using the
InitiateSystemShutdown API after it starts the Logon screensaver, the remote
shutdown fails. This occurs for both SHUTCMD.EXE and SHUTGUI.EXE from the
Windows NT Resource Kit 3.51.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs if you have not logged on to Windows NT. By default, the Logon
screensaver starts 15 minutes after the computer boots and there is no activity.
This problem does not occur if the Logon screensaver starts through Control
Panel Desktop after someone logs on to Windows NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A fix
to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
