The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you start the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, it will typically use the MS Sans
Serif font. However, if you have configured Windows to use only True Type fonts,
it will use the System font.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Visual SourceSafe Explorer is using the System font, text displayed in
column headers, tool tips, and other visual elements may appear to be bolder and
slightly larger than expected. To configure Windows to use only True Type fonts,
follow one of the following sets of steps depending on your operating system:

Windows 3.x
-----------

1. Open the Fonts icon located in Windows Control Panel, and click the True Type
   button.

2. Select the "Show Only True Type Fonts in Applications" check box and close
   the Fonts dialog box.

Windows 95 and Windows NT
-------------------------

1. Open the Fonts icon located in Windows Control Panel.

2. Choose Options from the View menu, and click the True Type tab. Select the
   "Show only True Type fonts in the programs on my computer" check box, and
   close the Fonts dialog box.
