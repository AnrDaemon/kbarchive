TITLE   :PRB: Changing Partition Formatting Causes Grid to Jump Around
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the View property of a grid, you'll find that the Browse-Change or
Change-Browse works correctly but might not produce the look you want. The
record pointer moves through the table on the browse side. However, as you move
through the records on the browse side of the grid, the change side does not
place the field that is scrolled through at the top of the grid as another
record is selected. The field on the change side appears, but it doesn't appear
in a specific place.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. As the next record is selected, the change side of
the grid is issued a page up or down to get to that record. Depending on the
number of fields that there are in the table, the paging stops when it gets to a
field in that record.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form. Right-click the form, and choose the Data Environment.
   Then right-click again in the Data Environment box, and choose the Add Table
   menu.

2. Add any table to the Data Environment. Then drag the heading of the table to
   the form to place a grid on the form.

3. Change the grid's Partition property to 100. Select Browse - Change from the
   View property of the grid.

4. Run the form. Click the first field on the Browse side, and press the DOWN
   arrow key.

Note that the corresponding field on the change side does not show up at the top
of the grid as the record pointer is moved. The corresponding field is displayed
at different positions in the grid. This is because the fields on the change
side are internally paged through, so the field isn't necessarily placed at the
top each time another record is selected.
