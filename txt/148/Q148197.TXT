TITLE   :XCLN: WinNT Client Can Leave 0 Byte File on W95 or W16 Share
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you are using a Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client and you cancel the
addition of a Personal Folder located on a Windows 95 or Windows 3.x share, a 0
byte file will be left on the share.


STATUS
======

Windows NT 3.51 has a bug in which the GetOpenFileName() call will leave a 0
byte file if the file does not exist and was supposed to be located on a Windows
95 or Windows 3.x share. When the process of creating a PST is completed,
normally Microsoft Exchange will delete the 0 byte file and create the correct
PST file. Canceling this process before completion leaves the 0 byte file
intact. This problem will not occur in a Microsoft Exchange Service Pack 2
Windows NT client running on Windows NT version 4.0.
