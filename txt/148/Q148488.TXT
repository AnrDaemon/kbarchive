SUMMARY
=======

The default dictionary for the International version of the Microsoft Exchange
client is the American English dictionary, not the British dictionary.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can change the spelling dictionary language by modifying the following
registry entry:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Options
   \DictionaryLangID

The setting for US English is 1033, and the setting for UK English is 2057.

A registry setting can be changed in the Exchange.stf file before the user
installs the Microsoft Exchange client or afterwards by manually editing the
registry.

If this registry entry is set, Microsoft Exchange will use the Language ID in the
registry entry. If the registry entry is not set, spelling will function with
the American English dictionary. Setup will not create this registry entry.

This information is also available in the release notes.
