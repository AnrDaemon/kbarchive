SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to upgrade an earlier version of Windows to Windows 95 on a
drive with ample free space, you may receive the following error message while
Setup is performing a routine check of your computer:

   Low Disk Space

   There is not enough disk space to upgrade your current version of Windows.
   However, Setup did find space for the following: a typical installation of
   Windows on a different drive. If you set up Windows on different drive, you
   will have to reinstall all of your existing Windows programs. Click OK to
   continue Setup and install the following: a typical installation of Windows
   on a different drive. Click Cancel to quit Setup, in which case you should
   free up more disk space on the drive that contains your existing version of
   Windows. Then run Setup again.

CAUSE
=====

The PATH statement does not contain drive letters. For example:

   SET PATH = \windows;\dos;

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Modify the PATH statement in the Autoexec.bat file to contain drive letters.
   For example, change the statement

   SET PATH = \windows;\dos;

   to:

   SET PATH = c:\windows;c:\dos;

 - Disable the PATH statement in the Autoexec.bat file. To do so, place the word
   "rem" (without the quotation marks) at the beginning of the PATH statement.
   For example:

   REM SET PATH = \windows;\dos;
