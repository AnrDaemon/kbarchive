KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Program Maintenance Utility (NMAKE), used with:
    - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to create a project file by using the NMAKE utility with a source
file name containing certain special characters such as $, !, or #, one of the
following errors occurs depending upon the character used:

Source filename: hi$there.f90

   NMAKE : fatal error U1073: don't know how to make '".\hihere.f90"'

Source filename: hi!there.f90

   NMAKE : fatal error U1017: unknown directive '!there.obj"'

Source filename: hi#there.f90

   NMAKE : fatal error U1038: internal error : lexer

CAUSE
=====

NMAKE treats certain special characters as command-line arguments or macros, or
it is unable to process them at all.

RESOLUTION
==========

Avoid using special characters in source file names or use Developer Studio to
create and manage your projects.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
