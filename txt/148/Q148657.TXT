TITLE   :Err Msg: "The network name was deleted" w/ DIR in Batch File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the command NET SHARE in a batch file to delete an existing share
and recreate the same share under a different name, and then use the DIR command
in one of the directories on that share, the following error message pop-up
dialog box appears prompting you to choose OK before the batch file can
continue:

   CMD.EXE-System error
   The network name was deleted
   OK

Here is a batch file example:

Assume there is a directory A shared under the name B on the local computer where
the batch file is running:

   NET SHARE B=d:\A
   DIR \\<server name>\B\<directory_name>
   NET SHARE B /d

This batch file runs fine the first time, but generates the error message above
when you run it the second time.

In the Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) window the following error message appears:

   The name specified is no longer available.


CAUSE
=====

CMD.EXE caches the file handle for the old network share and fails to update it
when the share is recreated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
