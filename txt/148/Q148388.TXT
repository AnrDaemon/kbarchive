SUMMARY
=======

When a CPropertyPage is activated, the first control in the page's tab order
will get the focus by default. To change the default to a different control,
derive a class from CPropertyPage, override OnSetActive(), and post a user
message to a member function that will actually set the focus to the desired
control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CPropertySheet's member function OnSetActive() is called when a PSN_SETACTIVE
message is sent to that page. Attempting to set the focus to a control while in
this handler won't produce the expected results because after this notification
is handled, the tab control will get the focus.

Therefore, you need to post a message to the property sheet's message queue with
a user message in order to set the focus to the desired control once the page is
active.

Sample Code
-----------

   // this is the user-defined message
   #define WM_SETPAGEFOCUS WM_APP+2
   BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP(CMyPage, CPropertyPage)
     ON_MESSAGE(WM_SETPAGEFOCUS, OnSetPageFocus)
   END_MESSAGE_MAP()

   BOOL CMyPage::OnSetActive()
   {
     BOOL fRet = CPropertyPage::OnSetActive();

     PostMessage(WM_SETPAGEFOCUS, 0, 0L);

     return fRet;
   }

   LONG CMyPage::OnSetPageFocus(UINT wParam, LONG lParam)
   {
     // IDC_BUTTON2 is the button on this property page
     // that you want to give the default focus.

     CButton* pBtn = (CButton*)GetDlgItem(IDC_BUTTON2);
     ASSERT(pBtn);
     pBtn->SetFocus();
     return 0;
   }
