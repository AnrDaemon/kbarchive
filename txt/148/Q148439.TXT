TITLE   :IBM 4019 Prints Very Slowly Under Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Printing to an IBM 4019 printer in native mode using the IBM 4019 printer driver
takes a very long time, compared to the same printer in HP emulation mode using
the HP Laserjet driver or when using the IBM 4019 printer driver under Windows
95.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the printer to HP emulation mode and use the HP Laserjet printer driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In native mode, the IBM 4019 printer uses a PPDSL standard. In that mode,
Microsoft's printer driver does not support downloading True Type fonts, so they
are printed as graphics.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
