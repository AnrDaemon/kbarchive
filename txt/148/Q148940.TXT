TITLE   :Admin "Select Domain" SNA Server in Subdomain Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the SNA Server Administrator tool is used to open a configuration of a server
that is in the same Microsoft Windows NT domain, but on a different SNA
subdomain, the SNA Server Administrator tool will incorrectly show the current
local configuration; however, it will show the requested domain in the lower
right hand side status bar entry (Domain: XXXXXX).

This problem does not occur if the remote SNA Server is in a different Windows NT
domain.

CAUSE
=====

This problem was inadvertently introduced in SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 when
the Distributed Link Service support was added to the product.


WORKAROUND
==========

An update to SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 is available to correct this
problem.

Without applying this update, a workaround exists if you are connecting to the
remote server over a LAN interface other than TCP/IP sockets:

Use the following syntax when you use SNA Server Admin to administer a server in
the same Windows NT domain, but a different SNA subdomain:

   SNAADMIN /NET:<subdomain name>

where <subdomain name> is the name of the subdomain you wish to
administer.

NOTE: The above workaround will not work when you use TCP/IP sockets to connect
to the remote SNA Server machine (for example, there is no subdomain ->
server IP address name resolution mechanism available when using TCP/IP
sockets).

For additional information on the /NET switch for SNAADMIN, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11 with
Service Pack 1 installed. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA
Server 2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack,
