TITLE   :FIX: Distribution Disk Setup Fails with Setup Error 279
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After creating an .exe in Visual FoxPro and using the Setup Wizard to create a
set of distribution disk images, you run Setup from the disk images and Setup
fails with the following error:

   Setup Error 279 Object 240 Your Setup files may be damaged. Try restarting
   the Setup program.

When you click OK (your only option), Setup informs you that the application was
not set up successfully and the Setup routine ends.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup Wizard asks you for the platform on which you will be installing your
application. If you select Windows 95 and the file name of your .exe file
violates the 8.3 file-naming convention, this problem occurs when you run setup
from the resulting disk images.


RESOLUTION
==========

The only available workaround is to ensure that your .exe file name conforms to
the 8.3 naming convention.

Or you can install the updated Setup Wizard files. For a description of these
files, and how to obtain them, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q103323 PATCH: Setupwiz.exe Updated VFP for Windows 3.0b Setup Wizard

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed with the updated
Setup Wizard files in Setupwiz.exe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not exist in the Visual FoxPro 3.0 Setup Wizard. Nor does it
affect setup disks created for either Windows 3.x or Windows NT using either of
the setup wizards included with Visual FoxPro 3.0 or 3.0b.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create an .exe file in Visual FoxPro, and save the file with a name that
   violates the 8.3 file-naming convention. For example, name it
   MyLongFileName.exe.

2. Use the Visual FoxPro 3.0b Setup Wizard to create setup disks for your .exe
   file.

3. In the Setup Wizard, choose Windows 95 for your installation platform.

4. After the Setup Wizard finishes, run setup from the disk images you just
   created. At this point the error occurs.
