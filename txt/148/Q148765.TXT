SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the availability of the Microsoft 32-bit Data Link
Control (DLC) update to Microsoft's 32-bit Data Link Control (MSDLC32) protocol.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DLC Update
----------

Update your existing Microsoft 32-bit Data Link Control (MSDLC32) protocol for
Windows 95 with the DLC update if you have encountered the following problem:

   Your current 32-bit DLC protocol stack may hang under Windows 95 if a 32-bit
   program tries to open the network adapter more than once to connect to two
   different IBM host computers, or if multiple 32-bit programs try to open the
   network adapter at the same time to connect to different host computers. For
   example, the problem can occur if a terminal emulation program opens the
   adapter twice to connect to two different AS/400 hosts, and opens a display
   session to each host. This problem happens rarely on Ethernet networks, but
   may occur often on token ring networks due to the higher number of status
   indication messages.

NOTE: You must first install the Microsoft 32-bit Data Link Control (MSDLC32)
protocol for Windows 95 (Msdlc32.exe) before you install the DLC update
(Dlc32upd.exe). For information about the MSDLC32 protocol, please see the
