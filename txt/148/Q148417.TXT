SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up a FrontPage form to submit form results as
an e-mail attachment rather than saving the results in a file. Note that some
browsers may not support the mailto Uniform Resource Locator (URL).

NOTES:

 - Microsoft Internet Explorer, versions 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 do not support the
   inclusion of form output to a mailto URL.
 - Posting results by e-mail works only if the client has a Post Office Protocol
   3 (POP3) compliant e-mail system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up a form to submit results as an e-mail attachment, follow these steps:

1. In FrontPage Editor, create a form.

2. Right-click any object in the form, and then click Properties on the menu
   that appears.

   The form will be outlined by a dashed box.

3. Click Form.

4. From the Form Handler list, click Custom CGI Script and then click Settings.

5. In the Action box, type the following, replacing everything after "mailto:"
   with the actual e-mail address you want to use:

      mailto:example@microsoft.com

6. In the Method box, type or select Post, and then click OK.

7. Click OK twice.

When your form is submitted, your e-mail program starts and opens a New Message
window. The form will be sent as a text attachment if the sender's e-mail system
and Web browser support this type of action. If the sender's Web browser does
not support the mailto URL, the sender can insert the text and manually send the
message.
