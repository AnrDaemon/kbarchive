TITLE   :Updated OS/2 Client DLL Files Not Included in Service Pack 1
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 OS/2 client includes the following updated
library files (instead of the updated OS/2 client DLL files):

   acsrui.lib
   acssli.lib
   appc.lib
   cpic.lib

These library files are the same files as the ones in the SNA Server 2.11 SDK.

The 211SP102.EXE file contains the updated OS/2 client DLL files (ACSRUI.DLL,
ACSSLI.DLL, APPC.DLL, and CPIC.DLL). You can find this self- extracting file on
the following service:

 - Internet (anonymous FTP)
   ftp ftp.microsoft.com
   Change to the Bussys/winnt/sna-public/fixes/sna211/ussp1 /client folder.
   Get 211SP102.EXE

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11 Service
Pack 1 for NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These updated modules correct general API issues that are found on platforms
such as 16-bit and 32-bit Windows clients. The API code is supported by common
source modules for all client platforms. Therefore, the fixes to RUI, SLI, APPC
and CPIC have also been implemented for the OS/2 client. For a description of
LUA, APPC, and CPIC interface fixes, run SNASP1.HLP (included in SNA Service
2.11 Service Pack 1).
