TITLE   :Use of the "Seconds" Field for BOOTP Relay Agents

SUMMARY
=======

Some BOOTP Relay Agents implement the use of the Seconds field in a Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Discover or BOOTP BOOTREQUEST packet as defined in
RFC 1542. This option will limit the clients Discover broadcast to the local
subnet until the seconds threshold is reached. This option can reduce network
traffic and increase the chance that a local server will service the request.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Relay Agent will only forward the packet if the Seconds field is higher than
the threshold set. RFC recommends the default to be 4 seconds. The seconds field
is defined as the number of seconds from the first packet sent. For example, the
first packet sent will have a value of 0. The next packet sent would have a
value of 10, if it was sent 10 seconds after the first packet.

This feature is supported in the Windows NT BOOTP Relay Agent.

RFC 1542 does not require BOOTP Relay Agents to support the Seconds field.
