 - Microsoft Fury 3 for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Fury 3 aircraft moves in a different direction than intended. This occurs
with a Blue Lightning motherboard.

For example, when you press the RIGHT ARROW keyboard key the ship should fly
right. However, the ship may veer left or up. When you move the joystick to the
right, the ship may veer left or down.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Fury 3 version 1.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IBM Blue Lightning Motherboard is actually a 386 chip upgraded to a Fury 3
setup does not detect the chip as a 386 during setup and allows the program to
install and start. Fury 3 does not recognize the Blue Lightning Motherboard 486
chip as a true 486 and will not work properly.
