-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Srcsafe.ini file is the SourceSafe initialization file, and it must be
present for SourceSafe to operate. The Srcsafe.ini file in the Server
installation directory serves as a default for all users. The administrator can
modify this file to change the behavior of SourceSafe. This article lists the
default settings present in the Srcsafe.ini file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default contents of the Server's Srcsafe.ini are as follows:

      ; srcsafe.ini
      ;
      ; Three of these variables -- Data_Path, Users_Path, and Users_Txt --
      ; must be in Srcsafe.ini. Any other variable here can be overridden in
      ; Ss.ini.
      ; Similarly, any Ss.ini variable can be placed in Srcsafe.ini to set a
      ; system "default," which individual users can still override in Ss.ini.

      ; The two important paths used by SourceSafe.
      Data_Path = data
      Temp_Path = temp

      ; This tells admin where to put personal directories for new users.
      Users_Path = users

      ; From this, find users.txt; from that, in turn, find ss.ini for a user.
      Users_Txt = users.txt

      ; The following line contains common file groupings.
      File_Types = Visual Basic (*.bas;*.cls;*.frm;*.frx;*.res;*.vbp;*.mak),
   Visual C++ (*.cpp;*.c;*.hpp;*.h;*.rc;*.mak), Visual FoxPro
   (*.pjt;*.pjx;*.frx;*.frt;*.scx;*.sct;*.vcx;*.vct;*.lbx;*.lbt;*.qpr;*.mnx;*.
   mnt), MS Test (*.mst;*.inc)

The Visual SourceSafe 5.0 Srcsafe.ini contains the additional entries:

      Img_File = HTMLFILE.GIF
      Img_Folder = FOLDER.GIF

These set the glyphs used in displaying Folders and Web Projects.
