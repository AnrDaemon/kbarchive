TITLE   :PRB: A2108 Error When Using Simplified Segment Directives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.0,6.1,6.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.1, 6.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When assembling code that uses simplified segment directives, the Macro
Assembler displays an error message similar to this one:

   error A2108: use of register assumed to ERROR

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur because of incorrect order of the .DATA and .CODE
directives in the assembly source code. The .DATA directive implies ASSUME
CS:ERROR. Any code that appears after the .DATA directive and attempts to
implicitly or explicitly use the CS register (such as JMP instructions or
labels) will generate this error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that a .CODE directive and not a .DATA directive precedes your
procedure definitions and any other instructions.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
