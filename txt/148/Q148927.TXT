KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you download an Internet Update file on a computer system running
Microsoft Windows version 3.x, and double-click the Bs96ingn.z96 update file,
Bookshelf runs without updating the Internet Directory.

The Bs96ingn.z96 update file is not deleted from your system.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Internet Updates file Bs96ingn.z96 must reside on the same drive where
Bookshelf is installed. Before you try to double-click the update file, make
sure you copy, or download, the file to the hard drive where you installed
Bookshelf.

For example, if Bookshelf is installed on the C:\ drive, the Bs96ingn.z96 file
must be copied to C:\ before you can perform a successful integration. After the
integration occurs the Bs96ingn.z96 Update file is deleted from the computer.
