TITLE   :NWCONV.EXE Does Not Give Correct Permissions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use NWCONV.EXE to convert a Netware data a security to a Windows NT
server with you may find the subdirectories do not have the correct security
applied.

For example, on a Netware server that has a volume root of "SYS" and several
subdirectories:

   SYS
    \APPS
      \TEST
         \A
         \B
         \C
         \D

Where normal default perms reside on volume:

   APPS  has a Group trustee with (R    F)
   TEST  has a Group trustee with (RWCEMF)
   A..D  through inheritance on TEST would also have(RWCEMF)

After you run NWCONV.EXE, Windows NT has the following permissions:

   APPS  has Group with RX  RX
   TEST  has Group with RWXD RX
   A..D  has group with RX RX

The problem is that A..D have RX RX (not RWXD RWXD, which is what the permissions
should be based on the Netware security prior to the NWCONV.EXE utility being
run).

WORKAROUND
==========

This issue can be worked around in two fashions:

1. Remove any trustee assignments that restrict group assignments at the root.

   -or-

2. In file Manager, Security, on the Windows NT server, reset the file security
   that you require.
