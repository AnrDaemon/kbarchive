   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks, a file on a Microsoft
networking server (such as a Microsoft Windows NT, Windows 95, Microsoft Windows
for Workgroups, or Microsoft LAN Manager server) may become damaged or may
contain invalid data if multiple workstations access the file at the same time.

CAUSE
=====

The network redirector (Vredir.vxd) caches data locally for files it accesses on
a Microsoft networking server. If the file size does not change or if the last
modified time does not change within a two-second period, the redirector reads
file data from the locally stored cache rather than from the file on the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95:

   VREDIR.VXD version 4.00.1112 (dated 2/11/97) and later

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

   Download Vredrupd.exe now
   (http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95upg/vredir/1/W95/EN-US/vredrupd.exe)

   Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. After it is posted, the file is housed on
secure servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


This update resolves this issue by disabling caching on all FileOpen calls only
if the following binary value is present in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\VREDIR
   Value Name: DiscardCacheOnOpen
   Value: 01 00 00 00

If this value is not present or is set to 0, this update behaves the same as
Vredir.vxd versions 4.00.955 and earlier.

This value is not added by default and must be added manually in order to disable
caching when opening files.

STATUS
======

This issue is resolved in Microsoft Windows 98.
