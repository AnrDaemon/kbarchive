-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange client to read a mail message, you may see a
thin black line underneath the From: field in the message header.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The black line is always present underneath the From: header
in messages; however, it will be more or less pronounced depending on the color
scheme you are using and the Readbar color you select.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you do not want to see a black line, you can adjust the Readbar color so that
the black line no longer appears to be present:

1. On the Tools menu, Click Options.

2. Select the Colors tab.

3. In the Message section, select a different color for the Readbar.

4. Click Apply or OK to use the new color.
