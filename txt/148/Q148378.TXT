KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbtool

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up Remote Access Service (RAS) in Windows NT Server on computers
with large numbers of modems attached, the Setup process may take an extended
amount of time to add all attached modems and complete the setup process.

CAUSE
=====

This slow down occurs when using the modem installer during the RAS setup
procedure, and was caused by the method used by setup to enumerate each modem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
