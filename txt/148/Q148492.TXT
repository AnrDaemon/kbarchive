SUMMARY
=======

The SCSI ID configuration for Future Domain SCSI controllers is the reverse of
the industry standard. The reversal of the SCSI ID is for performance and/or
priority reasons on the SCSI BUS.

The Future Domain SCSI adapters use the highest SCSI ID for the boot drive, this
is normally ID 6. When adding new SCSI device it will be important to configure
the device with a lower SCSI ID then the current boot device.

The following information from the Future Domain Installation Instructions
discusses the reasoning behind the reverse ID scheme:

   Devices with higher SCSI IDs receive priority from your computer over devices
   with lower IDs. The controller uses SCSI ID 7, so it is given the highest
   priority by your computer. You may assign higher IDs to your most often used
   and fastest devices.

   For example, our main SCSI hard drive should be assigned SCSI ID 6 so that it
   will receive priority over other SCSI devices.

   Note: If you have more than one SCSI hard drive, the drive with the highest ID
   will always be the boot drive.
