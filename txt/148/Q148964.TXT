TITLE   :Windows 95 Running Server Tools Sets Incorrect Permissions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 95 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Server Tools on a Windows 95 client and you create a new user for
the domain with a home directory on an NT file system (NTFS) volume, the default
permissions are incorrect. The default permissions are "EVERYONE FULL CONTROL."
The permissions should be "<username> FULL CONTROL," where the user name
is the name of the user that was created.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the permissions manually to "<username> FULL CONTROL," or create
the user account from a Windows NT Server or Workstation running Server Tools.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server versions 3.5,
3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.
