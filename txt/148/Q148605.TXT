TITLE   :BUG: Compiler Syntax Error If Edit Descriptors Contain Spaces
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling a free form source file having multiple-character edit descriptors
with embedded spaces in a FORMAT statement results in this error:

   FOR3852: syntax error detected

CAUSE
=====

The compiler treats files having the extension .f90 as free form source files.
In a free form source file, spaces are normally significant except in FORMAT
statements.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do one of the following:

 - Remove the spaces within the multiple-character edit descriptors.

-or-

 - Use a fixed form source file by changing the extension to .for.

-or-

 - Disable free form source using the /4Nf compiler switch.

-or-

 - Use the !MS$NOFREEFORM metacommand before the FORMAT statements containing
   the multiple-character edit descriptors with spaces.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Sample Code to Illustrate and Work Around Problem
-------------------------------------------------

   ! Use Fortran 90 source extension: .F90

   ! Workaround #3, use the /4Nf compiler switch

   ! !MS$NOFREEFORM ! Workaround #4, uncomment this metacommand

         integer :: i = 123
         write(*, 100) i, i, i
   100   format(1x, i5, sp, i5, ss, i5)   ! This compiles
         write(*, 200) i, i, i
   200   format(1x, i5, s p, i5, s s, i5) ! This doesn't compile
         end
