SUMMARY
=======

This article describes Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1 is version 950a of Windows 95, provided to
original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for preinstallation on computers meant
to be sold in the retail channel or to corporate customers. This is not a new
version of Windows 95. OEM Service Release 1 is Windows 95 with Microsoft
Internet Explorer 2.0 and the fixes and components included with Microsoft
Windows 95 Service Pack 1 included. The updated and additional tools provided
with Windows 95 Service Pack 1 are not included in OEM Service Release 1.

If you are able to determine that some of the fixes and components included with
Windows 95 Service Pack 1 are installed on a computer, but you are not sure
whether they were installed by Windows 95 Service Pack 1 or OEM Service Release
1, double-click Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel. If Windows 95 Service Pack
1 appears in the list of installed programs, then the fixes and components were
most likely installed by Windows 95 Service Pack 1. If Windows 95 Service Pack 1
does not appear in the list of installed programs, then they were most likely
installed by OEM Service Release 1.

NOTE: You can install Windows 95 Service Pack 1 over OEM Service Release 1. If
you do so, the fixes and components are most recently installed by Windows 95
Service Pack 1, but you are also running OEM Service Release 1. In addition,
note that the Tweak UI component of the Windows 95 Power Toys can be used to
remove Windows 95 Service Pack 1 from the list of installed programs that
appears when you double-click Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel. If you do
so, Windows 95 Service Pack 1 does not appear in the list of installed programs
even though the fixes and components were installed by Windows 95 Service Pack
1.

OEM Service Release 1 is not available for download or purchase from Microsoft by
retail customers. All the functionality provided with OEM Service Release 1 can
be obtained by installing Windows 95 Service Pack 1. For information about
Windows 95 Service Pack 1, please see the following article in the Microsoft
