TITLE   :BUG: Breakpoint Occurs When You Insert Clipboard Assistant
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the Clipboard Assistant on the Checked build of Windows NT,
the following message appears as you move between the pages of the Clipboard
Assistant component:

   A breakpoint has been reached.
   (0x80000003) occured in the application at location 0x77f728d0.

   Click OK to terminate the application.
   Click Cancel to debug the application.

NOTE: The Checked build of Windows NT is Windows NT with system debug versions of
the system DLLs.

RESOLUTION
==========

If Developer Studio is installed as the system debugger (The just-in-time
debugging feature), you can click Cancel to debug the application. Then another
instance of Developer Studio will be launched to debug the problem. At that
point, you can just click Go on the Debug menu to continue execution. The
breakpoint can be ignored.

To install Developer Studio as your just-in-time debugger, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the Debug tab.

2. Select the Just-in-Time Debugging check box.

3. Click OK.

NOTE: You must have administrator privileges to set the Just-in-Time option.

STATUS
======

beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
