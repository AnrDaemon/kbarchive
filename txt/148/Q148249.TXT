TITLE   :DOC: Help File Example for SELECT SQL UNION Does Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

KEYWORDS:kbdocfix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro's Help information for SELECT - SQL gives an incorrect example of
how to use the UNION clause. It will return the following error if you try to
run it:

   SELECTs are not UNION compatible

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The placeholders for orders.order_id and orders.emp_id in the second SELECT are
for the wrong data type. The placeholders are for numeric fields and they should
be for character fields. The example should read as follows:

      SELECT customer.company, orders.order_id, orders.emp_id ;
         FROM customer, orders ;
         WHERE customer.cust_id = orders.cust_id ;
      UNION ;
         SELECT customer.company, '', '' ;
         FROM customer ;
         WHERE customer.cust_id NOT IN ;
         (SELECT orders.cust_id FROM orders)
