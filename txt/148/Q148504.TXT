KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbVC kbVC500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), used with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When encountering a cast to a structure pointer in the default argument of a
class member function, the Visual C++ compiler generates the following error:

   error C2371: 'MyClass' : redefinition; different basic types

This error does not occur if the function declaration is not a member of a class.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are casting from an integral literal, remove the cast. For example,
change this:

      MyFunc (struct MyStruct *p = (struct MyStruct*)0);  //C2371 error

to this:

      MyFunc (struct MyStruct *p = 0);                    //no error

If you are casting from a different structure type, remove the struct keyword
from the cast. For example, change this:

      yFunc (struct MyStruct *p = (struct MyStruct*)x);  //C2371 error

to this:

      MyFunc (struct MyStruct *p = (MyStruct*)x);         //no error

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.
