TITLE   :XADM: Exchange Server Setup Halts Copying MAPI32.DLL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup exc4 exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program may pause with a dialog box stating
the following:

   STOP Setup cannot copy <cd>:\SETUP\<platform>\MAPI32.DLL: The
   file cannot be overwritten because it is in use by another process.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program tries to install Mapi32.dll to the
<winnt>\System32 directory during installation. It is possible that some
mail-aware application or Microsoft Windows NT service is running that has
already loaded this DLL file; therefore, the file is in use and cannot be
overwritten.

RESOLUTION
==========

Close all running applications except for the Setup program. Stop all services
that are mail-aware (capable of sending e-mail) such as anti-virus software,
Compaq Insights Agents, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and so on.
Click Retry.

If this does not allow the Setup program to continue, or if the application or
service cannot be determined at this time, click Ignore. The Setup program
should finish.

At this point, the application or service using Mapi32.dll must be determined and
temporarily halted so that <cd>\Setup\<platform>\Mapi32.dll can be
manually copied to the <winnt>\System32 directory.

You need to be aware of some less obvious MAPI-aware applications, specifically,
some uninterruptible power supplies, include monitoring software that runs as a
Windows NT service. This software may be mail-aware and configured to send
e-mail to a system administrator under specific monitored conditions.

STATUS
======

In Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0, this behavior is by design and will
not be changed.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0. This has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
