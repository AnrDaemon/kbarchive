SUMMARY
=======

After performing an Administrative Setup to a network directory, you can perform
a batch mode installation (SETUP /Q) that does a minimum install rather than a
complete install. The steps below describe how to do this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An Administrative Setup creates a network directory structure containing the
files suitable for installing Visual FoxPro to network clients. You can automate
the client installation by running Setup.exe in a batch mode. This is
accomplished by connecting to the network directory containing the
Administrative Setup files and running Setup.exe with the /Q command line
parameter. By default, this will perform a complete install. To perform a
minimum install instead, you need to modify the following three files in the
Administrative Setup directory:

   Foxset16.stf
   Foxset32.stf
   Foxset95.stf

You can edit these files with most text editors. However, the MS-DOS Editor
(Edit.com) should not be used because it changes tabs to spaces.

Below are the two lines that need to be changed. The change involves changing the
second column in the indicated line to Yes or No, as needed. Note that
<tab> indicates where the tab characters should be in each line.

1. Change the second column in the following line from Yes to No.

   Change this line:

      13<tab>Yes<tab>&Complete<tab>Install all files for Microsoft Visual
      FoxPro<tab>Group<tab>26 28 29 30 31 32 33<tab>"foxsetup.dll,
      103"<tab><tab><tab><tab>

   to this line:

      13<tab>No<tab>&Complete<tab>Install all files for Microsoft Visual
      FoxPro<tab>Group<tab>26 28 29 30 31 32 33<tab>"foxsetup.dll,
      103"<tab><tab><tab><tab>

2. Change the second column in the following line from No to Yes.

   Change this line:

      15<tab>No<tab>&Laptop (Minimum)<tab>Install just the minimum set of
      files needed to run Microsoft Visual FoxPro.<tab>Group<tab>26<tab>
      "foxsetup.dll, 105"<tab><tab><tab><tab>

   to this line:

      15<tab>Yes<tab>&Laptop (Minimum)<tab>Install just the minimum set of
      files needed to run Microsoft Visual FoxPro.<tab>Group<tab>26<tab>
      "foxsetup.dll, 105"<tab><tab><tab><tab>
