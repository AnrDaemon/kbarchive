SUMMARY
=======

If a user on a Windows NT Workstation 3.51 has write privileges on a Windows NT
Server 3.51, the user can compress or uncompress NTFS files on the server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NTFS compression is a write operation. Anyone with write privileges can compress
and uncompress files on the shared NTFS partition. If you are concerned about
users compressing and uncompressing large number of files and directories on the
NTFS partition, use the Windows NT security model to restrict user access. For
example, you may want to give a user write privileges to his or her own
directory on a large server, and restrict write privileges on the root directory
or other users' files.
