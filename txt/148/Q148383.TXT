TITLE   :BUG: INTENT(OUT) Allows Subroutine to Use Undefined Argument
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An illegal use of a dummy variable specified by the INTENT(OUT) statement does
not cause an appropriate compile-time error or warning message to be generated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The INTENT(OUT) dummy argument must be defined by the subroutine before it is
used. When the subroutine is started, the dummy argument is undefined, so any
executable statement associated with it prior to its definition should cause a
compilation error or warning.

Sample Code to Illustrate Problem
---------------------------------

   C Compile options needed: none

         real z
         z = 32
         call sub(z)
         print *, z
         end

         subroutine sub(x)
         real, intent(out) :: x
         print *, x   ! x undefined; No compiler warning or error generated
         X = 5
         end subroutine
