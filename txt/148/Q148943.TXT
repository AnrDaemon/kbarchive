-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Setup/uninstall from the Banyan VINES Client for NT distribution
media, the VINES Workstation Service and the VINES program group are
successfully removed. However, the VINES IP Protocol is not removed. Although
the bindings for VINES IP are removed, the VINES IP Protocol is still displayed
in Installed Network Software under Control Panel Network.

CAUSE
=====

The Banyan Setup/uninstall utility does not remove the following key, nor its
subkeys, from the registry:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Banyan


WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this problem with the following steps:

1. Run Setup/uninstall from the VINES Client for NT distribution media.

2. Restart the server.

3. Open Control Panel Network and push the Close button. (This button is not
   normally available when you first open Network; it will be available after
   the first two steps have been taken).

4. Delete the following key from the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Banyan

5. Restart the server.
