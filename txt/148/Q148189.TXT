TITLE   :Free/Busy Time Planner Doesn't Translate Time Zones
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Free and Busy time is not translated to or from other time zones, which makes it
difficult to schedule appointments across time zones. Data is always assumed to
be in the local time zone. The expected behavior would be to show appointments
in the originator's time zone values no matter what time zone the invitees are
in. However, this is not what happens.

RESOLUTION
==========

Once an appointment is scheduled, the time zones are managed properly. To find a
free time for your invitee, you must make a mental time conversion, but once you
find a free time that works, the actual appointment can be scheduled in your
time and will show up correctly on your invitee's calendar in their time.

For example, say User1 is located in the Pacific time zone using the Windows 95
Exchange client and User2 is located in Eastern time zone using the Windows 95
Exchange client. If User1 creates an appointment for 12:00 - 15:00 PST and
invites User2 by using the Planner, User1 sees the appointment in Pacific time
and User2 sees same appointment in Eastern time. If User2 creates appointment
for 11:00 - 14:00 EST and invites User1 by using the Planner, User2 sees the
appointment correctly in Pacific time and User1 sees the appointment correctly
in Eastern time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
