TITLE   :FIX: Class Designer Changes the Width of a Form Class
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro, Microsoft recommends that forms and classes be designed using
the Foxels measurement instead of the Pixels measurement when an application is
intended to be used across platforms or when the font metrics are likely to
change (small to large, for example).

However, if a Form class is created using the Class Designer with the scalemode
set to Foxel and width set to a specific number, the width of the form may be
reduced or enlarged depending on the font used. For example, it is reduced by
twenty five percent (25%) after the class has been changed to Courier New from
Arial, saved, and modified again. This is demonstrated in the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q129208 Pixel Replaces Foxel as Default Scale Value in Design Mode

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevents this from happening, change the Scalemode property to Pixels or
don't change the Fontname property from Arial.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Using the Visual FoxPro class designer, create a new class based on Form.

2. Set the properties of the form as follows:

      FontName = "Courier New"
      ScaleMode = "Foxels"
      Width = 100

3. Save the class in a class Library.

4. Modify the class.

Note that the width is now 75 instead of the initial setting of 100. Each
subsequent save or modification results in 25% reduction in the width.
