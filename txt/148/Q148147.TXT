-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Cinemania for Windows 1996 edition 
 - Microsoft Music Central for Windows 1996 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you download an update for Cinemania 1996 or Music Central 1996, and then
rename the update file conforming to one of the following file standards, no
file integration occurs:

   <month>.cin96upd

   -or-

   <month>.msc96upd

Where <month> is the month of the update you are trying to integrate.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Windows 95 is configured to hide MS-DOS file extensions for file type
that are registered.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change your Windows 95 settings to display file extensions. To do this, follow
these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows Explorer.

2. On the View menu, click Options.

3. Click the View tab.

4. Click the "Hide MS-DOS File Extensions For File Types That Are Registered"
   check box to clear it.

5. Click OK.

6. The update file should look like the following:

   WinNov95.Cin96upd.cin

7. Rename the file extension to the following:

   <file name>.cin96upd

   Where <file name> is the name of the update file. For example, rename
   the following file,

   WinNov95.Cin96upd.cin

   to:

   WinNov95.cin96upd

   For more information about renaming files, see your Windows printed
   documentation or online Help.

8. Restart Cinemania 96 or Music Central 96.

   The update file automatically integrates with Cinemania 96 or Music Central
   96.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an 8.3-compliant file is downloaded, expanded and renamed, the file
contains an additional extension.
