SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a switchboard item to close a run-time application installed with
the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools or the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit for Windows 95, a user may receive the following error
message when the user clicks the button:

   Execution of this application has stopped due to a run-time error. The
   application cannot continue and will be shut down.

Although the desired result is to quit the program, the message box can be very
distracting to the user.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two workarounds to prevent the user from receiving this error
message.

Workaround 1

1. Create the following new macro:

   Macro Name  Macro Action

         QuitMacro   Quit

2. Add the following command button to the switchboard form:

   Command button:
            Name: Button0
            Caption: Quit Application
            OnClick: QuitMacro

Workaround 2
------------

1. Add the following command button to the switchboard form:

   Command button:
            Name: Button0
            Caption: Quit Application
            OnClick: [Event Procedure]
