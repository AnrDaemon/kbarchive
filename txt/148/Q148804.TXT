PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork win95 kbRPC kbSDKPlatform kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you run a program that uses RPC
(remote procedure calls):

   An exception 0E has occurred in Rpcss.exe...

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 RPC endpoint mapper service, Rpcss.exe, may not correctly handle
reentrancy (more than one pending request). If the RPC endpoint mapper is
concurrently accessed by two processes, or twice within one process, an invalid
page fault (exception 0E) may occur in Rpcss.exe.

This behavior is somewhat timing-dependent, and may not occur consistently on all
computers.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Since this behavior is somewhat timing-dependent, debug versions of the program
or Windows 95 may not exhibit this behavior at all.
