The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Mastering Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 ISBN 1-55615-913-7, version 1.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Setup for Mastering Access Programming on a computer running
Windows NT version 3.51, some of the Setup program dialog boxes do not fit in
the title bar.

A visible example of this behavior occurs when Setup concludes. The "Successfully
Completed" dialog box title is too big to display in the title bar.

STATUS
======

The behavior is by design and not a programming problem with Mastering Visual
Basic. This behavior will not affect operation of the program, and does not
indicate a problem with your system.
