TITLE   :BUG: Assumed-Size Array Allowed in Integer POINTER Statement
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using an assumed-size array for the pointer-based variable of an integer POINTER
statement does not cause a compile-time error though it should.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Regarding integer POINTER statements and their valid argument types, Page 109 of
the Microsoft Fortran PowerStation 4.0 Programmer's Guide, describes the use of
pointer-based variables as follows:

   The pointer-based variable cannot be a dummy argument, function name, or
   common block element.

Sample Code to Demonstrate Problem
----------------------------------

   C Compile options needed: none

         print *, 'hello'
         end

         subroutine MyFunc
         integer i, a
         pointer (i, a(*))    ! This should cause a compiler error.
         end
