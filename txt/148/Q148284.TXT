SUMMARY
=======

The Message Transfer Agent check utility (Mtacheck) is designed to provide a
soft recovery of a corrupted MTA database. It is automatically installed when
Microsoft Exchange Server is installed and can be found in the
%Exchange_Root%\Bin directory. This utility should be used when the MTA service
will not start due to corruption or suspected corruption in the MTA database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mtacheck must be run from a DOS VDM on the Microsoft Exchange Server. It is very
simple to use and only has 2 parameter, /v and /f. The parameters and the
results of their use are as follows:

Mtacheck.                  minimum logging.
Mtacheck /v                verbose logging.
Mtacheck /f <filename>     minimum logging that is saved to a text file.
Mtacheck /v /f <filename>  verbose logging that is saved to a text file.

For more information about the Mtacheck utility, please see pages 614-617 of the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator's Guide and the following article in the
