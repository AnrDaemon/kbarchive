TITLE   :PRB: When Event Fires Again Upon Leaving a Grid Column
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If there is only one column enabled in a grid and you try to use SetFocus to
move the focus programmatically to another object such as a command button, the
focus moves to the command button correctly but the grid also moves the active
grid cell to highlight the next available cell. Because there is only one active
column, there is no "next available cell," so the cell that's activated ends up
being the same that fired the When event, so the When event of that column fires
again.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are a number of workarounds for this situation:

 - Add a small dummy column to the grid so that the focus can move off the
   original cell that implemented the When event onto the dummy column.

-or-

 - Set the SelectedOnEntry property to False so that the effect is less
   noticeable.

-or-

 - If the problem is that the When event fires when you manually try to move to
   another object in the VALID, check for movement key presses such as TAB or
   ENTER in the KeyPress method of the column, and substitute with CTRL+TAB,
   which will prevent the attempt to move the pointer to the next column.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form. Place a grid (Grid1) and a command button (Command1) on
   the form.

2. Set the following properties of the Grid:

      ColumnCount=3
      Column1.Enabled=.F.
      Column2.Enabled=.T.
      Column3.Enabled=.F.

3. Place the following code in the When event for Grid1.Column2.Text1:

      WAIT WINDOW 'In WHEN for Col2' NOWAIT

4. Add the following code to the Valid method Grid1.Column2.Text1:

      THISFORM.Command1.SetFocus

5. Run the form, and press TAB from within the grid. The focus moves to
   Command1, but the When event of the grid still fires.

6. To remedy the problem, add the following code to the KeyPress method for
   Grid1.Column2.Text1:

      IF nKeyCode=9 OR nKeyCode=13
        NODEFAULT
        KEYBOARD '{CTRL+TAB}'
      ENDIF
