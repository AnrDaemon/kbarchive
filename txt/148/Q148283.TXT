TITLE   :XADM: Custom Attribute Values Replicate, but Names Do Not

SUMMARY
=======

Custom Attributes and Display Templates are best defined using an Organization
scope. It is best to maintain the same name for each attribute because the
values of the attributes will replicate but the names will not.

As an example, if an administrator from one site configures Custom Attribute 1 to
be Favorite Sport, and an administrator from a second site configures Custom
Attribute 1 to be Shoe Size, the value of this attribute will not make sense to
a user in the first site viewing a user in the second site. When the user from
the first site views a user from the second site, they could see an attribute
labeled Favorite Sport with a value of 7- 1/2.
