   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

In Windows NT 4.0, you can remotely control and configure Windows 95 registry
settings. This is accomplished by installing the Remote Registry service
(available on the Windows 95 CD-ROM in the Admin/Nettools folder) on both the
local computer and the remote Windows 95-based computer. User-level security and
remote administration must be enabled on the Windows 95-based computer.

Additional information regarding Remote Administration can be found in the
Windows 95 Resource Kit.

To control and configure registry settings, you must run Registry Editor
(Regedt32.exe).

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To connect to the Windows 95 computer's registry from a computer running Windows
NT, perform the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

2. Type "regedt32.exe" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

3. From the Registry menu, select Connect Network Registry.

4. Enter the computer name of the Windows 95 computer.
