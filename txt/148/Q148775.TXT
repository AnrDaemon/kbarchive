TITLE   :DragMode=Automatic Isn't Supported for the OLE Outline Control

SUMMARY
=======

Setting the DragMode property to Automatic is not supported for the Outline
control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is because DragMode is a property of the whole outline control. If it was
set to Automatic, it would create a situation where you would not be able to
access the control at all. The mouse click would initiate dragging rather than
collapsing and expanding the outline.

You can still use the Ouline control's Drag event with DragMode=Manual to achieve
a dragging effect. An example would be to use the PictureDblClick event with a
THIS.Drag.

For information on how to set and use manual drag and the drag icon property,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
