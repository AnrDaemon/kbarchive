The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you install Microsoft Exchange Server, the second dialog box, in which you
specify the type of installation, displays a Change Directory button that you
can use if you do not want to install Exchange Server in the default directory.
This is the only place you can change the installation location of the Exchange
Server and Books Online.

If you choose Complete/Custom as the type of installation, the next dialog box
also displays a Change Directory button. However, this button is only available
if the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator option is selected. You can
change the location of the Exchange Server Administrator program here, but not
the Exchange Server or Books Online.
