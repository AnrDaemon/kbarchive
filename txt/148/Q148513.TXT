SUMMARY
=======

It might be a good idea to freeze or pin a project to allow for a Code review
while development continues on a SourceSafe controlled software project. This
article shows by example how to do it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Back in the days when configuration management was done manually, there was a
point in the development cycle where code was frozen for code review by a
Quality Assurance team. This method of source control does not work in today's
fast-paced development cycle. SourceSafe is project oriented and therefore has a
different mechanism than other source control products for providing this
important functionality.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

Situation: An inprogress project Named myproject is ready for Quality Assurance
code review. Follow these steps:

1. Label myproject at the project level by highlighting the project in the
   SourceSafe Explorer and clicking the label icon.

2. Add a label, such as Submitted to QA.

3. Using the history icon, choose to retrieve labels only.

4. Select the proper label, and then click the share button.

5. Move the selector to the proper level (often, just one level up in the
   project tree), and name the new project "QA version." Select the recursive
   check box, if applicable, and click OK.

The newly created project will contain the project, pinned to the proper versions
for all contained files. Pins can be removed or changed if desired.
