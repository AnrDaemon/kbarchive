TITLE   :BUG: GO TO Statement Syntax Coloring Fails in Developer Studio
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Developer Studio, syntax coloring of the FORTRAN statement GO TO fails when a
space separates the syllables GO and TO.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the GOTO statement as a single word.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FORTRAN standard allows the GOTO statement to be represented as either GOTO
or GO TO; both statements are treated the same.

To illustrate the problem, copy the following source code into a text file in
Developer Studio. Save the text file using the .for source file extension. All
FORTRAN keywords are syntax colored except for the GO TO statement.

Sample Code to Illustrate Problem
---------------------------------

   C Compile options needed: none

         PARAMETER (LIMIT = 20)
         INTEGER SUM

   10    IF(SUM .LE. LIMIT) THEN
           SUM = SUM + 1
         GO TO 10      ! GO TO statement will not be syntax colored
         END IF

         END
