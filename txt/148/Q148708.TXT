TITLE   :No Network Access After Running Sclntupd.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msnets win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run Sclntupd.exe from Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1 on a shared
network installation of Windows 95, you may no longer be able to access the
network.

CAUSE
=====

When you run Sclntupd.exe, it copies a new Net.exe file to the Temp folder (as
defined in the "SET TEMP" statement in the Autoexec.bat file). If the Temp
folder is the Windows folder, the original Net.exe file is overwritten by the
new Net.exe file. When Sclntupd.exe finishes, it cleans up the Temp folder,
which includes deleting the Net.exe file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this situation, copy the Net.exe file from the Windows 95 Service
Pack 1 disks or CD-ROM to the local Windows folder.

To prevent the issue from occurring, modify the Autoexec.bat file before you run
Sclntupd.exe and then restart your computer. Modify the Autoexec.bat file so
that the "SET TEMP" and "SET TMP" statements point to a folder other than the
Windows folder. For example, modify the "SET TEMP" and "SET TMP" statements to
point to the C:\Windows\Temp folder.
