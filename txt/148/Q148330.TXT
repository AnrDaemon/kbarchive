SYMPTOMS
========

An internal consistency (IC) error occurs when you attempt to view the
properties of a connection using SQLGetProp in the DEBUG window.

CAUSE
=====

You are using an invalid connection handle in the SQLGetProp() function in the
DEBUG window.

RESOLUTION
==========

Print the return value of SQLGetProp() to the desktop or currently active window
using ? or \ printing as in this example:

      ? SQLGETPROP(<handle>, "BATCHMODE")

In this example, <handle> is a valid handle to the connection.

the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create an ODBC data source based on the Oracle 7.0 driver.

2. Create a database with a remote view based on the data source created in step
   1.

3. Open the remote view.

4. Open the Debug window, and type the following line in the left pane:

         SQLGetProp(3, "BATCHMODE")

   In this example, 3 is an invalid connection handle.
