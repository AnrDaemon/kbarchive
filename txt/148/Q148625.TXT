TITLE   :BUG: NAMELIST Output Incorrect with Renamed USE Variables
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you rename a module's NAMELIST group name and its object variables with the
USE statement and perform a WRITE of the NAMELIST, the original module NAMELIST
names are written instead of their aliases.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the output of the following sample code, the NAMELIST group name "&N" and
its object variable "J" are written to both the display and to the Namelist.fil
file when their aliases "&NN" and "JJ" should have been written.

Sample Code to Demonstrate Problem
----------------------------------

   C Compile options needed: none

         MODULE M
           NAMELIST /N/ I, J
         END MODULE

         PROGRAM NAME_LIST
           USE M , NN => N, JJ => J
           I = 1
           JJ = 2
           OPEN(UNIT=10,FILE="NAMELST.FIL",DELIM="APOSTROPHE")
           WRITE(10, NML=NN)
           REWIND 10
           READ(10,NN)
           WRITE(*,*) 'Got: '
           WRITE(*,NN)
           WRITE(*,'(" Expected:   ",A)') " &NN  I = 1, JJ = 2 /"
         END PROGRAM NAME_LIST

Output
------

Got:
&N
I =            1
J =            2
/ 
Expected:    &NN  I = 1, JJ = 2 /
