Normally, the Remote Access Service (RAS) Port Instance names are displayed as
COM1 and COM2. However, in Windows NT 3.51, Performance Monitor displays the RAS

formatted performance counters. This change causes a problem in the RAS counter
DLL. For more information on a related problem that affects Microsoft SQL Server
