SUMMARY
=======

When bringing up a dialog template that contains one or more OLE Controls, the
delay can be significant depending on the speed of the computer. You can use the
AfxOleLockControl() function to speed up the loading of the dialog by preloading
the control in the application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can load the OLE Control into the address space of the executable at any
time by using the AfxOleLockControl() function. There are two versions of this
function, one that takes a class id (CLSID) and one that takes a program id
(ProgID).

You can unload the control at any time by calling AfxOleUnlockControl() or
AfxOleUnlockAllControls(). There are two versions of AfxOleUnlockControl(), one
takes a class id and the other taking a program id.

If a splash screen is used by the application, that might be a good time to load
the controls. It can be done at any point after the call to
AfxEnableControlContainer() in the CWinApp::InitInstance(), and the loaded
controls can then be unloaded at any time.

REFERENCES
==========

These functions were not documented in Visual C++ 4.0 Help. You can find the
source code for these functions in Occlock.cpp in the \Msdev\Mfc\Src
subdirectory.
