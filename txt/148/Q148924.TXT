TITLE   :Dial-Up Scripting Does Not Work After Reinstalling DUN
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Dial-Up Scripting may no longer work after Dial-Up Networking is reinstalled.
The Dial-Up Scripting Tool shows that the correct script is applied to the
Dial-Up Networking connection icon, but when you double- click the connection
icon, Dial-Up Networking does not log you on and disconnects.

CAUSE
=====

Reinstalling Dial-Up Networking overrides entries in the registry that Dial-Up
Scripting requires to intercept the normal login procedure.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, reinstall Dial-Up Scripting. To do so, follow these
steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

2. On the Windows Setup tab, click Have Disk.

3. Type the path for the Rnaplus.inf file, and then click OK.

   NOTE: If you are using the Windows 95 CD-ROM, the path is

   <drive>:\Admin\Apptools\Dscript

   where <drive> is the drive letter for the CD-ROM drive.

4. Click the "SLIP and Scripting for Dial-Up Networking" check box to select it,
   and then click Install.

NOTE: These steps apply only to the retail release of Windows 95. This
information does not apply to Windows 95 OEM Service Release version 2.
