TITLE   :Stop 0x0000000A When Referencing Empty Sent Queue
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The following STOP error message in DLC.SYS appears on a Compaq computer using a
Netflex-2 network adapter:

   STOP: 0x0000000A (0x00000010,0x00000002,0x00000000,0xFb8eaf87)

NOTE: The fourth parameter, 0xFb8eaf87, may differ each time the STOP error
message appears because the base address for DLC differs from one system to
another.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs in the DLC transport when it attempts to access a NULL sent
queue. The sent queue is NULL due to either a spurious interrupt from the
network adapter or a problem with the driver overwriting the memory location it
should not. The Stop error message has occurred using a Compaq Netflex-2 network
adapter with or without the token ring module.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use another supported network adapter. Refer to the
latest Windows NT 3.51 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).

To correct this problem, apply the fix mentioned below.


STATUS
======

problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
