SYMPTOMS
========

When you are formatting text in WordPad, you may experience one or more of the
following problems:

 - When you select a section of colored text that contains more than one color
   and then click Font on the Format menu, the Effects area does not appear in
   the Font dialog box. The Effects area normally appears in the lower left
   corner of the Font dialog box and contains the Strikeout and Underline check
   boxes and the Color box.

 - When you click Font on the Format menu, the Automatic selection does not
   appear in the Color box.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around these problems, use the appropriate method:

 - To format a section of colored text that contains more than one color, format
   smaller sections of text that contain only one color at a time. For example,
   if you want to format a section of colored text that contains both black and
   red text, format the black text first, and then format the red text.

 - To change the text color to Automatic, select the section of text that you
   want to change, click the Color button on the toolbar, and then click
   Automatic.

   NOTE: If you do not see a Color button on the toolbar, you may need to turn on
   the format bar. To do so, click Options on the View menu, click the Format
   Bar check box to select it on the Text, Rich Text, Word 6, and Write tabs,
   and then click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
