-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the version 1.0b Connection Gateway can not successfully process a message
file, it will stop responding and may cause the server to not respond.

If the version 3.2 Mail Connection Gateway can not successfully process a message
file, it may generate a badmail file that will be placed in the MACGATE\BADMAIL
directory.

CAUSE
=====

The message contains an attachment with the following criteria:

 - Message with attachment that has a long file name created on Macintosh client
   for the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks mail server.

 - Message sent to a mailbox on a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks 3.x postoffice
   through the Mail Connection Gateway.

 - User accesses a mailbox from the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client
   included with Windows 95 using the SFS provider.

 - Message is forwarded to a mailbox on the AppleTalk server through the Mail
   Connection Gateway.

The Mail Connection Gateway may have difficulty with the name the Windows 95
Exchange clients uses to associate the attachment with the message.

RESOLUTION
==========

For the version 1.0b Connection Gateway, if a file named MSGATE.RDG is located
in the MSGATE\STORE\PCTOMAC directory, rename the file and restart the Microsoft
Mail Gateway services.

The user accessing the message from the Windows 95 Exchange client can save the
attachment and reattach. This will assign an 8.3 name to designate the
attachment within the message. An update to the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95
client included with the Microsoft Windows 95 has been released and is available
by contacting Product Support Services.
