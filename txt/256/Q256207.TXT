SYMPTOMS
========

When you create advertisements, the advertisements may never reach the client
computers. When this problem occurs, the following lines are displayed in the
Smsdbmon.log file:

not have the administrative permissions necessary to create triggers. Without
the ability to create triggers, the process to send out Systems Management
Server (SMS) advertisements does not start.
