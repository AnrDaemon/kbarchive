OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbATL kbConnPts kbVC600 kbVC600bug kbATL300 kbATL300bug kbDSupport kbGrpDSMFCATL

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) 3.0, included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you compile an Active Template Library (ATL) COM server project with
connection point support, you may receive the following error messages:

   testobj.h(76) : error C2065: 'IID__ITestObjEvents' : undeclared identifier

   testobj.h(76) : error C2440: 'static_cast' : cannot convert from 'class
   CTestObj *' to 'class ATL::_ICPLocator *' Types pointed to are unrelated;
   conversion requires reinterpret_cast, C-style cast or function-style cast

This problem typically occurs with projects in long directory paths.

CAUSE
=====

IID__ITestObjEvents is an incorrectly generated interface ID.

RESOLUTION
==========

Go to the file and line number that are listed in the error message above. In
the connection point map, change IID__ITestObjEvents to DIID__ITestObjectEvents
as follows:

   BEGIN_CONNECTION_POINT_MAP(CTestObject)
         //CONNECTION_POINT_ENTRY(IID__TestObjectEvents)
         CONNECTION_POINT_ENTRY(DIID__ITestObjectEvents)
   END_CONNECTION_POINT_MAP()

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

To reproduce this bug, perform the following steps:

1. Obtain the ATL Tutorial. In the MSDN version that shipped with Microsoft

   http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/devprods/vs6/visualc/vcmfc/_atl_atl_tutorial.htm

2. Follow the tutorial steps 1, 2, and 5 (you can omit steps 3 and 4) and create
   an ATL COM server in a long directory path; for instance, "C:\Program
   Files\Microsoft Visual Studio".

3. Build the application.
