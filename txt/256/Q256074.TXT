PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you remove the selection formula for a report and reschedule it to run,
the report may continue to run with the removed selection formula.

CAUSE
=====

The selection formula is not removed from the report even though the Selection
Formula box has been cleared. Replacing the formula with a new formula works.

WORKAROUND
==========

Make a new report object and run the report with the new object:

1. Right-click the report, point to All Tasks, and then click Schedule Report.

2. Under Report Properties, you see Report File. Write down the file path in
   this box.

3. Click Cancel.

4. Right-click the report folder in which you want to create the new report
   object, point to New, and then click Report Object.

5. Under Report Properties, add the path you wrote down in the Report File box.
   Provide a title for the new object, and a description if appropriate.
