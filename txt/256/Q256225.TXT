SUMMARY
=======

You may need to extract a user list from the AT&T Mail Gateway to Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks. You can do this by using the Import utility (Import.exe).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the AT&T Mail Gateway to Microsoft Mail for PC Networks is an SMTP
gateway, you must specify type SMTP for the gateway type when you use the Import
program to extract the user list.

Using the instructions for the Import utility supplied in Appendix A, pages
320-337 of the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Administrator's Guide, the command
line should be

   import admin -Ppassword -Ffilename -X -Gsmtp -Ddrive

where admin is the administrator's mailbox, password is the password for that
mailbox, filename is the name of the output file for the gateway users' list,
smtp is the gateway type, and drive is the drive letter the postoffice database
is mapped to.
