TITLE   :SMS: Hardware Inventory Uses SMSCliToknAcct& on Mapped Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWBEM kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbInventory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 client takes hardware inventory on a
system that has network drives mapped at the time inventory is taken, the
SMSCliToknAcct& account can be used. Because the SMSCliToknAcct& account
is not a domain account, but is a local account, its use on the network can lock
out the same account on the systems on which the network drives are mapped.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when the Windows Management service queries the
Win32_DiskDrive and Win32_DiskPartion WBEM classes to enumerate local drives.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can configure SMS Hardware Inventory not to query these particular WBEM
classes. For more information about accomplishing this task, please refer to the
"Systems Management Server 2.0 Administrator's Guide."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
