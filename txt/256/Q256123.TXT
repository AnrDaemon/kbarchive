======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In System Manager Server versions 2.0, and 2.0 SP1, the Logon Data Discovery
Records (DDRs) are not copied from the logon points to the site server.

Each Domain Controller in the site will then log numerous NT Event Log errors
that report failure to start the SMS Logon Discovery Agent service:

   Service Failed to start due to a logon failure: Error 1069

CAUSE
=====

If account lockout is enabled on the domain for X number of failed logon
attempts and an administrator manually changes the SMSLogonSvc account password
the SMSLogonSvc account will be locked out whenever X instances of the
SMS_LOGON_DISCOVERY_AGENT (LDA) is restarted.

Currently, there is no reliable way to ensure the SMSLogonSvc account will not be
subsequently locked out unless all logon points are uninstalled then
reinstalled. Even running a senior site update after changing the password will
not prevent the potential lockout. This behaviour occurs regardless of whether
or not the password is ever manually changed again.

The SMS_LOGON_DISCOVERY_AGENT service startup properties are not updated on logon
points whose SMS_LOGON_DISCOVERY_AGENT service is already running when the
senior site runs its update. At any point from then on, if X number of Logon
Point servers (Domain Controllers) are rebooted or their
SMS_LOGON_DISCOVERY_AGENT service is restarted within the "lockout reset count"
timeout window then the account will be locked out again.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Once the SMSLogonSvc account is locked out, an Administrator needs to disable
   Windows Networking Logon Discovery for all sites that share the NT domain
   containing the SMSLogonSvc account that keeps getting locked out.

2. Wait for the NT Logon Server Manager to uninstall the NT Logon Discovery
   Agent from all Domain Controllers. Once each site has updated the PDC and
   then the senior site has run a full update, the Logon Discovery Agent (LDA)
   and the SMSLogonSvc service will be removed completely from all DCs in the
   domain.

3. Re-enable Windows Networking Logon Discovery. When logon discovery is
   re-enabled the SMSLogonSvc account will be recreated with a new random
   password and the LDA service will be installed and started on each DC using
   this new password.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After each site has updated the PDC and then the senior site has run a full
Logon Point update, the SMS_LOGON_DISCOVERY_AGENT service will be removed
completely from all DCs in the domain.

When Logon Discovery is re-enabled the SMSLogonSvc account will be recreated with
a new random password and the SMS_LOGON_DISCOVERY_AGENT service will be
installed and started on each Domain Controller using this new password and the
SMSLogonSvc account will no longer be subject to lockouts.
