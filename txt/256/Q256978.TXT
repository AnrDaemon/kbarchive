SYMPTOMS
========

While you are capturing video data by using an Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1394 device, you may receive the following error
message:

   Insufficient system resources exist to complete the API

CAUSE
=====

While you are capturing or previewing video data, if you stop and restart the
video stream more than 20 times, you may receive the error message that is shown
in the "Symptoms" section. This problem is caused by a bandwidth leak in the
IEEE 1394 bus and video drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Windows NT 4.0.

This problem was first corrected in Windows 2000 Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem may not appear if you disconnect and then reconnect the IEEE 1394
device in between attempts to capture or preview video data, effectively making
a bus reset. Also, the problem may arise only if the video device is the
Isochronous Resource Manager (IRM). Once you receive this error, you won't be
able to restart the video capture.
