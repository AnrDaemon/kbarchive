-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade from Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 to Windows 2000 on a computer
that contains a display adapter based on the GLINT accelerator chipset, the
Setup program may display the following error message and disable the display
driver:

   The currently installed driver for the Glint based display adapter is not
   compatible with Microsoft Windows 2000 and will be disabled during the
   upgrade.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is due to incompatibilities that exist between early versions of
the driver and Windows 2000. Current drivers are compatible with Windows 2000,
but are incorrectly disabled as well.

RESOLUTION
==========

Download and install the latest drivers for the display adapter after upgrading
to Windows 2000.

The latest drivers for the Oxygen VX1 can be found at the following Web site:

   http://www.3dlabs.com/support/w2k.html

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The GLINT accelerator chipset is produced by 3Dlabs, and is available on display
adapters from several manufacturers.

On upgrade, the Windows 2000 Setup program disables the driver for all display
adapters that use a service key of "glint" in the Windows 2000/Windows NT 4.0
registry.

Additional adapters that are affected include the 3Dlabs Oxygen VX1 adapter,
which is also Windows 2000-compatible. More information is available on the
Oxygen VX1 adapter at the following Web site:
