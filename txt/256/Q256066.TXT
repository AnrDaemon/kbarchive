SUMMARY
=======

This article shows how to programmatically access the most common properties and
methods of the StatusBar ActiveX control using Visual FoxPro.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A StatusBar control provides a window, usually at the bottom of a parent form,
through which an application can display various kinds of status data. The
StatusBar control can be divided up into a maximum of sixteen Panel objects that
are contained in a Panels collection.
Running the following code illustrates some of the most common usages for the
StatusBar ActiveX control. To use this code, copy it into a new program in
Visual FoxPro and run it.

   Public frmOLETest
   Local lnPanels

   frmOLETest = CREATEOBJECT('Form') && Create Instance of the Form

   With frmOLETest 	&& Set Default Values for the Form
   	.CAPTION = 'StatusBar Control Test Form'
   	.WIDTH = 800
   	.HEIGHT = 200
   	.VISIBLE = .T.
   	.ADDOBJECT('OCXTest','StatusBarControl', ;
   		'MSComctlLib.sBarCtrl.2') && Create Instance of the StatusBar Control
   Endwith

   With frmOLETest.OCXTest 	&& Set Values and options of the StatusBar Control
   *!* Default Panel
   	.Panels(1).TEXT = "Sample Text" 	&& Default Text For Panel 1
   	.Panels(1).TOOLTIPTEXT = "Panel 1"
   	.Panels(1).STYLE = 0

   *!* Additional Panels
   	For lnPanels = 2 TO 8
                 .Panels.ADD()							&& Adds Panels 2 to 8
                 .Panels(lnPanels).STYLE = lnPanels - 1	&& Show each Panel Style
   *!* Style 0 = Text or Bitmap
   *!* 	 1 = Caps Lock
   *!*	 2 = Num Lock
   *!*	 3 = Insert
   *!*	 4 = Scroll Lock
   *!*	 5 = System Time
   *!*	 6 = System Date
   *!*	 7 = Kana entry (Japanese characters)
                 .Panels(lnPanels).TOOLTIPTEXT = "Panel " + ;
   			ALLTRIM(STR(lnPanels))
   	Endfor
   Endwith

   Define CLASS StatusBarControl AS OLECONTROL
   	Visible = .T.
   	Height = 25
   Enddefine
