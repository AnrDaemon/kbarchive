SUMMARY
=======

You cannot configure Internet Mail Service to listen to multiple TCP/IP ports.
However, you can configure the service to listen to a different TCP port for
incoming Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) connections. By default, Internet
Mail Service responds to port 25 connections.

This is a function of the TCP/IP protocol and is controlled by an entry in the
Services file located in the Winnt\System32\Drivers\Etc folder.

Additional query words: multiple ims
