PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbClient kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbUpgrade kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft System Management Server (SMS) 2.0 and 2.0 SP1, status messages are
not generated when the client base components are updated on the SMS 2.0 client
successfully (either by applying a hotfix or by a software upgrade). This can
make it difficult for an administrator to determine when an upgrade to SMS
clients has finished successfully.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server version 2.0 Service
Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================


Starting with Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 2 there is a Heartbeat
Discovery Data Record (DDR) generated after a base component version upgrade.
This DDR is created during the Client Component Installation Manager(CCIM) cycle
following the upgrade, and added to the database.

This new functionality is available with all upgrades after Systems Management
Server 2.0 SP2, but is not reported to the client base component version upgrade
when installing Service Pack 2.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
