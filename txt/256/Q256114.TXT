OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Exchange Server version 5.5, when you monitor the queue of outbound messages
awaiting conversion in the Internet Mail Service properties by using the
Exchange Server Administrator program, if a comma (,) is included in an e-mail
address, an access violation may occur.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if both ";" and "," are included in the specified e-mail
address and the Internet Mail Service conversion process for outbound messages
resolves to more than one correct e-mail address, because there is a issue with
the way that e-mail addresses are resolved in the conversion process that can
cause an access violation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
