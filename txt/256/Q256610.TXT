PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWBEM kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbInventory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade the computer BIOS on an existing SMS client with hardware
inventory enabled, the upgraded BIOS is not reflected in the SMS database. To
cause the new BIOS to be reflected in the SMS database, you must resynchronize
the client.

CAUSE
=====

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) queries the registry for BIOS
information. This information is not updated except when you install the
operating system.

WORKAROUND
==========

Force a hardware inventory resynchronization by using the Inventory Synchronizer
Tool (Invsync.exe) from the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
