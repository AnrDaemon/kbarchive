SUMMARY
=======

When you issue an FTP dir command against an IIS FTP server, one or more of the
files listed may not display the year created. Instead, the time created is
displayed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IIS FTP server is configured to display UNIX-style directory listings. As
per the UNIX specification, files created in the current year display the time
of creation instead of the year of creation.

Example:

   ftp> dir
   200 PORT command successful.
   150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for /bin/ls.
   -r-xr-xr-x   1 owner    group               1 Jun  3  1999 NotCurrentYear.txt
   -r-xr-xr-x   1 owner    group               1 Mar  6 21:11 CurrentYear.txt

If you require the time and year to be displayed, change to the MS-DOS directory
listing style. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Open the IIS Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

2. Edit the properties for the FTP service.

3. On the Home Directory tab, change the Directory Listing Style to MS-DOS.

4. Click OK.

5. Restart the FTP service.

After you make this change, the directory listing appears as follows:

   ftp> dir
   200 PORT command successful.
   150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for /bin/ls.
   06-03-99  10:57PM                    1 NotCurrentYear.txt
   03-06-00  09:11PM                    1 CurrentYear.txt

Additional query words: FTP UNIX date time timestamp year
