-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When users attempt to send a text message using Outlook 97, Outlook 98, or
Outlook 2000 with a profile that uses the Microsoft Mail information service,
they may receive the following non-delivery report (NDR) immediately:

   

   From:	System Administrator
   To:	administrator
   Sent:	Wednesday, March 01, 2000 2:07 PM
   Subject:	Undeliverable: Test message
   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

      Subject:	Test message
      Sent:	3/1/2000 2:07 PM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

      administrator on 3/1/2000 2:07 PM
            The message could not be sent due to an unknown failure. 
            Try sending the message again. If the message cannot be sent, 
            contact your administrator.

NOTE: If users attempt to send a text message with the Microsoft Mail Client for
MS-DOS (Mail.exe) or the Microsoft Mail client for Windows, the message
successfully reaches its destination. However, messages sent with attachments
with all clients fail.

CAUSE
=====

The Att subfolder of the postoffice database is missing or damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the Att subfolder is missing or damaged, you may need to restore it and all
of its 16 subfolders from a valid backup. If a backup is not available, you can
recreate the folders manually. To do so, from a command prompt:

1. Change to the root of the postoffice database. This is usually drive M.

2. Create the ATT folder by using the makedir or md command. For example:

   md att

3. Change to the root of the ATT folder, for example:

   cd att

4. Create the Att subfolders by using the makedir or md command. The subfolders
   are:

   At0
   At1
   At2
   At3
   At4
   At5
   At6
   At7
   At8
   At9
   Ata
   Atb
   Atc
   Atd
   Ate
   Atf

5. Copy the Populate.msm file from another subfolder of the postoffice database
   to the root of the Att folder and all of the subfolders created in the
   previous steps.

   NOTE: If the folders must be rebuilt manually, you may have some users
   reporting errors when they open some of their messages with attachments.
   These users should request that the sender resend the message with the
   attachment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Att folder is where message attachments are stored. The Populate.msm file is
a placeholder file to ensure that the folder is not completely empty.
