-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You cannot increase the population limit when you play a custom scenario in
Microsoft Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. The population limit is set to
75, and there is no option to change this limit to a higher number.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Due to the functionality and the resource information that is used to create a
custom scenario, no option is available to change the population limit, either
when you create the custom scenario, or when you play a custom scenario.

This behavior is by design.
