TITLE   :ClipBook Viewer Prompts for Network Access Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user starts ClipBook Viewer (Clipbk.exe), the following dialog box may be
displayed:

   Enter Network Access Password for Server: <computer name>, DDE Share
   CLPBK$

Regardless of the password or account that is used, an "Incorrect Password" error
message is displayed.

CAUSE
=====

The Enter Network Access Password dialog box is displayed if the user does not
have the correct network access rights because Clipbk.exe uses Network Dynamic
Data Exchange (NetDDE) to communicate. Checking the user rights in User Manager
may also show that the correct user account is listed, but that the user account
was originally in another domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Start User Manager.

2. On the Policies menu, click User Rights.

3. Verify that "Access this computer from the network" is selected in the Right
   box, or that the Domain Users global group is listed.
