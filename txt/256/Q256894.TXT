TITLE   :Windows 95 Clients Hang at Startup Randomly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) clients that are running Microsoft Windows 95
may stop responding (hang) randomly at startup. When this occurs, both
Explorer.exe and Microsoft Office Toolbar are displayed as "Not responding" in
the Close Program dialog box; you must reboot the client computer to continue.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if two Clisvc95.exe threads are running at the same
time. The first thread owns an object that the second thread needs. Because one
thread is not responding to a system broadcast message, the rest of the system
hangs pending the message delivery. Both threads are attempting to load a
dynamic-link library (DLL); because they currently own each other's lock, the
process deadlocks.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2. For additional information regarding this fix please
