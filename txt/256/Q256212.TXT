TITLE   :Software Metering Client Agent Can Lock Out Domain User Account
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsMeter kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Software Metering on a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0
client that is running Microsoft Windows NT, a user's domain account can become
locked out. If the user is logged on to the local computer (not the domain), the
Software Metering agent attempts to connect to the Software Metering server by
using the local user account. If an account of the same name but with a
different password exists in the domain, the domain account can become locked
out because of too many invalid logon attempts.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Software Metering client agent connects to the
Software Metering server by using the logged-on user's security context.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

Ensure that users are logged on to the domain and not the local computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
