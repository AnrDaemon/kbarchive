   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create, open, or execute a project in Visual C++ version 6.0, the
following error message is displayed:

   SHSQL.DLL

   This required file cannot be loaded. Please re-install Microsoft Visual C++.

   EESWT.DLL

   This required file cannot be loaded. Please re-install Microsoft Visual C++.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Visual C++ Enterprise Edition setup fails to
remove some registry keys. The following are two possible reasons that the
Visual C++ Enterprise Edition setup fails to remove registry keys:

 - Failure with the uninstallation process.

 - Visual C++ files and directories have been deleted by the end user.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

   Q248697 HOWTO: Manually Uninstall Visual Studio with MSDN Library

NOTE: If you plan to install the Visual C++ Professional Edition on the same
computer that is running the Visual C++ Enterprise Edition, then rename or
delete the following registry key before you install Visual C++ to avoid the
error messages.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\shsql.dll

MORE INFORMATION
================

Both the Shsql.dll file and the Eeswt.dll file are only shipped with the Visual
C++ Enterprise Edition. If the uninstallation process of the Visual C++
Enterprise Edition is not complete, then Enterprise-specific registry keys
remain. The registry keys that remain cause errors with the installation of
other editions of Visual C++.

NOTE: Always uninstall Visual C++ from the Add/Remove Programs tool in the
Control Panel. You cannot uninstall Visual C++ if you only delete Visual C++
files and directories.
