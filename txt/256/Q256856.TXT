TITLE   :XIMS: "550 Relaying Is Prohibited" Error Returned for Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enable the "Do Not Reroute Incoming SMTP mail" option on the Routing
tab in Internet Mail Service (IMS) and your previously configured routing
restrictions are still in place, a "550 Relaying is prohibited" error message
may be displayed for all incoming e-mail messages. This behavior occurs even
though the message recipient is found in the Exchange Server global address
list.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you enable the "Do Not Reroute Incoming SMTP mail"
option. This option is an old setting from Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0. When
this feature is active, e-mail messages are not routed because e-mail messages
are not delivered.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you want to restrict Internet Mail Service from being used as a relay and
make sure the "550 relay prohibited" error message is displayed, use the
following steps:

1. Enable the Reroute Incoming SMTP Mail option.

2. Click Routing Restrictions.

3. Click to select the "Hosts and clients with these IP addresses" check box,
   and then click OK.

4. Stop and restart Internet Mail Service.
