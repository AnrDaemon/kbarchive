SUMMARY
=======

Unicode applications that only target Microsoft Windows 2000 do not need to
retest localized versions of that application. These applications should be
submitted for testing in the language where you expect the most units to be
sold.

American National Standards Institute (ANSI)-based applications may need as many
as three tests to cover all languages: one test each for single-byte languages,
double-byte languages, and complex script languages. See the "More Information"
section for a description of which language categories you need to cover.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Unicode Apps That Target Only Windows 2000
------------------------------------------

A Windows 2000-based application that registers as a Unicode application does not
need to retest localized versions of that application. The application must be
submitted in the primary language version in which it is to be marketed; that
is, where the most units are expected to be sold. VeriTest tests the application
by using the matching localized versions of Windows. If the application passes
Microsoft Windows 2000 logo-compliance testing in the primary language version,
the logo can be used for all localized versions of that application.

ANSI-Based Applications
-----------------------

Because of the differences among ANSI applications of different languages, the
Windows 2000 logo can be used only for localized versions of a product that are
in the same language category as the product that is tested. The following list
shows the language categories:

 - Single-Byte Language Category

   English, German, French, Spanish, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian,
   Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, Czech, Slovenian, Greek, Hungarian,
   Polish, Turkish, Slovak

 - Double-Byte Language Category

   Japanese, Korean, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese

 - Complex Script Language Category

   Arabic, Hebrew, Thai

NOTE: If you localize to a language that is not listed here, please send e-mail
to:

   winlogo@microsoft.com

For each language category, an application must be submitted for testing in the
primary language version in which it is to be marketed. To license the Microsoft
Windows 2000 logo for any version of the application in another language
category, you must submit one version of the application localized to a language
in the intended category, plus a retest fee. Once this version of the
application passes compliance testing, the logo is licensed for use with all
languages within that language category.

For example, if an application is submitted in English and passes in English, the
logo can be used on the packaging and advertising for the English version and
also for any language that is listed in the single-byte category. However, the
logo cannot be used on the Japanese version unless the application is also
submitted and passes in Japanese or another double-byte language.
