SYMPTOMS

After you use the Database Interface Wizard to create a Database Editor Web
page, you may receive an error message similar to the following:

   Database Results Error
   Description: [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver] Syntax error in UPDATE
   statement.
   Number: -2147217900 (0x80040E14)
   Source: Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers

   form fields that are used in the query.

   -or-

   Database Results Error
   Description: [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver] Field '<Table
   Name>. <Field Name>' cannot be a zero-length string.
   Number: -2147467259 (0x80004005)
   Source: Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers

   One or more form fields were empty. You should provide default values for all
   form fields that are used in the query.

where <Table Name> is the table in the database, and <Field Name> is
the field in the database.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you attempt to update a database record that has an
empty field. The setting for the database column does not allow zero-length
entries.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, make sure that all data fields that do not allow
zero-length entries are populated before you submit the form.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, start Microsoft Access and then open the database
table in Design view. Set the Allow Zero Length attribute to Yes for each field
that you want to allow blank entries.
