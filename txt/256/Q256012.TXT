======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 to Windows 2000, all Crystal
Reports services may be installed as local system accounts. As a result, the
Crystal Reports service does not start or run the Info Agent, Info APS, and Info
Sentinel services.

CAUSE
=====

The Crystal Reports services must run with the SMS Service account.

WORKAROUND
==========

After you upgrade to Windows 2000 and install SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2, use the
Services tool in Control Panel to change the Crystal Reports services (Info
Agent, Info APS, and Info Sentinel) to use the SMS Service account.
