TITLE   :XFOR: MS Mail Interchange Service Stops Processing Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The flow of e-mail messages between Microsoft Mail and Exchange Server may stop
without any error message being displayed in the application event log. If you
view the performance log, you can see the MSExchangeMSMI service has stopped
processing messages. If you restart the MSExchangeMSMI service, the flow of
e-mail messages resumes. However, after some time, the flow of e-mail messages
stops again.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there are too many files in the Att and Mai folders.
If there are too many *.att or *.mai files in these folders, the MSExchangeMSMI
service stops processing messages.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove the old *.att and *.mai files:

1. In Windows NT Explorer, locate the Exchsrvr\Connect\Msmcon\Maildata folder.

2. Right-click the folder, and then click Find.

3. In the Named box, type "*.att;*.mai" (without the quotation marks).

4. Click to select the files in the list on the right, and then delete them.
