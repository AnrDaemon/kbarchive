TITLE   :RAS Client May Not Be Authenticated When You Reconnect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP6,4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a computer that is running Remote Access Services (RAS), you
are successfully authenticated by a Windows NT 4.0-based domain controller.
However, if you disconnect and then immediately reconnect, you may receive the
following error message:

   A domain controller for your domain could not be contacted. You have been
   logged on using cached account information. Changes to your profile since you
   last logged on may not be available.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the RAS client receives a new Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) address from the RAS server when you
reconnect. The authenticating domain controller does not update its local
NetBIOS name cache with the new TCP/IP address of the RAS client, causing the
RAS client authentication not to succeed.

RESOLUTION
==========
