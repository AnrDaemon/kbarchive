TITLE   :SMS: Smsapm32.exe Does Not Stop When Client Agent Is Upgraded
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbClient kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbAdvertisement kbSoftwareDist kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 client attempts to upgrade or
reinstall the software distribution client agent when an advertisement is being
run, the Smsapm32.exe process may not stop. This is necessary for the upgrade of
the client agent to succeed.

CAUSE
=====

This is an intermittent problem that only appears to occur when a mapped network
drive or universal naming convention (UNC) path is specified in the system path
of the client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, place the network drive or UNC path in the user's
path environment variable by using the "PATH =" statement in the user's logon
script.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is not a good practice to place a mapped network drive or UNC path in the
system path environment variable. This can result in an unanticipated amount of
network traffic because many processes rely on the system path to load
supporting files instead of loading them with an explicit path.

In addition, if you plan on upgrading the SMS client components, you should
postpone any mandatory program advertisements until after the software
distribution component is upgraded.
