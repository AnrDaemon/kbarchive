TITLE   :Cluster Server Cannot Use Disk Beyond Device Number 25
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using an array of 30 disks, Disk Administrator can access,
partition, format, and assign drive letters to any drive in the system. With
Microsoft Cluster Server installed, you can use any disk provided that the disk
has a device number in the range of from 0 to 25.

CAUSE
=====

This limitation is caused by a hard-coded value for the disk resource DLL, which
should be set to maximum disks (which equates to 100).

==========

To resolve this issue, apply the hotfix described in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:
