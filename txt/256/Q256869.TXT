======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows NT-based hardware inventory does not report network printers
if you modify the MOF file to report the Printer class. Hardware inventory for
clients running Microsoft Windows 95/Microsoft Windows 98 reports network
printers as expected.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is present in all instances of Systems Management Server 2.0 as it
is due to architectural issues in the NT Operating System. In Windows 95/Windows
98, all printers (local and network) are available to all users. The Hardware
Inventory agent (Hinv32) in Windows NT runs under the SMS Client Token account.
When it starts the inventory cycle, it calls Windows Management Instrumentation
(WMI) for all the requested inventory information, including the printer
information.

WMI then redirects that request to the Win32 provider. The Win32 provider running
under the Local System account impersonates the caller/client (that is, Hinv32)
and accesses the information by using the SMS Client Token account. In Windows
NT, the printer information that the Win32 provider returns includes the local
printers and the network printers belonging to the SMS Client Token account
(because that is the profile that Hinv32 is running under). This account, by
default, does not have any network printers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
