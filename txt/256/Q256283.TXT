SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose full or summary hit highlighting for one of your search results,
you may receive the following error message:

   The pipe has ended

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs if the document you are trying to run hit highlighting
against is located on a virtual root that points to a UNC path on another
computer. By default, the folder that contains the hit highlighting code
(Inetpub/Iissamples/Issamples/Oop) is set to run out of process. When it id run
out of process, it cannot access data on remote computers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, perform the following steps:

1. In the IIS Microsoft Management Console (MMC), locate the Web site that the
   search is under.

2. Right-click the Inetpub/Iissamples/Issamples/Oop folder, and then click
   Properties.

3. On the Directory tab, click to uncheck the Run in separate memory space
   (isolated process) check box.

The folder will now execute in process and allow the hit highlighting code to
successfully work on data that is on virtual roots pointing to UNC shares.
