KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are scheduling Crystal Reports on a Microsoft Windows 2000-based
Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 site server, the following error message may
be displayed:

   Can't open SQL server

CAUSE
=====

The WMI ODBC driver does not connect to WMI because Crystal Reports always
passes credentials, even if it is running locally. It incorrectly passes
explicit credentials to Windows 2000, which rejects the request because explicit
credentials are being supplied on the local computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
