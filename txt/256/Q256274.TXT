SYMPTOMS
========

When running a search using HTM, IDQ, HTX files, the client may receive the code
of the IDQ page in its browser instead of search results.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the folder that contains the IDQ file has not been
set as an application, or one of its parent folders is not marked as an
application, you may see .

Also, if you do not make an HTTP connection to the HTM file when you attempt to
do a query, the code of the IDQ page appears on the screen.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. In the management console for IIS, select the folder that contains the IDQ
   file, and then click Properties.

2. On the Directory tab, select Application Settings, and then click Create.
   This sets the folder as an application.

3. Click the Configuration button. Verify that there is an entry for the IDQ
   file in the App Mappings list, and that it is mapped to Idq.dll.

4. Make sure that the connection you are testing the query over is an HTTP
   connection. You cannot double-click the HTM file. You must make a connection
   through the Web server using http.
