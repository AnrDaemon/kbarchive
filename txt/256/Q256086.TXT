SUMMARY
=======

When you play Microsoft Allegiance, you may be able to shoot at and hit friendly
missiles, even if the Allow Friendly Fire option is disabled.

The Allow Friendly Fire option only applies to ships and bases and not to
missiles. For this reason, do not fire at friendly missiles unless you want to
destroy them.
