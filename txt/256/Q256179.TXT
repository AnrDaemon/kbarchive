TITLE   :PRB: BackColor of Shape Bleeds Through on Top-Level Form w/ Grid
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbContainer kbCtrl kbvfp600 kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have a form with the ShowWindow property equal to 2 (As Top-Level Form) and
the form contains a grid and text boxes on top of a shape object. As you tab
through the text box objects, the background color of the shape may bleed
through into your text boxes even if the shape object's BackColor property is
set to the default.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, either avoid the use of shapes to group affected text
boxes, or run the form in another top-level form.

If you are using a transparent shape, as in the following sample, another
workaround is to set the shape's BackColor property in the form's Init event to
be the same as the back color of the text boxes.

NOTE: This workaround does not allow for changes in the Windows color settings in
the middle of the application but should cover most cases.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Use the following steps to reproduce this behavior:

1. Create and run a program with the following code:

   PUBLIC oform1

   oForm1 = NEWOBJECT("form1")
   oForm1.Show()

   RETURN

   DEFINE CLASS form1 AS form

   	Top = 0
   	Left = 0
   	Height = 443
   	Width = 622
   	ShowWindow = 2  && As Top-Level Form
   	Caption = "Bleedthrough Demonstration"
   	Name = "Form1"

   	ADD OBJECT grdDemo AS grid WITH ;
   		ColumnCount = 1, ;
   		Height = 180, ;
   		Left = 30, ;
   		Top = 30, ;
   		Width = 555, ;
   		Name = "grdDemo"

   	ADD OBJECT txtOne AS textbox WITH ;
   		Height = 23, ;
   		Left = 177, ;
   		Top = 255, ;
   		Width = 100, ;
   		Name = "txtOne"

   	ADD OBJECT txtTwo AS textbox WITH ;
   		Height = 23, ;
   		Left = 177, ;
   		Top = 294, ;
   		Width = 100, ;
   		Name = "txtTwo"

   	ADD OBJECT txtThree AS textbox WITH ;
   		Height = 23, ;
   		Left = 177, ;
   		Top = 333, ;
   		Width = 100, ;
   		Name = "txtThree"

   	ADD OBJECT shpGroup AS shape WITH ;
   		Top = 225, ;
   		Left = 33, ;
   		Height = 186, ;
   		Width = 552, ;
   		BackStyle = 0, ;
   		BackColor = RGB(255,0,128), ;
   		Name = "shpGroup"

   	PROCEDURE Init
   		*!* Uncomment next line for a workaround
   		*!* This.shpGroup.BackColor = This.txtOne.BackColor
   	ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

2. After the form appears, tab through the text boxes.

3. Notice that the background color of the text boxes changes.

4. Close the form, uncomment the code in the Init procedure and then run the
   program again to see the workaround.
