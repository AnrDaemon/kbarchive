SUMMARY
=======

FoxToXML.prg is a program file that creates a custom FoxPro class that uses a
FoxPro cursor or table to create an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) page and an
eXtensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) style sheet to display FoxPro data.

The FoxPro class (FoxToXML) has a method that creates an XML file, a method that
creates an XSL file, and a method that creates both files. Each method takes
either no parameter and uses the currently open cursor or table to create the
XML/XSL files or takes a table name as a parameter to create the files.

The creation of the XML/XSL documents uses native Visual FoxPro 6.0 language and
the custom class can be instantiated and used whenever an XML or XSL document is
needed. The XML/XSL document names are derived from the cursor or table name.

Without the XSL file, the XML data displays in hierarchical form. Create just an
XML file and delete the "?xml-stylesheet ..." line to see how the XML data looks
without the style sheet.

The FoxToXML.EXE file contains the following files:

+-----------------------+
| Table Name   | Size   | 
+-----------------------+
| FoxToXML.PRG | 7.25KB | 
+-----------------------+
| FoxToXML.HTM | 1.95KB | 
+-----------------------+

FoxToXML.exe is a self-extracting zipped file that contains a Visual FoxPro 6.0
program file and a readme file called FoxToXML.HTM.

The FoxToXML program file contains code that creates a FoxPro custom class with
three methods that create an XML file, an XSL file, or both files. Once the
zipped files have been extracted, the XML and XSL files can be created as
follows:

1. Create a new program called "Test.prg" (without the quotation marks), and add
   the following code:

   CD JUSTPATH(SYS(16))
   USE ? && Choose any FoxPro table
   oXML = NEWOBJECT("FoxToXML","FoxToXML.PRG")
   oXML.BOTH

2. Save the program as TEST.PRG in the same directory as FoxToXML.PRG.

3. Run TEST.PRG. This creates both an XML and XSL file with the name of the open
   table or cursor.

Alternatively, the following code creates an XML file with the name XYZ.XML (the
name of the cursor):

   SELECT * FROM tablename into CURSOR xyz
   SET PROCEDURE TO FoxToXML.PRG
   oXML = CREATEOBJECT("FoxToXML")
   oXML.XML

This code creates XML and XSL files in the default directory with the same name
as the currently selected table or cursor. Double-click the XML file to display
the FoxPro data in the default Internet browser.
