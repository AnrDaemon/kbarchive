KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbAdvertisement

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 client that
is running on a laptop computer may report advertisement status messages to
sites to which it is incorrectly assigned, along with the site to which it is
correctly assigned.

When a client receives and runs an advertisement, "Program Started" and "Program
Completed" messages appear to be reported to each site to which the client
thinks it is assigned and installed. This results in a skewed number of status
messages for the program status for the client.

CAUSE
=====

The conditions that can result in this behavior are documented in the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

   Q247543 SMS: Clients Incorrectly Assigned to Multiple Sites

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
