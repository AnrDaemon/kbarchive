======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server 2.0, software distribution can be deployed using
the package routing method (fan-out method). This means a central site can
target a package to a grandchild site without having a direct address defined
from the central site to the grandchild site.

However this can fail when the distribution is configured for medium priority,
resulting in a prevention of the package from completing to the target
grandchild site.

For example, distributing a package from Site A to Site C:

   Site A   ---- Central Site
     |
   Site B   ---- Child Site
     |
   Site C   ---- Grandchild Site

CAUSE
=====

The Scheduler thread will periodically go through the routing packages and
delete any routing packages that are not referenced by a send request. The
routing packages are usually represented as a local path. However, there are
instances where the send requests refer to the routing package using a UNC path.
When this happens the Scheduler is unable to resolve a UNC path to a local path
even if both paths point to the same file.

This can also occur when the Sender address from Site B to Site C is configured
to allow only high priority packages to be sent over several hours, before
switching to allow medium and high.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, create a direct address to the target site.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2. This problem was first corrected in Systems
Management Server version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
