TITLE   :XADM: Server Delegate Rule Is Disabled by External E-Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix kbgraphxlinkcritical

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Delegate rules may be disabled when those rules act on e-mail messages sent
through a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) port.

CAUSE
=====

Because a delegate rule works with Exchange Server addresses, the information
store disables the rule when it encounters an error if the e-mail message is
sent from non-Exchange Server address. After the rule is disabled, the rule does
not start, even if the e-mail message is sent from Microsoft Outlook.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
