TITLE   :SMS: Status Messages Are Not Displayed in SQL Server Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbStatSum

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In some situations, you may notice that status messages are being reported in
Systems Management Server (SMS), but the detailed messages that accompany the
status messages are not displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you use Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 to run the SMS 2.0
database. By default, the SQL Server computer's system memory is set to 8,192
pages (or 16 MB). On Japanese computers, this can be insufficient for running
certain SMS stored procedures because of the extra memory required for wide
characters in the Japanese character set.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, increase the amount of system memory available to SQL
Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Status messages allow administrators to monitor SMS system operations.
