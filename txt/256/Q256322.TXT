TITLE   :Error Configuring IIS to Use Samba Network Share As Its Root
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to specify a Samba network share for an IIS virtual directory root
or Web site root, the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) generates an "Access is
Denied" error message, and the new virtual directory or site has a stop sign
icon next to it. However, if you use the NET command, you can map a drive letter
to the Samba network share with no problems.

When there is no network connection open, IIS cannot list the files, and the
"Access is Denied" error message occurs even though the user has root access to
the share and its contents.

When a network connection is open, IIS can then list the contents of the share,
but a user cannot browse to the default file. (A stop sign icon still appears
next to the virtual directory.)

If you map a drive letter to the share, and IIS is configured to search for the
mapping, a user can successfully browse to that site. (A stop sign icon still
appears next to the virtual directory.)

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Samba is not configured to encrypt passwords that are
sent across the network.

RESOLUTION
==========

On the computer running Windows NT Server, remove the following registry entry
to enable plain-text passwords (if the entry previously existed):

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rdr\Parameters\
   EnablePlainTextPassword (DWORD Value=1)

Configure the Smb.cnf configuration file on the Samba server to reflect the
following:

   [Global]
   Workgroup = (Windows NT Server name)
   Security = Server
   Encrypt Passwords = Yes

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

1. Map a drive letter to \\<servername>\iisroot using "root" and
   "password."

2. In the Samba virtual directory, change the home directory from Share on
   Another Computer to Local Directory, and then specify the drive letter that
   you mapped in the previous step.

3. Restart the Web site, and then test it by browsing.

NOTE: This method involves a security risk, because the user that created the
mapping must remain logged on to the local console. Therefore, the only security
is by locking the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Further support for the UNIX/Samba configuration can be obtained from Samba.
