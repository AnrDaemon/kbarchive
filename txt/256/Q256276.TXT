SYMPTOMS
========

When you type in a query, and then click the Go button to execute the query, the
query does not return. Instead, you receive a page that displays the following
error message:

   There is no catalog

CAUSE
=====

The catalog specified in either the code of the query page or the default
catalog path in the registry is invalid.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you do not specify a catalog in your code, Index Server finds the path to the
default catalog using following registry key, and then uses that catalog:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ContentIndex

The path is located under the IsapiDefaultCatalogDirectory value and should be
the same as the physical path to the directory that contains the Catalog.wci
directory.

If you choose to specify your catalog in the code of your pages, the method you
use depends on how you are doing your queries. In an IDQ file, use a command
line similar to the following:

   CiCatalog=<catalogpath>

where <catalogpath> is the same as the path to the directory that contains
the Catalog.wci directory. For example, if the physical path to your Catalog.wci
folder is C:\Inetpub\Catalogs\Catalog.wci, then your CiCatalog line will be
similar to the following:

   CiCatalog=C:\Inetpub\Catalogs

The CiCatalog variable should be located in the [Query] section of the IDQ file.

In an ASP file, use the Q.Catalog line to specify the name of the catalog to be
queried.

NOTE: This example uses the IXSSO object and is based on Query.asp, which is
installed by default with Index Server.

In the Query.asp page, find the section that resembles the following:

   set Q = Server.CreateObject("ixsso.Query")
           set util = Server.CreateObject("ixsso.Util")
       Q.Query = CompSearch
       Q.SortBy = "rank[d]"
       Q.Columns = "DocTitle, vpath, filename, size, write, characterization, rank"
       Q.MaxRecords = 300

To specify a catalog in the ASP page, add a Q.Catalog line so that section
appears follows:

   set Q = Server.CreateObject("ixsso.Query")
           set util = Server.CreateObject("ixsso.Util")
       Q.CATALOG="<catalogname>"
       Q.Query = CompSearch
       Q.SortBy = "rank[d]"
       Q.Columns = "DocTitle, vpath, filename, size, write, characterization, rank"
       Q.MaxRecords = 300

The Q.Catalog line that you add has a value equal to the name of your catalog as
it appears in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for Index Server.
