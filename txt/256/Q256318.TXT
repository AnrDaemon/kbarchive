   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Domain Name Service (DNS) may not start and the following error
messages may be recorded in the Event log:

   Event ID:501
   Source:DNS
   DNS Server zone <xxxx> has a missing or corrupt zone type in registry.
   Fix type, or delete from registry and recreate with DnsAdmin.

   Event ID: 500
   Source: DNS
   DNS Server zone <xxxx> has invalid or corrupt registry data. Delete it's
   registry data and recreate with DnsAdmin.

   Event ID: 7023
   Source: Service Control Module
   The Microsoft DNS Server Service terminated with the following error:
   The data is invalid

CAUSE
=====

The Notify option may have been used on one or more of the automatically created
zones. This occurs if an IP address is specified in the zone properties or the
"Only Allow Access from Secondaries Included on Notify List" option is enabled.
The following zones are automatically created and should not have any Notify
options selected:

   0.in-addr.arpa
   127.in-addr.arpa
   255.in-addr.arpa

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this problem, delete the pertinent automatically created zone from the
registry by using Regedt32.exe. The zones are located in the following area:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Zones

Click the zone, and then click Delete on the Edit menu. Quit Regedt32.exe, and
then type the following line at a command prompt:

   net start dns

The deleted zone is automatically created when the DNS service starts.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the DNS service in Windows NT
4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Automatically created zones are not normally present in the registry. They are
created when the DNS service is started. When the Notify option is set, however,
the zone is present in the registry in location listed in the "Resolution"
section.
