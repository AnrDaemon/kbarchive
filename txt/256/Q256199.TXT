SYMPTOMS
========

When you migrate users from other e-mail systems (such as Lotus cc:Mail or Lotus
Notes) to Exchange Server by using the Exchange Server Migration Wizard, the
following error messages may be logged in Windows NT application event log:

   Event Type: Error
   Event Source: MSExchangeMig
   Event ID: 8074
   Description:

   Event Type: Error
   Event Source: MSExchangeMig
   Event ID: 8124
   Description:
   Parser Error C:\Misc\Temp\TestMig\Notes.002\00000001.PRI Line: 4
   Bad section encountered. The remainder of this section will be skipped.

   Event Type: Error
   Event Source: MSExchangeMig
   Event ID: 8002
   Description:
   Errors occurred during the Migration Process. A recovery file has been created
   called C:\TEMP\00000012.PRI.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem can occur if you use the two-step migration process and, during the
first step, you click to clear the "Information to create mailboxes" check box.
If you do this, the second step of the two-step migration process does not work
unless you already have an existing mailbox or custom recipient for the users in
the Exchange Directory that you want to migrate.

To ensure that you have an entry in the Exchange Server directory before
migration, either manually create a mailbox for the user or create a custom
recipient by using the directory synchronization process. Alternatively, allow
the migration process to create a mailbox by clicking to select the "Information
to create mailboxes" check box.
