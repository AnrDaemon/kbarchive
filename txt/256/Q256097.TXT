OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a program is advertised to both Microsoft Windows NT-based and Microsoft
Windows 98/95-based clients by using the "Only when no user is logged on" option
on the Environment tab of your package's program item, administrators do not
receive an error message from Windows 98/95-based clients if the program does
not run.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the "Only when no user is logged on" option is
designed to be used only by Windows NT-based clients.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make 2 advertisements, one for Windows NT-based
clients, and one for Windows 98/95-based clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
