KEYWORDS:aoe kbimu msgame kbGraphxLink kbgraphxlinkcritical

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Age of Empires II Expansion: The Conquerors 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select a unit or a building in Microsoft Age of Empires II: The Age of
Kings or Microsoft Age of Empires II Expansion: The Conquerors, some of the
command buttons for that unit or building may not appear in the bottom left
corner of the screen.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the any of the following conditions is true:

 - The advanced commands are turned off.

 - More commands are available for the unit than the game can display on one
   screen.

 - You have not yet researched the technologies or advanced to the required Age
   or level for that command, or your civilization does not support that
   command.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Click the Advanced Commands Button
----------------------------------

To make advanced commands such as Kill Your Unit ([GRAPHIC:the skull]) and Flank
Formation ([GRAPHIC:two pairs of white dots under a red triangle]) available,
click the Turn Advanced Commands On button located to the right of the mini-map
in the bottom right corner of the screen.

Click the Red Arrow
-------------------

If you see the More button ([GRAPHIC:the red arrow]) at the bottom of the command
list when you select a unit or building, click this button to view additional
commands for that unit or building.

Research Technologies or Advance Your Civilization
--------------------------------------------------

Certain advanced commands for your buildings do not appear until you research
certain technologies or advance your civilization to a particular Age or level.

NOTE: Certain technologies, units, and commands are not available for all
civilizations by default. If you want to use a specific technology, unit, or
building, make sure that your civilization supports that technology, unit, or
building before you start the game, or enable the full technology tree for all
civilizations before you start the game.

For information about the requirements and limitations for the civilizations,
technologies, units, and buildings in Age of Empires II, refer to the technology
tree. To view information about the technology tree, use one of the following
methods.

 - When you start a single player game or host a multiplayer game, click the
   Technology Tree button ([GRAPHIC:the tree of folders]) located just above the
   Cancel button on the game configuration screen.

 - When you are playing a game, press the F2 key to open the Technology Tree
   screen.

 - Refer to the fold-out card included with Age of Empires II. This card
   includes information about the following subjects:

    - The technology tree
    - Unique attributes for each civilization
    - Technologies, units, and buildings available for each civilization
    - Unit strengths and weaknesses

To enable the full technology tree for all civilizations:

1. Start a new game in Age of Empires II.

2. On the game configuration screen, click All Techs.

3. Select any other game settings that you want to use, and then click Start
   Game.

NOTE: When you enable the full technology tree for all civilizations, you also
disable the unique attributes for all civilizations.
