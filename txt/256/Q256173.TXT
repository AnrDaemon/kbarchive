TITLE   :Possible Hang When Multiple Users Access Data on Same Dfs Share
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When two or more Terminal Server users are running a program that accesses the
same data file on the same distributed file system (Dfs) share, Terminal Server
may stop responding (hang). This behavior has occurred only with some programs.

CAUSE
=====

Because of a Dfs timing problem, a deadlock can occur in the redirector. Network
access can stop while waiting for this deadlock.

STATUS
======

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition Service Pack 6.
