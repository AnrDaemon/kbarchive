TITLE   :Remote Control Agent Does Not Listen on Assigned IP Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On dial-up computers, the Remote Control agent starts shortly after the computer
is booted (about 30 seconds after the graphical user interface appears). Upon
starting, the Remote Control agent tries to obtain an IP address on which to
listen. If there are no valid IP addresses (which is usually the case before
dialing), the agent listens on either 0.0.0.0 or an invalid, previous IP
address.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs when the computer uses Remote Access Services (RAS) to dial
into a site and is assigned an IP address by the authenticating RAS server. The
client-side Remote Control agent cannot "reset" itself to start using the newly
provided IP address.

The source of the issue is the inability to obtain the new IP address and start
listening on the new address instead of the old one.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior:

1. Install the Stop Remote Control tool (Stoprc.exe) on the client computer. You
   can install the Stop Remote Control tool by running the Microsoft BackOffice
   4.5 Resource Kit Setup program, or by copying the required files to an
   appropriate location.

2. After a dial-up connection is established and an IP address assigned, the
   client must run the Stop Remote Control tool to stop the Remote Control
   agent.

3. Run the Stop Remote Control tool again to restart the Remote Control agent,
   which then picks up the newly assigned IP address.

4. Let the Systems Management Server administrator know that the client computer
   can now be remote controlled.

NOTE: There is a difference when you run Stoprc.exe on a computer running
Microsoft Windows 95/Microsoft Windows 98 and Microsoft Windows NT. The Windows
95/Windows 98 version of the tool stops and restarts Wuser32.exe. The interval
between stopping and restarting varies from 2 to 30 minutes.

A Windows NT user must have local administrative rights to use this tool. These
rights are required to stop and start the Remote Control agent.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
