KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtool kbConfig kbSecurity kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbDiscovery kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the site code is identical to the domain name, the Systems Management
Server (SMS) Service account and Server Connection accounts experience frequent
lockouts.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because the Microsoft Windows NT Logon Server Manager and
Windows NT Logon Discovery Manager both write account information in the
Mastercfg.cfg file. One uses the domain name, and one uses the site code. If the
domain has the same name as one of the sites, they overwrite each other, causing
one or the other to use the wrong credentials.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

STATUS
======

version 2.0 and 2.0 SP1.
