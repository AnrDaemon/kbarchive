TITLE   :Cannot Log On Using SMTP Name After Running the Exchange MA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may not be able to log on to Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) from the
Compass client by using your Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) name. When you
attempt to log on with your SMTP name, the following error message may be
displayed:

   Invalid name

CAUSE
=====

Running the Exchange management agent (or any other management agent that has
the ability to update user SMTP names) can cause your SMTP name to change. The
server no longer recognizes your previous logon name.

RESOLUTION
==========

Log on with Compass to MMS by using the new SMTP name (for example,
<MyNewUsername>@<MyDomain>.com) or your distinguished name (for
example, cn=<MyUsername>,ou=<MyOU>,dc=<MyDomain>,dc=com).
