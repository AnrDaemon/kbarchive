The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 5.0a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An "Alias Not Found" error message occurs when you are opening tables in FoxPro
that were used for queries in dBASE.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur because the dBASE query indexed the table on a field from
another database, placing the key in a temporary index file. When the table is
converted, FoxPro duplicates the foreign key, but places the foreign key in the
permanent structural index for the current database. When you attempt to open
the database outside the query, an "Alias Not Found" error will occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must delete the offending index tag before you can access the file without
error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
