SUMMARY
=======

On a FAT disk partition, file and directory names containing uppercase
characters (for example, Test, teSt, and TEST) show up in File Manager as both a
long filename and a DOS 8.3 filename. The DOS 8.3 filename is visible when the
DOS Filename option is enabled from the Partial File Details option of the View
menu or when the All File Details option is chosen from the View menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS-DOS FAT file system normally only stores names in uppercase. When you
create a file or directory with mixed case, Windows NT stores that name in the
long name space to preserve the case. This necessitates the creation of a short
name. To illustrate, from a command prompt, type:

   copy con TeSt.TXT
   This is a test file. <Ctrl-Z>
   dir /x

you will see:

   ..............  TEST.TXT         TeSt.TXT

Additional query words: lfn prodnt
