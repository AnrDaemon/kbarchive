SUMMARY
=======

The following information describes the process Microsoft At Work PC Fax uses to
initialize Class 1 and Class 2 fax modems. This information is useful for
troubleshooting initialization problems--the commands below can be sent to the
fax modem using Windows Terminal to determine exactly where initialization
fails.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Any command that is specified on the SetupCommand= entry in the EFAXPUMP.INI
   file is executed.

2. The following commands are sent to the modem:

   AT&F   - Resets the modem to factory defaults
   E0     - Turns echo off
   V1     - Causes verbose responses
   Q0     - Puts the modem in quiet mode
   &C1    - Keeps DSR asserted
   &D3    - Tells the modem to reset on DTR
   &D2    - Has same affect as &D3 on modems that do not support &D3
   S0=0   - Turns AutoAnswer off
   S7=255 - Sets the training time-out to 255 seconds
   S8=    - Pause time for commas in Dial string, then either X4
            (recognize busy/dial tone) or X0 (for blind dial)
   \Q1    - XON/XOFF for Microcom and compatible modems
   &K4    - Hayes-compatible XON/XOFF command
   \J0    - Microcom command for do not send DTE/DCE (megahertz modems
            recognize this command also)
   &E5    - Multitech XON/XOFF command
   *F2    - Bidirectional XON/XOFF flow control

3. The Setup command is run again and issues an AT+FCLASS=1 or AT+FCLASS=2
   (depending on the modem class) and either answers the phone or picks it up to
   dial.
