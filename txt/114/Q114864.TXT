Method 1

      *Procedure to determine the hard drive name in FoxPro/Mac
      SET TALK OFF              && stop echo to screen
      PRIVATE x, datafolder
      datafolder="Apps:Data:"   && folder structure depends on the system
      x=LEFT(SYS(2027,SYS(16)),AT(":",SYS(2027,SYS(16))))
      * Variable X now contains the hard drive volume name
      x=x+datafolder            && set up the DEFAULT path
      SET DEFAULT TO (x) && sets default even though we didn't know HD name
      SET TALK ON

Method 2
--------

The following commands will place a list of all mounted volume names (delimited
with semicolons) in the memory variable "vol_list":

      SET LIBR to foxtools
      vol_list=fxVolume()

Method 3
--------

The following command will place the volume name FoxPro started from in the
memory variable "start_vol":

      start_vol=SET('DEFAULT')

Additional query words: VFoxMac FoxMac volume name SYS(2027) SYS(16)
