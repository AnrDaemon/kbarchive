SUMMARY
=======

The text style that was used on the outside of the Microsoft Creative Writer,
version 1.0 software box, as well as in the program dialog boxes, is a
proprietary text style and is not available as a printable font. The title text
for Creative Writer is not a font; it is a graphic.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The original name of the Adobe PostScript font is Tektron, but this font is also
available in many TrueType packages. Adobe makes a TrueType version called
Architect, and Corel makes a TrueType font called Technica. There are many other
font packages available with similar fonts. Check with your local software
dealer for their names and availability.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
