SUMMARY
=======

In FoxPro 2.6, the number of commands that can accept a LIKE or EXCEPT clause
has been increased. This article explains the functionality of the LIKE and
EXCEPT clauses, and lists some of the commands that do or do not accept the new
LIKE/EXCEPT clauses.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the following commands to create a database so that you can test the
examples listed below:

      CREATE TABLE test ;
      (afld  C(5), ;
      bfld  C(5), ;
      cfld  C(5), ;
      dfld1 C(5), ;
      dfld2 C(5), ;
      xfyd  C(5))

      INSERT INTO test ;
      (afld,  ;
      bfld,  ;
      cfld,  ;
      dfld1, ;
      dfld2, ;
      xfyd ) ;
      VALUES ;
      ('afld',  ;
      'bfld',  ;
      'cfld',  ;
      'dfld1', ;
      'dfld2', ;
      'xfyd' )

When you are using a LIKE or EXCEPT clause, you can specify a list of fields. For
example, using the table created above, the following commands would set fields
to "afld" and "bfld":

      SET FIELDS TO ALL LIKE a*, b*
      LIST

The following commands, demonstrating the EXCEPT clause, would set fields to
"bfld" and "cfld":

      SET FIELDS TO ALL EXCEPT d*, a*
      LIST

You can also use LIKE and EXCEPT together. For example, the following commands
would set fields to only "dfld1":

      SET FIELDS TO ALL LIKE d* EXCEPT dfld2
      LIST

The above statement would include all fields beginning with "d" (dfld1 and
dfld2), but would then exclude all fields named "dfld2", which leaves "dfld1".


You cannot specify a traditional field list when using LIKE or EXCEPT. For
example, the following commands would set fields to "afld" and "bfld" but not
"xfyd":

      SET FIELDS TO afld,bfld ALL LIKE x*

Only one LIKE clause and/or EXCEPT clause can be specified. A second instance of
these clauses will be ignored. For example, the following statement will set
fields to "dfld1". The "LIKE x*" portion of the command is ignored.

      SET FIELDS TO ALL LIKE d* EXCEPT dfld2* LIKE x*

You can also specify all fields that contain the specified text. For example,
this command would set fields to "xfyd":

      SET FIELDS TO ALL LIKE *y*

Of those commands that accept a field list, the commands that now accept LIKE and
EXCEPT clauses include:

   APPEND FROM ARRAY
   BLANK
   COPY STRUCTURE
   COPY STRUCTURE EXTENDED
   COPY TO
   COPY TO ARRAY
   DISPLAY
   EXPORT
   GATHER
   REPLACE FROM ARRAY
   SCATTER
   SET FIELDS
   SORT

Of those commands that accept a field list, the commands that do not accept the
LIKE/EXCEPT clauses include:

   APPEND FROM
   BROWSE
   CHANGE
   CREATE REPORT - Quick Report
   CREATE SCREEN - Quick Screen
   DISPLAY MEMO
   EDIT
   JOIN
   LIST
   SET CARRY
   TOTAL
