-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS 3.11 ships with a Remote Access Services
(RAS) driver, but it doesn't contain the files that allow you to use RAS. To use
Remote Access Services with Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, you must install the
RAS 1.1 Client software.

RAS 1.1 is available as a stand-alone package or as part of The Microsoft Network
Client software package. To order either package, call Microsoft Sales
Information Center (MSIC) Sales at (800) 426-9400.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you add the MS-DOS Remote Access media access control (MAC) driver during
the setup of Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, Setup adds the needed lines to the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file, but the actual files are not installed on the hard disk. When
the RAS Client 1.1 software is installed, its setup program adds the proper
files and completes the installation. The entries that Workgroup Add-On for
MS-DOS Setup adds to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file are as follows

   C:\NET\NET INITIALIZE
   C:\NET\RAS\ASYBEUI.EXE
   C:\NET\RAS\VCOMMIOD.EXE
   C:\NET\RAS\WANTSR.EXE
   C:\NET\NET START NETBIND

where C:\NET is your Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS directory.

The RAS 1.1 Client software does not have a setup file that works with Workgroup
Add-On for MS-DOS. To install RAS, use the following steps:

1. Change to the Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS directory (C:\NET in this example)
   and type "RASCOPY.BAT" (without the quotation marks). This is a batch file
   that extracts only the files that Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS needs for the
   installation of RAS.

2. When prompted, insert the RAS 1.1 disk in drive A. (Drive A is the only
   option.)

3. Once all the files are extracted, type "setup" (without the quotation marks)
   from the C:\NET directory and choose to install the MS-DOS Remote Access MAC
   driver.

4. After installation, restart the computer. This loads all the necessary RAS
   files.

5. Change to the C:\NET\RAS directory and type "setup" (without the quotation
   marks). This starts RAS Setup and allows for modem and port configuration.
   COM ports 1 and 2 are the only options for MS-DOS systems. Error messages
   appear and RAS does not work properly if any other COM port is entered.

6. Exit Setup. The AUTOEXEC.BAT, PROTOCOL.INI, and the COMDEV.INI files will be
   updated.

NOTE: When the AUTOEXEC.BAT and PROTOCOL.INI files are updated, the network
entries are removed, leaving no network installed. Microsoft is researching this
problem and will post more information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as
it becomes available. Continue with these instructions to complete the network
reinstallation.

1. Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Beneath the line C:\NET\NET START NETBIND, type
   "c:\net\net start" (without the quotation marks) as in the example below:

      C:\NET\NET START NETBIND
      C:\NET\NET START

2. Change to the C:\NET subdirectory and type "setup" (without the quotation
   marks). Install and set up the network interface card.

3. Exit Setup and reboot.
