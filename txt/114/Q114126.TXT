The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1c, 3.0, 3.0b, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: MS-DOS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With versions 2.1c through 3.0b of the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks MS-DOS
client, you may have difficulties reading mail under low-memory conditions. You
will receive Notice 0 (out of memory) and Notice 16 (error reading mail)
messages every time you try to read mail.

CAUSE
=====

When Mail reads a message, it attempts to load the entire text of the message
into memory. If the message text is too large to fit in available conventional
memory, Mail notifies you of the problem. However, it does not then release the
memory it allocated. Until Mail is restarted, no messages can be read.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 2.1c, 3.0, and 3.0b of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
