TITLE   :PRB: "Overwrite Invalid FoxUser File..." Each Time Fox Starts
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5x,2.6a; MS-DOS:2.0,2.5x,2.6,2.6a; WINDOWS:2.5x,2.6,2.6a,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5x, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Every time FoxPro starts, it displays the following error message:

   Overwrite invalid FoxUser file with a new empty one? Yes/No

CAUSE
=====

 - The configuration file contains a RESOURCE = line with a path that points to
   a nonexistent directory or folder.

-or-

 - The resource files are corrupt.

RESOLUTION
==========

 - Change the path in the RESOURCE = line so that it points to a valid directory
   or folder.

-or-

 - Rename the resource files (FOXUSER.DBF and FOXUSER.FPT). FoxPro will build
   new resource files the next time it starts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The configuration file is usually CONFIG.FPW in FoxPro for Windows, CONFIG.FP in
FoxPro for MS-DOS, and CONFIG.FPM in FoxPro for Macintosh.

Sample Situation That May Cause This Error When Upgrading FoxPro
----------------------------------------------------------------

This situation may occur when you are using the configuration file from a
previous installation of FoxPro with a new FoxPro installation. For example,
FoxPro version 2.5 for Windows installs to a directory named FOXPROW by default.
FoxPro version 2.6 for Windows installs to a directory named FPW26 by default.

If the following situation occurs, the RESOURCE = line will point to an invalid
directory:

1. FoxPro version 2.5 for Windows exists in a directory named FOXPROW. The
   CONFIG.FPW file in FOXPROW contains a "RESOURCE=C:\FOXPROW\FOXUSER.DBF" line.

2. FoxPro version 2.6 for Windows is installed in a directory named FPW26.

3. The CONFIG.FPW file in FOXPROW is copied to FPW26.

4. The FOXPROW directory is deleted.

At this point, the CONFIG.FPW file in FOXPROW contains a RESOURCE = line pointing
to C:\FOXPROW, which doesn't exist.
