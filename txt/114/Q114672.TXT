TITLE   :PRB: Using SELECT SQL INTO CURSOR with Same Filename

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The error message "Alias Name Already in Use" or "Alias Name Is Already in
Use"appears when a SELECT ...INTO CURSOR command is executed.

CAUSE
=====

According to page L3-866 in the FoxPro version 2.5 "Language Reference" and page
C3-704 in the FoxPro version 2.0 for MS-DOS "Commands & Functions" manual,
if you issue an SQL SELECT INTO CURSOR command, where the cursor name is the
same as the name of the table that records are being selected from, FoxPro will
close the source file and create a cursor with the same name. This information
is incorrect.

In actuality, when a cursor is created with an SQL SELECT statement, the original
table is not closed when the same name is used for the cursor. FoxPro attempts
to create the cursor with the same name although the table/.DBF is still open,
which causes the above error message. For example, the following SELECT
statement recreates the error:

      SELECT *;
        FROM Customer;
        INTO CURSOR Customer

RESOLUTION
==========

Using a different name for the cursor resolves the problem. By using a different
cursor name in the INTO clause of the SELECT command, the cursor is created
without error, as the following code example illustrates:

      SELECT *;
        FROM Customer;
        INTO CURSOR ABC
