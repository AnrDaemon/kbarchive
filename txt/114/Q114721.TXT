SYMPTOMS
========

An error occurs when you try to run a wizard.

below.

CAUSE
=====

These errors occur if the wizard table file (WIZARD.DBF) or its associated memo
file (WIZARD.FPT) is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To re-create the default Wizard table files:

1. Delete the WIZARD.DBF and WIZARD.FPT files, which are located in the WIZARDS
   subdirectory of the main FoxPro directory.

2. Start FoxPro.

3. From the Run menu, choose Wizard, and then choose All.

4. You are then prompted with the following dialog box:

   The wizard registration table cannot be located. Would you like to locate it
   or create a new registration table with default values?

   Choose Create.

5. When prompted to select a wizard, select the wizard you want to run, or
   choose Cancel to return to the Command window.

At this point, new default WIZARD.DBF and WIZARD.FPT files have been created.
