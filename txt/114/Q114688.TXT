TITLE   :RAS Can't Connect at 14400 or 19200 on TI 4000e
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot connect from LAN Manager Remote Access Services (RAS) version 1.1a on
a TI 4000e series portable computer to a Windows NT server at 14400 or 19200
bits per second (bps). After the number is dialed, you do not see any
confirmation that the computers connected.

The modem sold by TI for use with the 4000e computers is a modified U.S. Robotics
Sportster 14400.

WORKAROUND
==========

To enable this modem to work with RAS 1.1a you need to modify the MODEM.INF file
in the SYSTEM32\RAS sub-directory. Before you make any changes to this file,
make a backup copy.

In MODEM.INF, find two lines that contain the following

   <cr><If>CONNECT<carrierbps>/ARQ<cr><If>

Change both lines to read

   <cr><If>CONNECT<carrierbps>/SEL<cr><If>

RAS should now be able to dial in and connect properly.
