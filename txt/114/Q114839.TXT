TITLE   :Net Start Fails When TCP/IP is the Only Protocol
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP, version 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use TCP/IP as the only network protocol on a Windows for Workgroups
3.11 network installation (using the SETUP /N command), upon starting the
computer, when the NET START command is started and after seeing the banner for
the TCP/IP driver successful load you may receive the following message:

   ERROR 7361: IPX or NetBIOS must be running in order to load the network
   services.

CAUSE
=====

When you install Windows for Workgroups 3.11 in network mode, network
functionality is enabled by default so that the real mode full redirector loads
and the following lines are added :

   AUTOEXEC.BAT :

   NET START

   SYSTEM.INI / [Network]:

   AutoStart=FULL

The TCP/IP protocol needs to load several modules (UMB, TCPTSR, TINYRFC,
NMTSR.EXE, EMSBFR.EXE) after the NDIS2 protocol binding and before the
redirector load, and thus the error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

Edit AUTOEXEC.BAT and replace the line

   NET START

with:

   NET START NETBIND

After the lines that load other modules needed by TCP/IP (UMB, TCPTSR, TINYRFC,
NMTSR.EXE, EMSBFR.EXE) add one of the following lines:

   NET START WORKSTATION

-or-

   NET LOGON

This will correct the binding sequence of both TCP/IP and the redirector. You may
also delete the Autostart=FULL line in SYSTEM.INI and adding a NET START
WORKSTATION line after all TCP/IP components have loaded but this has the
disadvantage that any further modification using the Network Setup applet will
reinsert the AutoStart=FULL line in SYSTEM.INI, thus reenabling the error
condition. On the contrary NET START NETBIND is not modified by the Network
Setup Applet.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
