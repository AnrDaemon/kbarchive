SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to hide the user name of the last logged on user in the logon
dialog box in Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Start Regedt32.exe and locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

Add a REG_SZ value named DontDisplayLastUserName. Set the data value to 1 to
enable the new feature. A data value of 0 disables the feature.

The Last Username Display can also be hidden without editing the Registry
directly if you have the Windows NT Resource Kit.

1. Click Start\ProgramsResource Kit 4.0

2. Click Configuration\C2 Configuration

3. Double click the line that reads "Last Username Display"

4. Place a check in Hide the last username to login.

5. Click Secure then OK.
