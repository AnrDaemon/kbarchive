SUMMARY
=======

To print to a Microsoft Windows NT shared printer from a Microsoft OS/2 version
1.3 workstation, you must set up a printer in the OS/2 Print Manager with the
device pointing to the LPT port to which you have redirected your shared
printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you try to print from an OS/2 program, such as File Manager, to a printer
shared from a Windows NT machine, you get an error such as:

   Cannot print. Make sure that the default printer is installed and connected
   properly. Then try again (PMV1051).

In OS/2 Print Manager, set up a printer that points to the device you have
redirected your print jobs to, and is selected as the default printer for
Presentation Manager applications.

Procedure:

1. Net Use LPT2: \\Server\Printer1

2. In OS/2 Print Manager, choose Setup/Printer/Add.

3. Setup Printer with Device=LPT2, choose the IBMNULL driver.

4. DO NOT set up a queue for this printer.

5. In OS/2 Print Manager, choose Setup/Application Defaults.

6. Select 'Printer1' as the default printer for Presentation Manager
   applications.
