TITLE   :Modifying Configuration Files When Upgrading from Novell DOS 7
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.21

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.21 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade from Novell DOS 7 (without compression installed) to MS-DOS
6.21, you receive the following error message at the beginning of Setup:

   Your CONFIG.SYS file contains commands that are not valid MS-DOS commands.
   You can have Setup create new AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files, or you can
   have Setup disable any invalid commands it finds in your current AUTOEXEC.BAT
   and CONFIG.SYS files. If you choose to have Setup create new files, your
   original files will be renamed and stored in the root directory of your
   startup disk.

You have the following two options:

 - Create New AUTOEXEC.BAT And CONFIG.SYS

 - Modify Original Files

If you choose Modify Original Files, Setup updates the files to load MS-DOS
device drivers but does not remove all the Novell DOS device drivers. This could
result in your system trying to load more than one expanded memory manager or
disk cache.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, choose Create New AUTOEXEC.BAT And CONFIG.SYS when
you install MS-DOS 6.21 over Novell DOS 7 or manually update your configuration
files using MS-DOS Editor.
