OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

When you have an MS-DOS 6 DoubleSpace-compressed C drive and you install MS-DOS
6.21 Upgrade, Setup installs the MS-DOS files on the host drive for C. As a
result, you receive the following error message when you restart your computer
after MS-DOS 6.21 is installed:

   wrong dblspace.bin version

When this occurs, your compressed drive is left unmounted.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you boot your computer from the MS-DOS 6.21 Upgrade
Disk 1, exit Setup (BUSETUP.EXE), and then try to run Setup (SETUP.EXE) from the
A prompt.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Uninstall MS-DOS 6.21 Upgrade.

2. Boot your computer from drive C.

3. Run MS-DOS 6.21 Upgrade Setup from Setup Disk 1.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.20
