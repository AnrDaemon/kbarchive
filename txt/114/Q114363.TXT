PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.21
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.21 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install MS-DOS 6.21 Upgrade, you may have incorrect icons in the
Microsoft Tools group in Windows or Windows for Workgroups.

CAUSE
=====

Setup does not correctly create the Microsoft Tools group if the MS-DOS system
that you are upgrading contains Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows, Microsoft
Backup, and Microsoft Backup for Windows, and you select the following options
in MS-DOS 6.21 Upgrade:

 - No Anti-virus

 - No Undelete

 - Keep Existing Backup

After Setup is complete, the Microsoft Tools group contains icons for both
Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows and Microsoft Backup for Windows even though
Setup removed the Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows program files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, delete the Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows icon.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS Upgrade Setup version
6.21. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
