BUG# ODBCDBASE: 2064 (1.01.1928)

SYMPTOMS
========

The ODBC Access driver gives a "data truncated" error (SQLSTATE 01004) when you
try to update a memo field with a literal such that the total length of the
updated field is greater than 255 characters. Furthermore, the memo field is
truncated to 255 characters.

For example:

Create an Access table with a memo field in it. Insert one row into the table
such that the memo field for that row has 220 chars. SQLExecDirect the following
update statement on this table:

      update <table>
      set <memo-field-name> = <memo-field-name> + <a string of 40 chars>

SQLExecDirect will return the "data truncated" with SQLSTATE 01004; only 35 of
the 40 chars get written to the table. Further attempts to increase the size of
the memo field will fail with the same error message. The Access driver will not
let you increase the size of the memo field to beyond 255 chars via updates
using literals.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use parameter markers in the update statement and pass the memo field value
using SQLSetParam.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Access Driver version
1.01.1928. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
