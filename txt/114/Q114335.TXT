SUMMARY
=======

If you have installed more than one release of a Microsoft software development
product and are noticing strange build errors that seem, like undefined
identifiers, it is possible that you have an outdated or incorrect Visual C++ or
FORTRAN PowerStation registry. This situation can be corrected by deleting the
appropriate registry key. Exit the Visual WorkBench and follow the steps below.

WARNING NOTE: Please follow the instructions closely, because the Windows NT
installation may be corrupted if you happen to incorrectly delete the wrong
key.

1. Select the Run... option from the Program Manager's File menu.

2. Type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks) in the Command Line field and
   press [Enter].

3. Select "HKEY_CURRENT_USER" under the Window menu

4. Open the "HKEY_CURRENT_USER" folder

5. Open the "Software" folder

6. Open the "Microsoft" folder

7. Select the "Development" folder (for Visual C++ version 4.0) or the "Visual
   C++ <version>" folder (<version> may be blank or be a version
   number such as "2.0") or the "FORTRAN PowerStation" folder.

8. Press the [Del] key

9. Answer [Yes] to the confirmation Dialog

10. Close the Registry Editor (regedt32).

The Visual WorkBench will inform you that a new registry key will be created the
next time it is run.
