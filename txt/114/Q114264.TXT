SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with 32-bit file access enabled, the
Windows-based utilities in Central Point Software PC Tools for Windows (such as
Undelete and Optimize) fail, and the following error is generated:

   Exit Windows and run the MS-DOS version of this utility. Interrupt 26 (Direct
   sector write) blocked to preserve volume integrity.

=====

This problem occurs when 32-bit file access is enabled and you run any
application or utility that calls interrupt 26.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem either:

 - Disable 32-bit file access.

   -or-

 - Obtain the file FIX32B.EXE from the Central Point bulletin board service
   (BBS) or the Central Point library on CompuServe.

   NOTE: FIX32B.EXE is not supported by Microsoft. Customers must call Central
   Point for assistance with this file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FIX32B.EXE is a self-extracting file containing all the required files to allow
PC Tools for Windows Diskfix, Optimizer, and File Manager Undelete utilities to
run with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 32-bit file access. It includes "readme"
