TITLE   :Error Message When Starting Resource Kit PVIEWER.EXE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Starting the PVIEWER.EXE utility included in the Windows NT version 3.1 Resource
Kit results in this error message:

   The procedure entry point I_FtpQueryStatistics could not be located in the
   dynamic link library FTPSVC.dll

Choosing the OK button in the error message dialog box does not guarantee that
PVIEWER will display current processes.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is not with PVIEWER.EXE, but with an old version of FTPCTRS.DLL
included in the Windows NT 3.1 Resource Kit and installed into the Resource Kit
directory. Windows NT 3.5 ships with a newer version of FTP.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two possibilities:

1. If the FTP Server service is installed under Windows NT version 3.5, an
   updated FTPCTRS.DLL is installed in the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 directory.
   Renaming or deleting the older \<ResourceKitDirectory>\FTPCTRS.DLL
   should eliminate the error message and allow PVIEWER to function properly.

2. Remove the FTP Server service from Windows NT version 3.5 by means of NCPA.
   Perform a system shutdown/restart, then restart PVIEWER.
