TITLE   :HP Scanjet IIc May Fail With Future Domain TMC 1670
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to scan an image using the HP Scanjet IIc with a Future Domain
TMC-1670 SCSI controller, the system may hang and displays one of the following
error messages:

   Sorry the scanner has experienced an error

   -OR-

   Trap 0x0000000A

where the Trap appears on a STOP message.

CAUSE
=====

Unknown, although some evidence exists for isolating a cause. For instance, the
problem occurs when trying to scan images using HP Deskscan II versions 1.62 or
2.0, but does not occur when using the same scanning application with other
supported SCSI adapters.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no resolution to this problem at this time. However, a current
workaround to this problem is to use another supported SCSI adapter.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1 and
Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
