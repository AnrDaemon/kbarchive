TITLE   :Installing NT on a Ultrastor 22CA ESDI Controller
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbsetup kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT on some machines with an UltraStor 22CA ESDI caching
controller, the emergency repair disk is not created and you receive the error
"Unable to provide floppy support." If you continue, you may or not be able to
get the system to boot. Booting from the 5.25" disk and then using the 3.5"
disks to install fails with the same message. Disabling disk caching and
1024-cylinder truncation does not help. This problem was reported with the ALR
486/33. The UltraStor 22CA ESDI caching controller installed and worked
correctly on a Compaq, however.

CAUSE
=====

Only ESDI cards that are Western Digital 1003 compatible are supported. Since
each vendor implements caching differently, there is no way to write a generic
hardware abstraction layer to handle ESDI controllers from all vendors.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install an ESDI card that is compatible with the Western Digital 1003.
