======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, versions 3.2, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With the Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows driver, a Simple Messaging
Application Programming Interface (MAPI) application only sends mail and does
not receive mail from an asynchronous session with the postoffice called,
regardless of whether or not the Mail Remote driver is set to receive mail.

CAUSE
=====

When the application closes the Simple MAPI session, the spooler begins to shut
down. The spooler checks for mail in the outbox, spools the mail to an
intermediate storage location, and begins sending the mail automatically,
without prompting for user confirmation.

The Mail Remote driver cannot control the spooler, so when the intermediate
storage location is checked for mail, an asynchronous session is started; mail
is only sent, not received.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
