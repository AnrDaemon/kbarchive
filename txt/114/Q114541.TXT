TITLE   :TCP/IP-based Applications Hang on Multiprocessor Systems
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.1; :3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

TCP/IP-based applications may hang on multiprocessor systems. A sniff of the
problem shows the Windows NT machine receiving and ACKing a FIN, but never
sending its corresponding FIN.

CAUSE
=====

The TCP/IP stack does not send a disconnect indication to the application if the
packet with the FIN bit set is being processed by one processor while a previous
data packet is concurrently being processed on another processor. This can occur
when two NDIS DPCs run concurrently on the same interface, which is possible
only on multiprocessor systems.

RESOLUTION
==========

None available at this time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. For
