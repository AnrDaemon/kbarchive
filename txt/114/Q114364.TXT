======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.21 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you upgrade a Novell DOS 7 system that has compressed drives other than C to
MS-DOS 6.21, the drives are inaccessible after the upgrade because Stacker is no
longer loaded.


CAUSE
=====

MS-DOS 6.21 Setup was not tested with Novell DOS 7 and is not designed to be
installed over Novell DOS 7.

WORKAROUND
==========

You may be able to work around this problem by renaming the STACKER.BIN file to
DBLSPACE.BIN.

Additional query words: 7.0 7.00 novell
