TITLE   :Insufficient Disk Space to Install MS-DOS 6.21 Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.21,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You run out of disk space when installing MS-DOS 6.21 over MS-DOS 6.0 or later
or IBM PC DOS version 6.3.

CAUSE
=====

When you install MS-DOS 6.21 on a system that has an existing copy of Microsoft
Backup for MS-DOS or Microsoft Backup for Windows, you may get past the
4,200,000-byte minimum disk space check and subsequently run out of disk space
during Setup. On a system with MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 installed with Backup for
MS-DOS and/or Backup for Windows, the actual minimum free space required is
5,084,736 bytes.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the following steps when you receive the above
error message:

1. Exit Setup.

2. Rename or delete MSBACKUP.EXE and MWBACKUP.EXE.

3. Restart Setup.

This allows you to choose None for Backup and reduce the required free space to
install MS-DOS.
